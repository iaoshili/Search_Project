{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA sign outside the grounds of the Las Vegas Convention Center here at CES shows a new Walkman-branded product from Sony, which would mark the second hyped Walkman release in just a few months' time after the  debut of the A17 last September . The new device looks like classic Sony design, featuring a curved, matte black shell highlighted by a gold-tone headphone jack and unusual placement of the transport controls \u2014 play \/ pause and track advance all appear to be placed along the edge. It looks like it could be an evolution of the  ZX1 , which retails for an astounding £549 ($841) in the UK.\nA Walkman renaissance?\nThe device may have been teased in the company's  \"Welcome to the New World\" video from several days ago. It was assumed that Sony was hinting at a new phone with references to Android Lollipop, a vibrant display, and high-quality audio, but many of the cues could just as easily apply to a new media player. If the A17 is any indication, this new Walkman will focus on high-quality audio \u2014 Sony has been trying to lead something of a digital audio renaissance lately, calling out support for 24-bit 192kHz sound files and high-quality amps.\nOf course, there's precious little evidence to suggest that people have the tolerance to carry a dedicated Walkman on top of a modern smartphone with solid audio quality of its own \u2014 but if this all means  a glorious return to Weird Sony , I can probably be convinced.\n","Title":"A new Sony Walkman is coming to CES | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
