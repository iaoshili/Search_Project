{"Main text":"'Monument Valley' is free from the Amazon Appstore today\nAmazon is seducing Android users to its Appstore with one of the year's prettiest games\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMonument Valley is as much  an experience as it is a game. Beautiful music, charming visuals, and clever, physics-defying puzzles combine for one of the most pleasing new mobile games this year. Or so I'd heard. I never actually splashed out the perfectly reasonable $3.99 price to buy the game, but today I don't have to, courtesy of Amazon's daily  Appstore promotion . Just for today, the Android version of Monument Valley is free if you choose to obtain it via Amazon's outlet. You can do that either by downloading and installing the Amazon Appstore or  directly through Amazon's shopping app for Android . It's a chore, but a minor one compared to today's payoff.\nCorrection: Article has been amended to reflect that you can obtain Monument Valley through both the Amazon app and Amazon Appstore.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
