{"Main text":"A new Deus Ex is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided is a direct sequel to Human Revolution\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSquare Enix has just revealed Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the first major release in the cyberpunk action series since 2011's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The news comes via  a cover reveal for the latest issue of Game Informer .\nThe game is set two years after Human Revolution, and will once again star Adam Jensen as the leading character. According to Game Informer, Mankind Divided will feature not only new gameplay twists including new augmentations to play around with, but also a more open-ended structure to give you more freedom to solve challenges. Aside from that, little has been announced so far. The game is coming to the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, though no release date has been announced.\nPublisher Square Enix had apparently planned to originally announce the game through a lengthy, elaborate \"interactive reveal\" \u2014 which included an hours-long Twitch stream of a man pacing in a cell \u2014 but  a leak from a Russian website appears to have spoiled those plans. The campaign had kicked off yesterday, and included a series of cryptic clues, headlined by  the ongoing Twitch stream , where viewers could make choices to influence how a fictional interrogation would play out. All done under the banner #cantkillprogress, the teaser campaign also included  brief videos on Instagram and possibly even  a LinkedIn page .  When the campaign first kicked off , Square Enix said only that the game was the next big release from \"one of our Western studios.\"\nWhile this is the first official announcement of the game, we've known a new Deus Ex was in the works for some time. Late last year developer  Eidos Montreal teased what the next entry in the series could look like, when it announced its new game engine called Dawn Engine.\n\"The Dawn Engine will form the cornerstone for all Deus Ex Universe projects at Eidos Montreal,\" the studio explained at the time, adding that \"Deus Ex Universe is the name we are giving to the fictional world and the rich lore we are creating for it, which will of course include core games, as well as any other projects that will help bring the world of Deus Ex to life.\"\n","Title":"A new Deus Ex is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
