{"Main text":"'Please don't bring drones to the Super Bowl,' says FAA in dystopian PSA\nIn the future, only the finest rhyming PSAs will survive\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe FAA has produced a YouTube video encouraging attendees of the Super Bowl to \"leave your drone at home.\" The video, titled \"No Drone Zone,\" resembles other public service announcements, using stock photos like many anti-smoking ads and a diabolical head rhyme like  \"Don't Copy That Floppy.\"\nI've heard of end zones, but drone zones? What a country!\nWhile it's encouraging to see the FAA being proactive about drones, which can fall out of the sky anywhere \u2014 from your backyard to the  White House \u2014 a better method for protecting citizens from the misuse of drones would be proper policy. Until then, we're left with these short videos that, five years ago, would have scanned as fake PSAs from alternate reality sci-fi films. When people ask when we'll live in the future, show them this video. Nothing is more futuristic than a boring government video kindly asking the public to refrain from bringing smart flying robots that could be used to bring unspeakable horror to the most televised event in the country.\nFor your enjoyment, here's another FAA video I can't believe is real.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
