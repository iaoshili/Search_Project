{"Main text":"A high-tech hotel opening in Japan will be staffed by multilingual robots\nThe Henn-na Hotel will open this summer in the Huis Ten Bosch theme park\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis summer, a hotel will open in the Netherlands-themed Huis Ten Bosch amusement park in Nagasaki, Japan. It will have 72 rooms. Room fees will start at $60 per night. And it will be staffed by 10 humanoid robots.\nThe Henn-na Hotel's blinking and \"breathing\" actroids will be able to make eye contact, respond to body language, and speak fluent Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English,  The Washington Post reports . They will check in guests, carry bags, make coffee, clean rooms, and deliver laundry.\nHow much do you tip a robot?\nThe robot staff will be supplemented with a human staff...for now. At a news conference in Japan, Huis Ten Bosch president Hideo Sawada said, \"In the future, we\u2019d like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots.\"\nThe actroids aren't the only futuristic thing about the Henn-na. Guests will be able to unlock their rooms through facial recognition software, and radiation panels capable of detecting body heat will monitor and adjust room temperatures.\nThis isn't just some futuristic fever dream: the hotel is scheduled to open on July 17th.\nVerge Video: The most technologically advanced cruise ship (Top Shelf, Season 3, Ep. 4)\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
