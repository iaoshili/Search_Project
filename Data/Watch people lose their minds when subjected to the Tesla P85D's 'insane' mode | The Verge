{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen Elon Musk first showed off the Model S P85D, Tesla's high-end all-wheel-drive electric car, he said that his company wanted to reach the kind of acceleration achieved by the world's greatest supercars.  With the help of a dash camera , some unsuspecting victims, and the car's ability to accelerate from 0 to 60 MPH in 3.2 seconds, a P85D owner made a super sweary compilation video to show that Tesla was certainly successful in making its newest model shockingly speedy.\n\"You've gotta give people fair warning!\"\nMusk  tweeted a link to the video today, showing driver Brooks subjecting family and friends to the new P85D's ludicrous acceleration, causing squeals of surprise, dropped smartphones, and many, many curse words.  The latest model of the P85D has two motors, ostensibly designed to help the car in inclement weather, that increase the amount of acceleration the car is capable of. It even has a dedicated acceleration control  on the car's large touchscreen menu , that lets drivers select between two modes \u2014 \"sport,\" or \"insane.\"\nTest driving Tesla #p85d ...

But not every P85D passenger reacts with such primal terror \u2014 when The Verge's own Josh Lowensohn took to the P85D's passenger seat for a similar jump-start last October, his steely professionalism  helped him keep his reaction in check .\n","Title":"Watch people lose their minds when subjected to the Tesla P85D's 'insane' mode | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","transportation"]}
