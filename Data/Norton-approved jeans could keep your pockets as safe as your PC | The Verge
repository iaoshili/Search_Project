Not like that, but with a team up with San Francisco-based Betabrand to make a pair of jeans, as well as a blazer with radio frequency identification (RFID)-blocking fabrics in the pockets. Both articles of clothing promise to keep identify thieves from swiping identifying information from things like passports and contactless credit cards. The pants include two such protected pockets, one in front and one in the back where your wallet typically goes, while the blazer includes just one.\nNorton for your pants\nBoth projects were pitched as part of Betabrand's \"think-tank,\" where new product ideas bubble up and get vetted by customers. Like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, early backers get a discount on the ones that end up in production, while unpopular projects die a cold, lonely death. The jeans, which are a modified version of a popular one the company already makes (but run $20 more for the added materials), quickly garnered enough interest, while a $198 blazer has not fared as well.\nNorton, of course, makes security software and not pants, but has lent its name to the project. Betabrand CEO and founder Chris Lindland says the two companies started working together in October, and the result are these two designs, which use a silver-based material to block signals:\nThe jeans go on sale in Feburary, but for the less committed there are myriad wallets , cell phone cases , and pouches that block RFID readers. And you don't have to worry about fitting into those after the holidays.\n","Title":"Norton-approved jeans could keep your pockets as safe as your PC | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tech"]}
