{"Main text":"Next-generation condoms might feel like human skin\nResearchers hoping to replace latex with hydrogel\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCondoms made out of \"tough hydrogels\" might one day save lives, reduce unplanned pregnancies, and make safe sex a pleasure. A research team from the University of Wollongong is working to replace latex with the biomaterial, which is similar to the kind used in contact lenses. According to a release , the self-lubricated substance possesses a \"stiffness similar to body tissues,\" allowing it to potentially confer greater sensitivity. Hydrogels can also be made transparent and biodegradable to enable environmentally friendly disposal.\nstiffness similar to body tissues\nLed by Dr. Robert Gorkin, the team plans to identify potential hydrogels and a suitable \"material composition\" before examining their breaking strength, toughness, feel, permeability, and other properties. The researchers hope to eventually have people moving from \"having to\" to \"wanting to\" use this contraceptive method. \"It\u2019s really about us challenging our own perceptions, particularly when developing new technologies to be deployed in places like sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia,\" says Gorken in a statement.\nThe University of Wollongong's efforts are funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Â  which is offering grants to those aiming to create the \"next generation condoms.\" Should Gorkin's team achieve its goals, it may be awarded a $1 million follow-up grant.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
