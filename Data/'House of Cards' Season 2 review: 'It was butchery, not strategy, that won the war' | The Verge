{"Main text":"131 Comments\nStanding confidently at a podium, President Garrett Walker practices a rousing State of the Union speech before asking rather meekly if \u201Cthe frostbite bit\" is too much. Meanwhile, opposite him in the room, newly-minted Vice President Francis \"Frank\" Underwood sketches the silhouette of an excessively well-endowed bull. \"There are two types of vice presidents,\u201D Underwood says to the camera as he presents his art, \u201Cdoormats and matadors. Which do you think I intend to be?\"\nSpoiler alert: I will try my best to avoid spoiling anything important from season two \u2014 but for your own sake, you should probably drop everything and watch the first episode before going back online. I will, however, be talking about the end of season one extensively. You can check out our spoiler-heavy episode-by-episode compendium here\n\"Let's start this new chapter with a clean slate.\"\nHouse of Cards legitimized Netflix as a home for original series . The political thriller with a penchant for breaking the fourth wall wasn\u2019t without its flaws or detractors, but it won numerous awards including three Emmys and a Golden Globe \u2014 no small feat for a show created for and distributed on the internet. It also legitimized Netflix\u2019s binge-friendly strategy of releasing all 13 episodes at once, to be watched immediately. And so with season two,  I watched it all in one sitting \u2014 13 new episodes in just over 12 hours. (For health reasons alone, I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone do the same.)\nFor better and for worse, the new season of House of Cards is in many ways a continuation of the last one. Old characters go away and numerous newcomers take their places, to varying success. It\u2019s a show about Washington and power, but more than that it\u2019s about the Underwoods, a character study of a uniquely politically-adept family. And House of Cards is at its best when it realizes the rest of the world isn\u2019t nearly as compelling.\n\"I know you think I'm fundamentally deceptive.\"\nThe season premiere begins within minutes of last season\u2019s end: Frank and Claire out for a jog at night as Frank\u2019s chief of staff Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) struggles to tie up loose threads surrounding the cover-up of Peter Russo\u2019s murder. (As a refresher, you should plan on watching that finale again immediately before starting the new season.) Season two shifts focus from Congress to the White House, so the show has to quickly \u2014 sometimes ludicrously so \u2014 move to wrap up story arcs from last season. Some major characters are aggressively tossed aside, while others simply fade away in the background. Frank Underwood, through political manipulation (and even a little murder), is now the vice president of the United States.\nBy the third episode, the season\u2019s conflicts and arc become clearer, and it\u2019s in this middle chunk of episodes that House of Cards starts to drag. Episodes become structurally or thematically self-contained (e.g. \"the Civil War reenactment,\" \"the one with the quarantine\"), even if they do ultimately drive a larger narrative arc. It\u2019s almost as if the writers felt constrained by doing exactly 13 episodes again. For a show built around binge-watching, the middle portion left me decidedly less enticed to keep sprinting through. Sure, it's a chance to develop Frank and Claire more, but the show spends too much time on lesser characters that ultimately don't benefit from the exposition. By the end of episode 10 (\"Chapter 22\") all the pieces get settled and we\u2019re treated to a three-episode miniseries that aggressively barrels towards a (mostly) satisfying conclusion.\nJoining the Underwoods is a cavalcade of new characters, plus a few from season one with upgraded roles. Gerald McRaney, who plays billionaire businessman (and close friend to the president) Raymond Tusk, owns every scene he\u2019s in \u2014 even when he\u2019s playing against Kevin Spacey. The rest of the cast can be hit or miss, largely depending on their stories intertwining with the Underwoods. Even the story of Zoe Barnes, the ambitious journalist (and fan  favorite) played by Kate Mara, is largely defined by her evolving relationship to Frank. New House majority whip Jackie Sharp (played by Deadwood\u2019s Molly Parker) is a great foil for Frank\u2019s handling of the position, but suffers from a romantic subplot that overstays its welcome. That goes double for Rachel Posner, the former prostitute with connections to Peter Russo who gets a greatly expanded role for reasons I\u2019m still not entirely clear on. Less would\u2019ve been more, and as with season one, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this is 10 episodes worth of a great story stretched out to 13. (Except when it involves Freddy and his barbecue \u2014 then take all the time you want.)\n\"There is no sacred ground for the conquered.\"\nOther serialized dramas like The Wire and Game of Thrones (not to mention Netflix\u2019s own Orange is the New Black) are built on deftly juggling a large ensemble cast \u2014 it says as much about the world as it does each individual character. That isn\u2019t House of Cards. Like Macbeth or Hamlet, the story is its protagonists: Frank and Claire Underwood. Everything ultimately revolves around them, and anything else is just fat to trim. And that\u2019s okay \u2014 it\u2019s great, even, when the show is comfortable admitting that. Season two tries to spread the plot out, and it takes away from the overall experience. But I probably could\u2019ve said the same thing about season one. The new House of Cards is every bit as bingeable \u2014 for every backchannel political maneuver, for every loaded piece of dialogue, for every plate of Freddy\u2019s barbecue ribs. \"There is but one rule,\" Frank tells us early in the season. \"hunt or be hunted. Welcome back.\"\nThe second season of House of Cards is available for streaming now.
