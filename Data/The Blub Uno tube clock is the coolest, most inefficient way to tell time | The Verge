{"Main text":"The Blub Uno tube clock is the coolest, most inefficient way to tell time\nDuncan Hellmers' project is a single tube clock powered via USB connection\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSydney-based designer Duncan Hellmers is using Kickstarter to fund his retro  Blub Uno tube clock , and despite its somewhat muculent name, it looks pretty cool.\nThe USB-powered clock is made of a single  Nixie tube \u2014 a cold-cathode tube introduced in the 1950s as a way to display numbers digitally before the advent of more modern technologies like LCD. The tube houses a single glowing number in a glass cylinder, which is attached to a mount made of aluminum and bamboo. A remote control allows users to change the clock's backlighting color and to select a display mode of direct, fade, or crossfade.\nBecause the clock's face only features one digit, the time is presented as a stream of four numbers. 12:30, for example, is displayed as 1, 2, 3, 0. Hellmers' previous Kickstarter project was  the Blub clock , which featured four glass cylinders instead of one. Reading the time as four distinct digits might take some getting used to, but it helps that the Blub Uno is pretty nice to look at.\nAt the time of publication, the Blub Uno clock is only $56 AUD away from its Kickstarter goal of $7,000 AUD (about $5,416 US).\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
