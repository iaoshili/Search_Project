{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRiding off of some huge news \u2014 its  first Golden Globes win and  a major commitment from Woody Allen \u2014 Amazon is  debuting its next set of TV pilots for viewers to watch and vote on. As usual, there are a lot of options here and a lot of big names. The favorite so far appears to be an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's alternate-history Nazi novel The Man in the High Castle, which has Ridley Scott producing. The Civil War drama Point of Honor, is another interesting pilot, with Lost showrunner Cartlon Cuse behind its script. The other immediate standout is The New Yorker Presents, which is a mixture of fiction, documentary, and poetry all mashed up that tries to replicate the experience of reading the magazine.\nOther debuting pilots include the comedy Salem Rogers, which is about a former supermodel leaving rehab; the dark comedy Mad Dogs, which is an adaptation of the UK series about \"underachieving forty-somethings;\" the dark comedy Cocked, which is about a corporate suit forced to return to his rural home; and the comedy Down Dog, which is about a yoga instructor's life after a breakup. Alongside all of those comedy and drama pilots, Amazon is also debuting six pilots for children's series. This is an area that Netflix has been moving into in a strong way, too, as it's an obvious genre to jump into to make these services more appealing to parents of young kids.\n","Title":"Amazon debuts 13 new TV show pilots that you can watch right now | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
