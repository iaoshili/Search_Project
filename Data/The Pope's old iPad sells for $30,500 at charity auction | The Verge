As  Reuters reports , the tablet was purchased by an unidentified buyer who placed the winning bid over the phone. Proceeds from the sale will go to a local school for the poor.\nOn the back of the iPad is an inscription that reads: \"His Holiness Francisco. Servizio Internet Vatican, March 2013.\" It also comes with a signed certificate from the Vatican and, according to  photos published to the Castells auction house website, a black Logitech keyboard.\n( Castells )\nPope Francis has openly embraced technology during his tenure, pointing to the internet as a powerful way to foster dialogue across different faiths. Last year, he described the internet as \" a gift from God ,\" and in February, he held a  Google Hangout with children who have disabilities and special needs. He's also been an outspoken  critic of unfettered capitalism, saying it only deepens global inequality.\nThis isn't the first time that one of Pope Francis' personal belongings has been sold for charitable purposes. A Harley Davidson motorcycle he received as a gift was  sold last year in Paris for more than $320,000, with proceeds going to a soup kitchen in Rome.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
