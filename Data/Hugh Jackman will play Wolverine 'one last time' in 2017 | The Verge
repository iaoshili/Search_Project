Hugh Jackman, who has played Wolverine since 2000, will vacate the role of the most recognizable X-Man in 2017, after the third Wolverine film hits theaters.

Been toiling quietly a while now!\n\u2014 Mangold (@mang0ld) March 29, 2015\nJackman's departure is remarkable because the actor has appeared in every X-Men film since the original. The character is effectively immortal, but his recent death in the comics also proves that even Weapon X himself can't stick around forever. Jackman has expressed in the past, however, that he'd be pleased if the role were recast in some way, saying, \"It would mean that it had become iconic.\"\nIt's still unclear whether or not Jackman will appear in Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse,  due out May 2016 , but it would be odd not to see Logan in some way given the series' timeline.\n","Title":"Hugh Jackman will play Wolverine 'one last time' in 2017 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
