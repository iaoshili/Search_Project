{"Main text":"This is how rich people watched Furious 7 last weekend\nIf you've got $35,000 to spare, PRIMA Cinema is a big deal\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn the world you and I know, there are basically two legitimate, legal opportunities to catch a new flick. First, of course, there\u2019s the theater, where we pay anywhere from $10 to $30 for the privilege of sitting in a velour seat of dubious sanitation next to talkers and texters hell-bent on ruining the experience, all while our shoes stick to years\u2019 worth of petrified Coca-Cola, popcorn, and Sno-Caps. The next opportunity comes several weeks to several months later, when titles make the transition to on-demand streaming services, and eventually to other premium services like HBO and Netflix.\nThat\u2019s about it. Unless you\u2019re an oil baron or a venture capitalist, that is.\nLast Friday we were invited to the Brooklyn offices of ultra-high-end smarthome integrator  OneButton to get a demonstration of  PRIMA Cinema , which is billed as the one and only way to get first-run movies in the home \u2014 quite often on the same day that they hit theaters. It\u2019s basically a set-top box on steroids, except the box is so big that it\u2019s rack-mounted in a closet. (Also, there\u2019s a separate biometric authentication station.)\nPRIMA requires a thumbprint scan on its authenticator in order to rent a movie.\nUsing PRIMA is an interesting juxtaposition of opulence and normalcy: really, you\u2019re just watching a movie on your couch, just as you can on any one of dozens of streaming set-tops. But the fact that you\u2019re doing it with a film that just hit theaters feels special and weird \u2014 and considering PRIMA\u2019s luxury target audience, you\u2019re also probably doing it in an unusually amazing home.\nStudios don\u2019t simply sell first-run movies to anyone who wants them, because theaters are notoriously protective of their precious revenue streams, which are almost entirely predicated on getting new movies first. The notion of an affordable rental option from, say, iTunes on the same day as the theatrical release scares the hell out of the AMCs and Regal Cinemas of the world, and \u2014 for the moment, anyway \u2014 studios are generally sympathetic of their plight. All this means that getting a day-one movie release into a private residence requires a rigamarole of the highest order, and PRIMA answers the call with an extremely complex and highly secure setup. That complexity and security also affords it some degree of buffer against competition; no one else currently does this.\nNo one else currently does this\nThe only way PRIMA works \u2014 the only way studios and theaters are cool with its existence \u2014 is by being heart-stoppingly expensive and Fort Knox secure. It needs to be so ridiculous that it doesn\u2019t pose even the smallest threat to the theater business. Without user intervention, movies are automatically delivered to the PRIMA box several days before their theatrical release over its business-class internet connection at 40 gigabytes apiece. There they sit, encrypted, until the studio signs off \u2014 and that\u2019s when the biometric authentication comes into play. Only authorized users can rent a movie, which requires that they swipe their thumbprint across the futuristic, angular security terminal designed by BMW\u2019s contract design arm, DesignworksUSA. (Billionaires wouldn\u2019t be caught dead with ugly biometric scanners on their coffee tables.)\nThe \"set-top\" is actually a big, rack-mounted box with a bunch of hard drives inside.\nThe theory behind requiring the biometric authorization is that authorized users (usually just the homeowners) are less likely to invite shady characters over for a viewing party \u2014 the kinds of people who might covertly record a movie and post it online. And at $500 per 24-hour rental, you don\u2019t want someone renting Hot Tub Time Machine 2 without your explicit permission, anyway.\nThe rackmount PRIMA box is crazy, too. It has yet another thumbprint scanner, dual HDMI, dual gigabit Ethernet, dual power supplies, and a RAID 5 array where all the movies are stored. In other words, absolutely everything is redundant. \"There\u2019s no single point of failure for anything on this device,\" says Shawn Yeager, PRIMA\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \"If anything goes wrong, it\u2019s going to really have to go wrong before it upsets your client.\"\nAirtight security and redundancy everywhere\nThe box is also equipped with accelerometers and will stop working if it\u2019s moved (to quote Yeager, it \"Mission Impossibles itself\"). It\u2019s tied to an individual homeowner, and an invisible watermark on every movie identifies which box is in use. That way, if a recording does show up online, an owner can be identified and put in the hot seat very, very quickly.\nYou can\u2019t stream movies with PRIMA \u2014 everything needs to be entirely pre-downloaded ahead of time. And as with the hardware\u2019s redundancy, it\u2019s all about keeping customers happy. \"A client doesn\u2019t really care if the reason the movie is stopped is that Comcast has done something silly, or Time Warner has done something silly. All they know is they can\u2019t watch Minions, and that\u2019s your problem,\" Yeager says. That\u2019s why every available film automatically downloads well ahead of its release date. Needless to say, this system wouldn\u2019t play well with ISP data caps.\nAirtight security and redundancy aren\u2019t the only hoops that PRIMA has to jump through, though \u2014 the company encodes the films itself, and it needs artistic sign-off on those encodings. \"We actually got Insurgent a week before it was released,\" Yeager says. \"The problem was that the director hasn\u2019t signed off on the color space conversion. Unless the director signs off on the color space conversion, you can\u2019t do it. So the amount of stuff you have to go through, it\u2019s remarkable.\"\nThe interface doesn't look much different than any other digital movie service.\nAll of this is happening in the background, though. From the wealthy family\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re just chilling on their couch, powering on PRIMA from a very expensive universal remote control system and navigating it much as you would a sub-$100 streaming box or stick. Upcoming new films show as \"Coming Soon\" and quite often have trailers available \u2014 sometimes both green-band for kids and red-band for adults \u2014 while released movie rentals are just a thumbprint scan away. The system is strictly for new-release films; if you want to watch a classic, or even a movie that\u2019s a few months old, you\u2019re still going to need to fire up your gold-plated Apple TV.\nMovies look great on PRIMA. They\u2019re not 4K yet \u2014 Yeager says the company is waiting for the technology to mature \u2014 but they\u2019re encoded at 10-bit 1080p 4:2:2, which is shorthand for \"very high-quality with a lot of colors.\" If you have the system hooked up to good AV equipment and a good television (which, as a wealthy individual, of course you would), everything looks wonderful. Put it on a big enough flat-panel or projection system and I\u2019d challenge you to say it\u2019s noticeably worse than a good theater.\nThe PRIMA system wasn't a tough sell\nAs a half-dozen or so Verge co-workers lounged on OneButton\u2019s leather sofa while Furious 7 started, the PRIMA system wasn\u2019t a tough sell. The bathroom wasn\u2019t far away. The only talking was amongst ourselves. Now I understand what it means to be wealthy: it means you can watch Vin Diesel kick some ass from the comfort of your home, while the little people like me toil away in Midtown and head to a gross theater after work.\nAs I mentioned before, PRIMA is just as expensive as it sounds. The equipment alone runs $35,000 \u2014 yes, \"35\" followed by three zeroes \u2014 and the movies are $500 each (some indie titles cost less). There\u2019s no way to buy movies through the system, it\u2019s rental only. The good news is that there\u2019s no subscription fee once you get started, but new users are required to pay for ten movies ($5,000) upfront just to establish a relationship with PRIMA and make sure that everything is working correctly.\nNot to say the expense is scaring people away, anyhow: Yeager says he can\u2019t make the systems fast enough. Sell your company recently? Get on PRIMA\u2019s waiting list.\nVerge Video: Every Fast and Furious plot in 10 minutes\n","Title":"This is how rich people watched Furious 7 last weekend | The Verge","Tags":["culture","report","entertainment","tech"]}
