The latter ended late last year, and  according to The Hollywood Reporter , Simon is moving ahead with another show, this one a six-hour HBO miniseries called Show Me a Hero.\nShow Me a Hero is based on a 1999 nonfiction book by former New York Times reporter Lisa Belkin. The book follows Nicholas Wasicsko, who became the youngest mayor in America when he won a campaign in Yonkers, New York in 1987. But when Wasicsko had to oversee the building of low-cost housing \u2014 which would be occupied by minorities \u2014 in predominantly white parts of Yonkers, Belkin writes, the city nearly fell apart under his watch.\nThe Times has published the first chapter online, along with a review (as a minor caveat, Belkin did spend decades working there.) HBO reportedly just greenlit the series, and THR has published a partial cast list. Show Me a Hero will be directed by Crash's Paul Haggis, and Wasicsko will be played by Inside Llewyn Davis star Oscar Isaac, who was  more recently cast in Star Wars: Episode VII. Simon co-wrote the script and will act as executive producer.\n","Title":"'Wire' creator David Simon is making a new miniseries | The Verge","Tags":["culture","front-page","entertainment\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"garnetandblackattack"]}
