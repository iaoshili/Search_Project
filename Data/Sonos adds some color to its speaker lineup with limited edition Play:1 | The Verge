{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSonos is finally giving its speaker lineup a shot of color. The multi-room audio company has released a limited edition model of  its Play:1 speaker produced in collaboration with Blue Note Records. The legendary jazz label is commemorating 75 years, and apparently that milestone was enough for Sonos to step out from its typically neutral hardware color schemes. But you won't have long to purchase this blue Play:1, as only 4,100 of the speakers are being made. The design fades from navy to a lighter shade of blue, and Sonos claims that producing the hardware was no small effort. The coloring was \"developed through hand-painting techniques and strategic use of robots,\" according to the company.\nSonos used seven gravity-fed atomizing spray nozzles to paint the limited edition Play:1.\nThe Blue Note Play:1 will go on sale \"in the coming weeks\"  exclusively at the Sonos website (Best Buy must be disappointed about that). The fancy paint job tacks a $50 premium onto the usual cost, so you'll be paying $250 to secure one of the limited edition speakers. But the unique hardware design isn't all you're getting; Sonos says its new speaker will ship with a Blue Note on Sonos radio station powered by TuneIn. Within that station, Blue Note Play:1 owners will get exclusive access to Artist Selects, with playlists handpicked by musicians Robert Glasper, Jose James, Terence Blanchard, and Don Was, who was appointed Blue Note's president in 2012. The Play:1 is a pretty great entry point into Sonos' multi-room audio platform, and remember you can pair two of them for a richer stereo experience.\n","Title":"Sonos adds some color to its speaker lineup with limited edition Play:1 | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech"]}
