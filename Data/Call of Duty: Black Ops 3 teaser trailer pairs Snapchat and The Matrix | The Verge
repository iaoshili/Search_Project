{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe've said it before, we'll say it again: the modern media strategy of teasing teasers for trailers is tedious. And yet, here we are gazing at the first teaser for Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, trying to make any sense of this thing beyond a reminder that yes, new Call of Duty games are made available each fall, and yes, the Black Ops franchise is the next in line for said release window.\nOver footage plucked from the trash bin of the The Matrix Trilogy's editing bay, characters from the Black Ops series wax poetic on fear and doubt and masculinity, and at some point  a Snapchat QR code floats on screen just long enough that nobody could possibly miss it. Maybe there's some secret message hidden in all of this code. Or maybe it's in this image, which I kid you not is the single image Activision included with the trailer.\nHere's the same image, but with the brightness raised and a bunch of stuff circled in pink, because I like pink.\nThe end of the trailer mentions a reveal on April 26th. I'd say I'll see you then, but let's be real: either Activision will release another teaser trailer or someone will leak it before then. So let's just say, I'll see you soon.\n","Title":"Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 teaser trailer pairs Snapchat and The Matrix | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
