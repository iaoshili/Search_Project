{"Main text":"This is the official music video for Kendrick Lamar's King Kunta\nA love letter to his native Compton\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly has all the markings of a classic, and now it has  its first official music video . (Not counting  a different version of \"i\" .) \"King Kunta,\" directed by Canadian filmmaker  Director X , is a love letter to Lamar's native Compton, CA. Surrounded by friends, Lamar raps through the record's closest thing to a feel-good track in a variety of locations around the city. He dances at the Compton Fashion Center, in a parking lot, and at a convenience store, and the mood is one of total celebration.\nButterfly is  a feast for the ears , but it's the sort of epic that can feel foreboding. \"King Kunta\" is the place to start. It's catchy \u2014 one of the few songs on the record with a repeating chorus. And it has an appealing swagger to it: when Kendrick raps \"Life ain't shit but a fat vagina,\" you hear echoes of his earlier \" Backseat Freestyle ,\" with its giddy promise to fuck the world. But Kunta Kinte was of course a slave, a man  whose foot was cut off to prevent him from escaping from the plantation. Even as Kendrick brags about rising \"from a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king,\" he knows he's crippled by a country whose inattention to its founding prejudices is tragic and deadly. (Not to mention inexcusable.) The tension at the heart of the song runs straight through To Pimp A Butterfly, making it an obvious choice for a lead single. The video may cast Lamar firmly as the king, but that complicated self-doubt is still there too, if you're listening for it.\n","Title":"This is the official music video for Kendrick Lamar's King Kunta | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
