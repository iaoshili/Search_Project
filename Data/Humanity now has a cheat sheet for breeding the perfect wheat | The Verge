One of the obvious paths toward resolving that issue is crafting versions of widely used crops that can better grow in harsh environments, and among the big crops that researchers have been looking at is wheat. The genetics of bread wheat have been under investigation for years now, but today a group of researchers is publishing a draft of the crop\u2019s genome, which they say will provide the tools necessary to start planting better wheat.\nA faster way to breed just the right wheat\n\u201CIt\u2019s a fairly important information resource for breeding,\u201D Klaus Mayer, lead author of the paper, tells The Verge. Using the genome draft, Mayer says, will allow people who breed wheat \u201Cto speed up the breeding to adjust to challenges.\" That includes anything from resistance to pathogens to adapting to climate change.\nThis isn\u2019t genetic modification though. Instead, breeders would test their seeds to see if they have the specific genes that they\u2019re looking for, and then breed those seeds with other wheat until they get the perfect mixture. Effectively, it\u2019s a modernized version of what humans have been doing for ages \u2014 selectively growing whatever crops work best. Now, it can just be done much more efficiently.\nThe opportunities that Mayer lists are broad because breeders don\u2019t necessarily know how much is possible. Rather than modifying the crops to have a certain trait, breeders are in effect diving back in to the crop\u2019s history, searching for traits that can exist in wheat but have been passed over by genetics in most modern strains.\nThere isn\u2019t any one trait that\u2019s the holy grail for growing wheat, though. Rather, breeders are broadly looking to increase the crop\u2019s yield: improving the ratio of wheat that\u2019s planted to wheat that\u2019s ultimately harvested. But it can take activating one or more of many different traits to actually get there.\n\u201CThis includes things like [resistance against] diseases, pest resistance, anything like that,\u201D Kellye Eversole, executive director of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), tells The Verge. \"Also, things for droughts or too much water. It can be almost any aspect.\u201D\n\"It takes a while to put it all together.\"\nEversole\u2019s organization, the IWGSC, is responsible for the draft sequence that\u2019s being described today  by a paper in Science . It isn\u2019t the very first draft of the bread wheat genome out there, but the consortium\u2019s draft is supposed to more accurately describes where each gene is located, filling in significant limitations on an earlier version. In fact, Mayer himself was a corresponding author on the paper describing those earlier findings.\nPublishing a draft of the wheat genome is a critical addition to researchers\u2019 growing work on the genetics of plants. Together, wheat, corn, and rice make up the vast majority of grain crops grown in the world. A draft sequence for corn was published in 2008, and a draft for rice was published even longer ago, back in 2002.\nIt\u2019s fair to suspect that these developments could have a big impact on the world\u2019s food supply, should they pan out. In a separate paper  published today in Science , researchers from the University of Minnesota write that finding improvements in a few specific regions and crops could actually allow farmers to meet the hunger needs of the earth\u2019s growing population.\nThe paper also places a big focus on the actual yield of wheat, corn, and rice, as well as other leading crops. By improving their yield by 50 percent, it finds, enough calories would be generated to feed an additional 850 million people. Most likely, these gains would come in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. The paper also notes that reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus usage in fertilizers for these crops would help to cull a major source of greenhouse gases.\nIt'll still take years to put together the right genes\nIt\u2019s natural then to accept the IWGSC\u2019s obviously high hopes for what will come next for wheat with the help of their draft. In fact, the consortium says that some breeders have already started using it. Those benefits, however, likely won\u2019t be seen in the immediate future.\n\u201CIt takes a while to put it all together,\u201D says Steve Goff, the lead author on one of the 2002 papers describing the rice genome draft. \u201CA conventional breeder doesn\u2019t necessarily instantly know how to convert a genome into a molecular breeding program. There\u2019s a big technology gap there that needs to be filled.\u201D\nCompanies that think they can make a profit off of wheat will certainly help to fill it. That\u2019s been the case with rice as well, though Goff notes that it\u2019s difficult to say just how much of a difference the genome has made so far: because companies keep their work private, one can\u2019t tell exactly what was done to achieve a certain strain.\nAnd even though being able to reference a genome can allow breeders to skip years of work, it could still take upward of 10 years to get the right strain together. Eversole says her hope is for future versions of the genome to help bring that figure down to between three and five years. \u201CWe\u2019re still at the beginning of molecular breeding,\u201D Goff says, \u201Cbut it seems to be working.\u201D\n","Title":"Humanity now has a cheat sheet for breeding the perfect wheat | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
