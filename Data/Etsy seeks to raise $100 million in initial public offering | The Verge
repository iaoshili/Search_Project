{"Main text":"Etsy seeks to raise $100 million in initial public offering\nA handcrafted, artisanal stock\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEtsy, the online marketplace for arts and crafts and vintage goods, isÂ  seeking to raise $100 million in an initial public offering, the company said today. The decade-old company, founded by a carpenter named Rob Kalin, has expanded from its initial vision of a place for finding and selling handmade goods to an online storefront that now also includes mass-manufactured goods.\nEtsy, which will trade on the Nasdaq stock market under the ticker symbol ETSY, makes money from listing fees and commissions on sales. The company's revenues were $196 million last year, up 56 percent from the year before, according to the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But its losses accelerated to $15.2 million in 2014, up from $796,000 the year before. The company is run by former Yahoo executive Chad Dickerson; Kalin left the company in 2011.\nThere were 1.4 million people actively selling their wares on Etsy in 2014, the company reported, and 19.8 million buyers.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
