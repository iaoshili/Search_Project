{"Main text":"Impression Pi is everything a VR headset should be \u2014 it just can't pull it off\nMaking a wireless, hand-tracking, position-finding virtual reality headset is tougher than it looks\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\u201CEverybody agrees that at some point, you want the lightest, smallest pair of glasses or goggles, and you want to see your hands naturally, and you want to see your body naturally, and you want to feel like you're 100 percent totally there.\u201D\nOculus CEO Brendan Iribe said this a few months after his company introduced the Gear VR, a headset based around a Samsung smartphone instead of a separate computer. The wireless Gear VR frees users from being tethered to a desk, but it\u2019s hard not to wish it went further \u2014 that a \u201Cmobile\u201D headset would involve a lot more actual mobility. When Oculus acquired a hand-tracking company called Nimble VR a few months later, the future seemed clear: light, mobile headsets could let you navigate an imaginary world with your physical body, without the encumberance of a controller.\nWhile we still don\u2019t know what might end up in a finished Gear VR , a San Jose startup called uSens is trying to find this future. The Impression Pi is a Gear VR-esque headset equipped with its own set of cameras, which track both your hands and your position in a room. Its hardware is smaller, more convenient, and even sort of adorable. In theory, Impression Pi is exactly what we should be demanding from contemporary VR. But it\u2019s also an example of why we can\u2019t demand that \u2014 at least not yet.\nRight now, the Impression Pi looks a lot like many new VR headsets: a handsome design mockup and a working prototype made of foam, 3D-printed plastic, or both. In this case, the mockup is a rounded black-and-white box with a slot for a phone and two holes for cameras, giving it the look of a slightly concerned robot. When it\u2019s not in use, a plate fits onto the back, wrapping the whole thing into a self-contained package. It\u2019s still bulky by general gadget standards, but for a headset, it\u2019s relatively compact. The working model, by contrast, resembles the very first Oculus Rift prototypes. Light but blocky, it uses a built-in 7-inch screen and connects to a PC. Instead of the single pair of cameras that will be in the final model, there are three swappable sets for different features, one of which can be stuck to the headset at any given time.\nIt's bulky for a gadget, but compact for a VR headset\nThe first set handles simple video, an option also available in the Gear VR \u2014 the dual-camera setup is supposed to improve depth perception, although I didn\u2019t notice much of a difference. The second is an infrared hand-tracking system similar to Nimble VR or the Leap Motion. It looks at a small window of space and, currently, detects the fingers of one hand. The software is still very rough \u2014 it can track fully extended fingers across the entire field of view, but there\u2019s no interaction with the environment. With some tweaking, though, it could eventually tap into the existing pool of developers working on gesture-controlled projects.\nThe third set is doing something more unusual. Wired headsets can use lasers or an external camera to track where your head moves. But without special hardware like the Sixense STEM, mobile ones like the Gear VR can only tell how it\u2019s tilted, something Oculus CTO John Carmack has admitted is a problem. Impression Pi flips the traditional tracking setup around: the headset\u2019s internal infrared cameras can \"read\" the environment and shift as a user moves. For better results, there\u2019s a separate laser projector that shines a distinctive pattern on the wall, providing a firm frame of reference.\nImpression Pi promises a lot with this. A Kickstarter video shows a woman walking down a real-life flight of stairs that she sees as a virtual cave floor. (No matter how good positional head tracking gets, please do not ever do this, if you value your life.) In another example, designers scan an environment and add augmented reality elements. In reality, it\u2019s a long ways away. After some calibration, the Impression Pi could shift around slightly as I moved, but it was either barely noticeable or subject to random jumps. The laser patterns worked better, but not by much.\nPlease do not walk down stairs blindfolded\nA lot of this seems like a software issue, and the current tech demos are too simple to get a good idea of how it might improve. But even at best, tracking is finicky; John Carmack has said he considered the idea of using an internal camera for virtual reality, but decided it would be too jittery and imprecise. It\u2019s also a potential battery-killer. For the prototype, that doesn\u2019t matter, but on the phone-based model that\u2019s selling for $279 on Kickstarter, it\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s an even bigger deal for the $359 \"master\" package, which includes its own integrated, high-resolution screen and an Android-based interface (which doesn\u2019t exist yet). The phone-based headset will support the iPhone and a range of Android phones, so battery life will vary there. Company CTO Yue Fei says he\u2019s aiming for up to four hours of gameplay on the all-in-one headset \u2014 but it might be more like two.\nFei says he\u2019s got some major manufacturers already on board, and a new sensor will allow him to combine all the Impression Pi\u2019s functions into one pair of cameras. The phone-based headsets are supposed to ship to backers in November, giving uSens eight months to fix the ergonomics, get six cameras down to two, fit those cameras inside the headset, and release a software development kit. The all-in-one headset is listed as shipping in December, but Fei said there\u2019s no hard timeframe, and it could slip into 2016.\nThe Impression Pi ties simple pieces of VR hardware together in a way few other companies have done. It\u2019s trying to fix the Gear VR\u2019s biggest flaws: its awkwardly not-quite-portable hardware, its limited control options, and its total lack of positional tracking. The problem is, those flaws exist because they\u2019re really hard to overcome. Virtual reality of the \u201880s and \u201890s was full of big ideas that were way too advanced for their actual hardware. The Impression Pi might be one of our first modern examples. It\u2019s an interesting project, but if it\u2019s going to be a fun or useful one, it\u2019s still got a long ways to go.\n","Title":"Impression Pi is everything a VR headset should be \u2014 it just can't pull it off | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","hands--on","entertainment"]}
