{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDear Verge readers,\nLater this morning, you\u2019ll be able to read and watchÂ  our amazing feature on Zombie 222 , a 1968 Ford Mustang fastback that\u2019s been converted to a state-of-the-art, wicked fast electric drivetrain. It\u2019s beautiful, weird, low-tech, and high-tech, all at the same time.\nIn many ways, it ticks all the boxes that I\u2019d want in order to tell a great Verge story. It\u2019s a perfect example of why it makes so much sense for us to cover the things that move us \u2014 cars, planes, trains, hyperloops, so on \u2014 with the same vigor and passion that we\u2019ve long applied to consumer technology.\nI\u2019ll cut right to the chase: I\u2019m delighted to announce that we\u2019re launching comprehensive coverage of transportation here on The Verge. You can find it at theverge.com\/transportation , on our home page (notice that new \"Cars\" link at the top!), and everywhere else across the internet where you\u2019ve come to expect us.\nIt's no April Fools' joke. In fact, it might not come as a surprise to some of you, since it\u2019s an extension of stories we\u2019ve already been unable to resist. Perhaps you noticed our coverage of incredible cars like the Mercedes-Benz F 015 , the BMW i8 , and the Tesla Model S P85D in the past, among many others. But consider this formal notice that we intend to create the most exciting and dynamic transportation coverage the world has ever seen.\nIt\u2019d be a terrifying undertaking if we were starting from scratch, but we\u2019re building all of this on top of The Verge \u2014 a powerful, proven foundation that gives us the experience and the platform to make it possible. (We\u2019ve already expanded our coverage of science and entertainment in exciting ways under the leadership of Liz Lopatto and Emily Yoshida, and we certainly didn't intend to stop there.) I know The Verge well; I know what we\u2019re capable of. This is going to be fun, and I\u2019d like to invite you to ride along.\nLook for more transportation news, videos, features, and announcements in the coming months, but in the meantime, please enjoy Zombie 222 and our reporting from the floor of the New York International Auto Show , which is happening right this very second.\nAnd don\u2019t forget:\n","Title":"The Verge does cars: our official Transportation hub has launched | The Verge","Tags":["announcement","transportation"]}
