{"Main text":"HBO shows are now streaming on Amazon Instant Video\n'True Blood,' 'Six Feet Under,' and more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs promised, a number of HBO shows are now available to stream through Amazon Prime Instant Video. Starting today, you'll be able to stream the complete run of older shows like The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, The Wire, Eastbound & Down, and Flight of the Conchords. For newer shows like Treme, True Blood, and Boardwalk Empire, meanwhile, only select, early seasons are available.  Amazon and HBO announced the partnership last month , which will eventually include much more recent series like Girls and Veep, but not until three years after they air on HBO. And even though mega-hit Game of Thrones is absent, the deal still provides Amazon with a solid advantage in its streaming war with Netflix.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
