Now, the company has put together a gorgeous nine-minute vignette starring Tokyo's custom vehicle scene.\nThe video is the second episode in the HERO4: The Adventure of Life in 4K series, which uses GoPro's latest  sports camera Hero4 exclusively. Delivered as a mini-documentary of sorts, it offers a glimpse into the local street racing culture, and its  stunning armament of customized supercars and sports bikes. Interspaced with these glittering images of nocturnal Tokyo are personal stories from those embroiled in this high-speed world, told between luxurious shots of the city itself.
