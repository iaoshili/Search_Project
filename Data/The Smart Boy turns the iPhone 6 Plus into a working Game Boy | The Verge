{"Main text":"The Smart Boy turns the iPhone 6 Plus into a working Game Boy\nWhen a joke is no longer a joke\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Smart Boy is part of a new breed of April Fools' jokes that double as market testing. They're jokes! Unless you really like them, in which case they're marketing!\nThis particular concept art, published on accessory manufacturer Hyperkin's Facebook page on March 31st, was described as upcoming hardware that will clip onto an iPhone 6 Plus (and eventually other smartphones), and play Game Boy and Game Boy Color cartridges on the screen. The design scanned as a joke, looking like someone cut loose the lower half of the classic Nintendo portable and molded what remained around an iPhone.\nBut on April 1st, Hyperkin posted a second update:\n\"A lot of you were speculating that the Smart Boy is an April Fools' Joke. Well, it sort of was. We \"leaked\" it with the initial intent of testing the market, seeing whether or not it should be something we'd actually make, under the guise of an April Fools' Joke.\"\nThe post confirms the Smart Boy is now in development.\nVerge Video: The best portable game console\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
