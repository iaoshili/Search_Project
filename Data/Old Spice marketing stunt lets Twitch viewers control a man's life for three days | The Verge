{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHow do you get the attention of the hordes of young men who watch live streams of video games on Twitch? If you're Old Spice, you try a goofy marketing stunt. The men's grooming brand \u2014 best known for its ludicrous advertisements and pungent fragrances \u2014 has hired a \"nature man\" to wander around the woods and do whatever the internet pleases. As  the company explains , \"This man we have placed in the bounteous grandeur of nature is contractually obligated to do everything you, and millions of other Internet users, tell him to do.\"\nIf that sounds familiar, that's because it is. This marketing exercise is essentially a \"real-life\" version of  Twitch Plays Pokémon , a Twitch phenonmenon from last year that saw tens of thousands of people at once try to play Pokémon Red and other classic Pokémon  games. Of course, that was a video game \u2014 now Old Spice's marketing gurus have decided it'd be a good idea to  let jokers on the internet tell a poor person what to do . To keep the \"fun\" from getting out of control, the \"wilderness\" that the \"nature man\" explores from April 16th through the 18th for 10 hours each day has been carefully set up for marketing potential. That means that poisonous berries have likely been removed and instead of real animals, there will be actors in suits. The forest also has talking trees, apparently.\n\"This man ... is contractually obligated to do everything you, and millions of other Internet users, tell him to do.\"\nOld Spice is likely considering this whole thing an experiment at this point \u2014 like many other companies, it is trying to find how to best embrace the relatively new arena of live-streaming as part of its marketing plans. Most traditional ads on Twitch and similar sites are pre-roll video ads \u2014 often repurposed from television campaigns \u2014 and typical banner ads. Old Spice likely hopes that this new approach, which is tailored for the live-streaming site, will better resonate with its target audience.\n","Title":"Old Spice marketing stunt lets Twitch viewers control a man's life for three days | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
