{"Main text":"Amazon gets its first major award nominations with Transparent\nOriginal series earns Golden Globe nods for best TV comedy and best actor\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon and Netflix are about to square off during Hollywood awards season. Transparent, the acclaimed Amazon original series fromÂ Jill Soloway, has earned a Golden Globe nomination for best comedy TV series. It's the first time Amazon has really broken through with one of its own shows; previous attempts have fallen flat and failed to stand up against network programming and established Netflix hits like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. (The latter was also nominated for best TV comedy.)\nBut with Transparent, Amazon has finally turned things around. Critics and viewers alike have been raving about the series and lead actor Jeffrey Tambor's performance ever since the show started streaming on September 26th. Tambor has deservedly picked up a nomination for best actor in a comedy series.\nBirdman also scored big with Golden Globe nominations. The Michael Keaton-led comedy has earned seven nominations in all \u2014 more than any other film this year \u2014 including best comedy, best actor in a comedy, best director, best supporting actress, best supporting actor, and best original score. FX's Fargo also fared extremely well with seven nods; it's up for best miniseries, and Colin Hanks has been nominated for best supporting actor in a miniseries.\nThe full list of nominations:\nBEST MOTION PICTURE - DRAMA\n","Title":"Amazon gets its first major award nominations with Transparent | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
