Instead, the whole thing might be settled with a drift competition. BMW has apparently begun the preliminaries, with this short clip showing the car manufacturer's self-drifting 2 Series squaring off against (or, rather, circling around) Japanese flesh-and-blood drift champion Dai Yoshihara.\nperforming Donut after donut, with clock-like accuracy\nBMW first showed off this technology at  CES last year , but they've apparently been finessing their technique, progressing from  skidding round a track to performing donut after donut with unerring, clock-like accuracy. Although it has to be noted that in the trailer above, BMW has the advantage of drifting on a wet surface \u2014 Yoshihara has the much tougher task of performing on dry tarmac.\nThe car manufacturer says this is all about showing how self-driving cars can handle themselves in difficult conditions (something they also highlighted with their  un-crashable i3s back in January ), but we've got our fingers crossed it's all leading to an apocalyptic drift-off. Think Transformers meets The Fast and The Furious, with Vin Diesel as humanity's champion talking smack to a 6-foot-tall ASIMO wearing aviators. \"Oh yeah? Well your daddy was a smart fridge and your mama stacked shelves for Amazon.\" Glorious.\n","Title":"Watch BMW pit man against self-driving machine in the ultimate drift challenge | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","tech","transportation"]}
