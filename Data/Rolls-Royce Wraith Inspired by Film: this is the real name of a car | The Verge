Take Bugatti, for instance, which has only had a single proper model in the past decade. That's understandable, but it also leaves these companies with vast spans of time where they don't really have anything truly new to announce \u2014 so they make up the difference with a never-ending stream of 1-of-1 special editions launched at motor shows around the world, each with a more absurd name than the one before it. The  final Veyron wasn't just called La Finale; its full name is Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse La Finale. That's a six-word name. Many people haven't owned six cars in their entire lives.\nRolls-Royce plays this game as well as anyone, but its latest one-off Wraith being shown at the New York auto show this week takes the naming convention to another level: it's called the Wraith Inspired by Film. Actually, if I'm interpreting  the press release correctly, the proper nomenclature is Wraith 'Inspired by Film,' but I'm inclined to drop the single-quote marks around here.\nThe name celebrates the archival of And The World Stood Still, the Wraith's launch film, into the British Film Institute's National Archive. But like most one-off Rollers with special names, the Wraith Inspired by Film isn't any more unique than any of the marque's other bespoke, hand-built beasts: it has an anthracite \/ tan leather treatment, gorgeous ebony paneling, and a two-tone paint job set in \"Silver and Jubilee Silver.\"\nIt's an absurdly beautiful car, as Wraiths tend to be. And don't forget, it's inspired by film.\n","Title":"Rolls-Royce Wraith Inspired by Film: this is the real name of a car | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
