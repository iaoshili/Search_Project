{"Main text":"Sylvester Stallone is producing an Expendables TV miniseries\nNo word on the rest of the cast yet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSylvester Stallone's Expendables franchise is moving to television.  Deadline reports that Fox is developing a miniseries based on the increasingly dull, half-comical assassin trilogy. Stallone is set to co-produce alongside the films' original producer Avi Lerner. No details on the cast have been announced.\nThe Expendables started out as a promising goof on action movie tropes, but only seemed to get worse with the release of each movie. We can't say  we're exactly begging for more . But we're going to get more, whether we like it or not. It's unlikely Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Bruce Willis will be up to doing a TV reboot, but maybe Fox can snag Kelsey Grammer?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
