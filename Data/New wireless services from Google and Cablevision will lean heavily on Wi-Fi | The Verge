{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt looks like Republic Wireless \u2014 the upstart cellular service that uses Wi-Fi and falls back to Sprint when necessary \u2014 was onto something when it  launched back in 2011 .\nRumors have  popped up in recent days that Google is prepping to launch a wireless MVNO that uses both Sprint and T-Mobile airwaves in the coming months, and  WSJ now reports that it'll use Wi-Fi, too. Presumably, phones that use Google's service will choose Wi-Fi as a default since it's far cheaper per kilobyte than cellular, but Sprint and T-Mobile would be available as a backup when a hotspot isn't available. Of course,  this isn't the first time Mountain View has been tied up in wireless rumors ; WSJ notes that the service has been delayed internally, and it's entirely possible it'll be delayed again (or shelved entirely).\nTurns out Republic Wireless was onto something\nMeanwhile, the Journal also reports that Cablevision is launching a Wi-Fi-based phone service next month, Freewheel, which will run $9.95 for the cable company's existing customers and $29.95 a month for everyone else. (Republic Wireless' Wi-Fi-only plan, for comparison, is $5 per month.) It's starting in New York, but will eventually be available nationwide. Naturally, it'll include access to Cablevision's Optimum Wi-Fi hotspots. The only phone available at launch, though, will be the low-end  Moto G \u2014 not necessarily an attractive option for bleeding-edge types who are trying to escape traditional cell services.\nFor companies without access to cellular spectrum \u2014 which is basically everyone outside a small collective of longtime wireless operators \u2014 Wi-Fi service is becoming far more practical thanks to the proliferation of hotspot networks,  some of which are powered in part by customers' own homes . With decent service, a cellular fallback, and prices considerably below what the big four nationals can offer directly, Google could have a winner on its hands.\n","Title":"New wireless services from Google and Cablevision will lean heavily on Wi-Fi | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
