What is there to look forward to afterwards? Let\u2019s watch some of the latest trailers and find out.\nPenny Dreadful\nJudging from this trailer, Showtime\u2019s latest series takes quite a bit of inspiration from the likes of American Horror Story \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make it any less unsettling. Created by screenwriter and playwright John Logan (Skyfall, The Aviator), the show takes place in a ghastly turn-of-the-century London where some of horror\u2019s classic literary figures are given the chance to intermingle. It\u2019s set to debut this May \u2014 and we\u2019ll certainly be watching.\n22 Jump Street\nThe directing duo of Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The Lego Movie, 21 Jump Street) have a track record of taking concepts that could be questionable in someone else\u2019s hands, and turning them into memorable movies instead. Now they\u2019re reteaming with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum for a Jump Street sequel where the two leads go undercover in college. Sure, it\u2019s the set-up we all knew was coming \u2014 but with Lord and Miller at the helm, it\u2019s all about the ride.\nLocke\nIn this UK thriller Tom Hardy plays a construction manager whose life begins to unravel over a series of phone calls. The catch? It all happens in real time while he\u2019s in his car, and the film never leaves his side the entire time. The concept sounds like it could result in a gimmicky exercise, but Locke has been impressing critics at film festivals across the world. Audiences will get a chance to decide for themselves this April.\nNot Safe For Work\nAfter Captain America: The First Avenger director Joe Johnston took the obvious follow-up gig: making a low-budget horror flick. Max Minghella (The Social Network) stars as a paralegal who happens upon some murder and mayhem while working late at the office. Despite Johnston\u2019s pedigree, however, this one is bypassing theaters and going straight to video on demand instead.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018Penny Dreadful,\u2019 \u201822 Jump Street,\u2019 \u2018Locke,\u2019 and \u2018Not Safe For Work\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
