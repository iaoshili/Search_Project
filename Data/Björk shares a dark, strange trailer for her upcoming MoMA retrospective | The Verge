The exhibit, Björk, will act as an experimental timeline of Björk's art, drawing from her more than 20 years as a musician and visual artist.\nThe exhibition's centerpiece is called Black Lake\nThe dark, corporal trailer above is for the exhibition's centerpiece, a video installation called Black Lake. The installation shares its title with a track from Björk's  recently leaked album, Vulnicura .   According to Rolling Stone , Black Lake is a visual collaboration between the design firm Autodesk and the director Andrew Thomas Huang. Huang also directed Björk's elaborate video for  \"Mutual Core\" off her 2011 album Biophilia. The Black Lake trailer doesn't reveal much, but it's enough to get our anticipation senses tingling.\nThis isn't the first time Björk has joined forces with the museum. Last year, Björk's  Biophilia app was the first app to be  accepted into MoMA's permanent collection . This is, however, the first ever retrospective exhibition of Björk's work. Björk will feature songs from all eight of Björk's full-length albums backed by experimental video installations, costumes, interactive audio experiences, and narrative retrospectives. Only 100 visitors will be allowed to enter the exhibit at one time.\nBjörk will be on view at the MoMA from March 8th to June 7th, 2015.\n","Title":"Björk shares a dark, strange trailer for her upcoming MoMA retrospective | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
