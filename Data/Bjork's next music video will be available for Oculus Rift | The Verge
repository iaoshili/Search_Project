{"Main text":"Bjork's next music video will be available for Oculus Rift\nIt's for her song \"Stonemilker\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn 2013, Bjork released her heightened, futuristic album Biophilia as an app . That album's follow-up, Vulnicura, leaked months ahead of schedule  earlier this year , and Bjork already has some innovative plans for it. In a recent  interview with Fast Company , the musician talked about her decision to keep Vulnicura off Spotify, her  upcoming retrospective at MoMA , and the music video for her song \"Stonemilker.\" The video, directed by Bjork's longtime collaborator Andrew Thomas Huang, will be available for Oculus Rift.\nApps are punk, Oculus Rift is not\nWhen asked about how she chooses to pair technology and music, Bjork said, \"It can\u2019t just be working with the gadget for the sake of the gadget. But also it\u2019s about budgets. You can do apps cheaply. Apps was kind of punk, actually. It was like starting a punk band again. Filming for Oculus Rift is not.\"\nThere's no word yet when the \"Stonemilker\" video will be released or what it will look like. Bjork's MoMA retrospective will open on March 8th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
