{"Main text":"Weird Al parodies corporate buzzwords in final 'Mandatory Fun' music video\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on July  21, 2014 11:48 am\nWeird Al's  final song in his eight days of music videos is sort of like your company's CEO on Auto-Tune: a bizarrely compelling string of often-meaningless buzzwords that sound great together. Called \"Mission Statement?,\" the song parodies the style of Crosby, Stills & Nash with a near-constant self-harmony of Al's vocals over a bit of jangling and quiet guitar. As for the lyrics, it's hard to say if they really mean anything in a straightforward way. His lines might make sense from moment to...\nIn order to holistically \/ administrate exceptional synergy\nUpdate\nWeird Al adopts Southern rock style for 'Lame Claim to Fame' music video\nBy Dante D'Orazio on July  20, 2014 11:58 am\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic is putting on his trucker hat and grabbing a cowbell for his latest music video, \"Lame Claim to Fame.\" The stop-motion animated video is the seventh in his series of eight music videos for his new album Mandatory Fun, and it's arguably one of the most creative so far. Notably, the video features DJ Dr. Demento, who helped bring Weird Al to the national stage with his radio show.\nThe song itself sounds like something you'd catch while flipping through the radio stations on...\nI used the same napkin dispenser as Steve Carell \/ At a Taco Bell.\nUpdate\nWeird Al turns hashtag into song with 'First World Problems' music video\nBy Dante D'Orazio on July  19, 2014 12:25 pm\nWeird Al's  eight days of music videos for his album Mandatory Fun sure seems perfectly designed to take the internet by storm. In today's ridiculous video, \"First World Problems,\" the one-of-a-kind artist has transformed a list of Twitter rants into a song that pokes fun at bands like the Pixies. While Weird Al's self-proclaimed \"douchey\" alter-ego in the video has some perennial problems, like missing breakfast because he overslept, many of his complaints are right up to date for 2014. \"My...\nMy house is so big \/ I can't get Wi-Fi in the kitchen.\nUpdate\nWeird Al parodies Iggy Azalea's 'Fancy' with music video of a strange handyman\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on July  17, 2014 11:21 am\nWeird Al is taking on Iggy Azalea's sassy single \"Fancy\" for the fourth in his planned eight days of music video releases to promote his new album, Mandatory Fun. As he did with  his parody of Lorde's \"Royals\" yesterday , Al twists \"Fancy\" into a strange sort of advertisement \u2014 this time for handyman services in a song appropriately titled \"Handy.\" It's hard to keep up with Azalea's energy, but as you'd expect, Al does an impressive job of translating it into the voice of his overly...\nI can solve that with some duct tape and some caulking.\nUpdate\nWeird Al rants about the Illuminati in parody of Lorde's 'Royals'\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on July  16, 2014 11:49 am\nWeird Al is getting a bit weirder for day three in the eight days of music video releases to promote his new album, Mandatory Fun. This third parody is of Lorde's breakout single \"Royals,\" which Al twists into a strange infomercial for aluminum foil. The song, called \"Foil,\" translates surprisingly well, but it's partway through that things start to get really odd. \"Oh by the way I've cracked the code,\" Al sings. \"I figured out these shadow organizations \/ and the Illuminati know \/ that...\nThe Illuminati know \/ that they're finally primed for world domination.\nUpdate\nWeird Al's 'Blurred Lines' parody skewers Reddit and doge for grammar crimes\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on July  15, 2014 12:10 pm\nWeird Al plans to release a new music video every day for eight straight days, and for day two he's taking on Robin Thicke's infectious (and controversial) single \"Blurred Lines.\" Al's version is called \"Word Crimes,\" and it's a general send-up of people with poor grammar. \"If you can't write in the proper way \/ if you don't know how to conjugate,\" Al opens, \"maybe you flunked that class \/ and maybe now you find that people mock you online.\" Al eventually delves into some brief grammar...\nYou'd better slow down \/ and use the right pronoun.\nOriginal Story\n10 months ago 87\nWeird Al releasing a new video every day for eight days, starting today with 'Happy' parody\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on July  14, 2014 05:38 pm\nWeird Al has a new album of parodies coming out tomorrow, but you'll probably want to look for them on the web rather than over the radio: eight songs off of the album are getting music videos, and they'll be premiering over eight days. The first video  came out this morning and has Al singing \"Tacky,\" a parody of Pharrell's unbearably catchy hit \"Happy.\"\n","Title":"Weird Al releasing eight parody videos in eight days | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
