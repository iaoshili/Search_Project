{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOn February 26th, The FCC plans to vote on helping two communities overcome state laws that've impeded their ability to build out municipal broadband networks.  The Washington Post reports that Tom Wheeler is likely to circulate a draft decision to commissioners this week. Last month, the commission  signaled it would be taking up petitions from Chattanooga, Tennessee and Wilson, North Carolina, two cities looking to create their own, local alternatives to service from powerful ISPs like Comcast.\nEach wants the FCC to overturn state laws that have become barriers to progress in that effort. Tennessee, for instance, severely restricts just where cities can build out the infrastructure necessary for high-speed broadband. And as The Washington Post notes, public internet providers in North Carolina are forbidden from offering prices lower than those available from Comcast, Verizon, and other private businesses. Similarly burdensome laws extend to many other states, as well.\nThis is just the beginning of a long battle\nAny steps the FCC takes to help Chattanooga and Wilson get over those hurdles will be tailored to the circumstances in those cities alone. But the commission's reasoning \u2014 that state laws are needlessly stalling deployment of broadband \u2014 will likely be applied to similar arguments between cities and ISPs as they pop up across the US. The FCC believes section 706 of the Communications Act gives it the necessary authority to intervene in circumstances where broadband deployment is being held back.\nBut Republican lawmakers (in a GOP-led Congress) disagree and have floated legislation to  dial back the powers granted to the FCC by section 706 . President Obama has voiced his desire to see the FCC dismantle state laws that have handcuffed cities trying to compete with massive corporations \u2014 a strategy supporters believe this will result in better prices and  improved broadband speeds for consumers. February 26th is shaping up to be a big day for Wheeler's FCC; the commission is preparing to  vote on new net neutrality frameworks on the same date.\n","Title":"FCC will hold crucial municipal broadband vote on February 26th | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
