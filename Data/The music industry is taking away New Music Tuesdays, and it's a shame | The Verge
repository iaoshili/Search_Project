{"Main text":"The music industry is taking away New Music Tuesdays, and it's a shame\nThe club must go up on a Tuesday\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday is Friday. TGIF. For most countries, it\u2019s the last day of the workweek and the first day of the weekend. Friday has been reserved for some great events. Good Friday. G.O.O.D. Fridays. Black Friday. Friday night lights. It\u2019s even pay day for some. House of Cards season 3 was released today . Fridays are great for a lot of things, but new music isn\u2019t one of them. Yet here we are.\nThe record industry is adopting Friday as the global album release day this summer . Among the evidence supporting this decision is Beyoncé\u2019s surprise self-titled album, which was released on a Friday and went HAM , selling 828,000 copies in 72 hours. And then Drake did it again, selling 495,000 units of If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late in 96 hours. The industry also apparently believes a single release day will stem piracy (it won\u2019t). And of course, it can\u2019t make any money and will do anything to change that. All of this would be fine \u2014 go get your money, try to stop piracy, believe in your heart that everyone can do Beyoncé numbers \u2014 but they picked the wrong day.\nAlbum releases shouldn't have to be planned around Marvel movies\nFor years Tuesdays have been the official release date for new music in the US. New Music Tuesdays have been a staple in the culture. You get a night to listen to your new album for a night, and then talk about it the next day with your friends at work or at school. Those \"did you hear\" discussions \u2014 I\u2019ve bought dozens of albums off of those \"did you hear\" talks. Friday releases kill those exchanges. When you say \"did you hear\" on Monday, what \"you heard\" is already old news. Decisions on whether the album is any good have already been made. GIFs have been used. The album becomes last week\u2019s news, and no one wants to be last week\u2019s news.\nEveryone isn't Beyoncé\nFriday is also the the day new movies are released in theaters. That means record labels will now have to make sure Marvel isn\u2019t dropping another blockbuster on the same day as an album release. Not everyone is a Beyoncé or Drake. Not everyone can release albums in the middle of the night and cause worldwide hysteria. (And using Beyoncé as proof Friday releases can work worldwide is just asinine. Beyoncé could have been released during the Super Bowl and people would have stopped paying attention to download it.) There are only a select few artists in 2015 who possess that power. (The List: Beyoncé, Drake, Adele, Kanye West, Taylor Swift, Jay Z, no one else.) For the everyone else, there will be a genuine question of whether people will buy your album or go see that new movie.\nThe International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), who represents music labels around the world, did a survey of seven countries showing that \"nearly 7 out of 10 people\" want new music released on Friday or Saturday. \"An aligned global release day puts an end to the frustration of not being able to access releases in their country when the music is available in another country.\" IFPI CEO Frances Moore said . Sure. Okay. That\u2019s a problem for everyone without YouTube, but it\u2019s 2015.\nThe primary goal for this shift is to curb piracy before an album is released. The thinking is that one worldwide release will eliminate the period in which an album can be pirated before its release in the US. But the problem with that is just about every album is leaked three days before it hits physical stores. It doesn't matter when the commercial release date is if a physical copy exists somewhere in the world before that day. One release day is a good idea in theory, but there\u2019s only one way to stop piracy before an album is released \u2014 stop making physical copies.\nThere\u2019s only one way to stop piracy before an album is released \u2014 stop making physical copies\n\"Music fans live in the digital world of today,\" IFPI boss Frances Moore wrote in his statement. Jay Z and Kanye West figured out that we live in \"the digital world of today\" when they released Watch The Throne back in 2011. It was available online-only for the first four days of its release, before it hit brick and mortar stores ( it didn\u2019t leak ). But retailers were upset . Then Beyoncé did it in 2013 (it didn\u2019t leak). And retailers were mad again. Drake did it a few weeks ago (it didn\u2019t leak). This time retailers didn\u2019t even get the album, and haven\u2019t said a word. The cure for the album leak epidemic has been sitting in front of the music industry for nearly four years, and they haven\u2019t figured it out yet. If you want to stop albums from leaking early, stop making physical copies before the album is available.\nSo to the IFPI and those in power in the music industry: the answer to your piracy problem is:\nThe Internet (how ironic!)\nNot going up against Marvel, or Fast & Furious 13, or Fifty Thousand Shades of Grey.\nNow can we have our Tuesdays back? The club can\u2019t go up them without new music.\n","Title":"The music industry is taking away New Music Tuesdays, and it's a shame | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","music"]}
