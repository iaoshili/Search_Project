{"Main text":"This man is asking for $2 million on Kickstarter to find Amelia Earhart\u2019s plane\nDana Timmer believes the famous wreck is 18,000 feet below the Pacific\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSeventy-six years ago, Amelia Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan set off on the most dangerous leg of a flight around the world, the 2,556-mile journey from New Guinea to Howland Island in the Pacific. They were never seen again. The rescue team gave up after a 17-day search and the incident was \"officially set down... as one of aviation's mysteries.\"\nDana Timmer, a pilot and four-time America\u2019s Cup sailor, is one of many people still fascinated by Earhart\u2019s disappearance. Timmer, who led a $1 million deep-sea search for the plane in 1999, believes Earhart\u2019s twin-engined Lockheed Electra has already been found \u2014 researchers just didn\u2019t realize it. He\u2019s asking for nearly $2 million on Kickstarter to prove his theory right.\nExplorer Dana Timmer is asking for $2 million\nAmelia Earhart theories fall into three camps: the Howland Island theory, the Gardner Island theory, and the conspiracy theories, which range from Earhart being captured by the Japanese to living the rest of her life out secretly in New Jersey .  Timmer is in the Howland Island camp, which holds that Earhart and Noonan crashed very close to their destination. After cross-referencing data from different groups that attempted searches in that area, his team has identified four targets \u2014 anomalies on the ocean floor that look like blobs of pixels on the sonar scan. Now he wants to go back with high-resolution sonar and photographic equipment to prove that one of these masses is the Electra.\nThe sonar scans that Timmer says show four anomalies that could be the plane.\nThe expedition will be managed by Williamson and Associates, a company that conducts deep-sea surveys and has discovered a number of historic shipwrecks for clients ranging from the Discovery Channel to the US Navy. The plan is to depart from Samoa on the Sarsen, a survey vessel capable of being deployed for 40 days without refueling, and sail for five days to Howland Island with a team of documentarians and researchers. They\u2019ll investigate the targets up close; if they don\u2019t find the plane, they\u2019ll scan as much of the area as they can.\nThey\u2019re promising to update Kickstarter backers with daily progress reports and a live video feed, culminating in a documentary film about the expedition. \"You'll get a rare and inside close-up look at what it takes to search for objects below in up to 18,000 feet of water; with interviews of the project team and crew members, as well as opportunities to have your questions answered,\" Timmer says in his Kickstarter pitch.\nThe team promises to update backers with progress reports and live video\nIf he finds the Electra, Timmer plans to only take photo and video. Then, he\u2019ll raise more money to retrieve, conserve, and display it. Earhart and Noonan\u2019s remains have likely disintegrated, but the plane may be fairly well-preserved. Extracting the wreckage will be a challenge, however; aluminum corrodes immediately when hit by oxygen, and the researchers have no idea how many pieces the plane will be in. (Timmer claims Earhart\u2019s niece Amy Kleppner has given him the rights to the Electra; this claim could not be verified by press time, but managers of the estate said there are communications going back 12 years.) Eventually, Timmer hopes to donate whatever he finds to the Smithsonian Institution.\nThere is no guarantee that Timmer is right, but there is good reason to think the plane went down near Howland Island. In her last transmissions, Earhart said they were close but running out of fuel. Her radio signal was strong enough that one of the radio operators on the US Coast Guard ship Itasca, which was waiting for them to refuel, walked out on deck to see if he could spot them.\nThere is disagreement even within the Howland Island camp, however. Researchers Elgen Long and Gary LaPook each have their own theories of Earhart\u2019s trajectory that conflict with Timmer\u2019s.\n\"We all have her near the island, we just have her coming into the island in a different way,\" Timmer says. He\u2019d like to have Long and LaPook along if he gets funded, however. \"I would invite them to join the expedition,\" he says. \"Then just go out and finally do this thing and find that plane and solve that mystery.\"\nTimmer cross-referenced sonar from different expeditions and found four targets\nThe competing Gardner Island theory, held by Ric Gillepsie of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), says that Earhart and Noonan ended up about 400 miles south of Howland island on Gardner Island, now part of the nation of Kiribati. TIGHAR has made repeated expeditions to the island, retrieving artifacts it claims are from Earhart\u2019s plane. The group is planning a $3 million expedition in September for which it is alsoÂ  fundraising .\nTimmer hopes to leave shortly after the Kickstarter is funded. As of this writing, the campaign had raised $10,606 of its $1,960,000 goal with 31 days to go.\nBrian Dunning, a science writer who runs Skeptoid.com and is a fierce critic of TIGHAR , believes Timmer has the right strategy. \"The Electra is a very small target in a very large expanse of very deep water,\" he says in an email. \"If Earhart's plane is ever going to be found, it's going to be found by a science-based group like Expedition Amelia, and not by a group like TIGHAR interested only in selling a sensational story to TV networks without regard to facts.\"\nTom Crouch, a senior curator at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, says he wouldn\u2019t want to place a bet one way or the other. Earhart\u2019s maps turned out to be inaccurate, the weather was foggier than expected, and no one knows what kind of winds she was dealing with. But \"if somebody holds a gun to my head and says, \u2018Where do you think they are, Amelia and Fred,\u2019\" he tells The Verge, \"I would say I think they\u2019re 18,000 feet down in the bottom of the Pacific, not all that far from Howland Island.\"\n\"Amelia Earhart is still our favorite missing person.\"\nEarhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, after which she became a celebrity and role model for women. She was a co-founder of The Ninety-Nines, a female pilot group, and promoted women\u2019s causes and the development of commercial air travel as an editor for Cosmopolitan, a vice president at National Airways, and various other venues.\n\"After all these years, Amelia Earhart is still our favorite missing person,\" Crouch says. \"She was one of the best-known women in the nation, in the world. Personally, I kind of like the fact that Amelia disappeared, because it\u2019s kept the memory of this really wonderful human being alive, generation after generation.\"\n","Title":"This man is asking for $2 million on Kickstarter to find Amelia Earhart\u2019s plane | The Verge","Tags":["culture","report","us-world"]}
