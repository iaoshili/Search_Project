{"Main text":"I was first in line for the world premiere of Furious 7\nRide or die\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn the world of the Fast & the Furious franchise, a few rules apply. Family comes first. You ride or die. And you willingly throw yourself into a multi-part film series that is some bonkers combination of superhero car fantasy and family melodrama.\nSo when SXSW announced Sunday morning that it was debuting Furious 7 at a secret midnight screening, there was no hesitation. There was no second-guessing of what I should do. There was simply the instantaneous decision to head down to the Paramount Theater to get in line. To see the film\u2026 no matter what it took.\nRide or die.\nIt was a journey. An adventure with ups and downs and twists and turns that ended with me in the theater for the first public screening of the film in the entire world, surrounded by hyped superfans that applauded, laughed, and cheered through every reveal, explosion, and gravity-defying stunt.\nIt was the perfect place to take one last ride.\n(From left to right: Tyrese Gibson, producer Neil Moritz, writer Chris Morgan, and director James Wan.)\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
