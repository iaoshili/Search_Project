{"Main text":"You can't bring a selfie stick to Coachella or Lollapalooza\nTo be fair, narcissists are also banned\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you're going to a music festival this summer, it might be difficult to fit your group's flower crowns into a single selfie.  Coachella and  Lollapalooza have  officially banned selfie sticks . Lollapalooza also bans \"narsisstics,\" which is either a typo or a bad pun.\nThis is probably because selfie sticks are annoying. You know there are people who will hoist them into the air in the middle of a set, blind to the fact that the people behind them are trying to watch DJ Snake or whatever. This is why umbrellas are the worst thing about outdoor shows. It's just rain you guys! Thankfully, umbrellas are also banned.\nThere you have it: no selfie sticks, just mud and bass drops.
