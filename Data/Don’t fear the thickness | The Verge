{"Main text":"Don\u2019t fear the thickness\nSmartphones need to get over their size insecurities\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMeaningful innovation is the tech industry\u2019s favorite aspiration. Technology shouldn\u2019t be built for its own sake, every company tells us, and must have a purpose that directly addresses the needs of its users. This ambition of purposive design has often been trampled over, however, in the blind pursuit of thinness. As with the megapixel wars of yesteryear, the race to have the thinnest phone has become an exercise in spec sheet obsession. Let\u2019s shave a few millimeters here and cut a couple of corners there and we too can live in the sub-7mm club.\nI think it\u2019s time we let go of this chronic size insecurity. It\u2019s okay to be thick. The best-loved designs over the history of smartphones have rarely been the thinnest. Whether it\u2019s the Motorola Droid (13.7mm), the Palm Pre (16.9mm), the BlackBerry Bold (10.5mm), the original iPhone (11.6mm), or the Nokia N9 (12.1mm), the classics of the past decade seem decidedly chubby when judged by modern standards. But who\u2019s setting these standards and why?\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I know thinner is generally better. Flat LCD screens have revolutionized the concept of the TV from a massive tube to a thing you can hang on your wall. The latest ThinkPads and iMacs are exponentially more portable and desirable than their original models and we\u2019re all benefitting from that. But the threshold of \"thin enough\" for phones was passed long ago. The girth difference between the pillowy N9 and its 8.7mm-thick design descendant, the Lumia 730, is not a meaningful one. Both phones are a pleasure to hold.\nThis would all be quite innocuous if thinness was just an extra layer of custard smothered atop your technology cake, but it all too often comes at a price. Small batteries and compromised cameras are the first victims of the desire for a thinner phone. Or, if the camera doesn\u2019t stink, it\u2019s because it actually protrudes out from the phone\u2019s body, as you\u2019ll find in Samsung\u2019s 6.7mm Galaxy Alpha and Apple\u2019s new iPhones , both hovering at just around 7mm. I\u2019ll let you in on a carefully guarded secret: there\u2019s no real difference between 7mm and 10mm, let alone between 6.7mm and 6.9mm. If only Samsung and Apple could have let their belts out a little, we could now be looking at devices with more cohesive, bulge-free designs and potentially more generous batteries to boot. And let\u2019s face it, an iPhone 6 Plus that was a little thicker on aluminum might not have had to deal with the present controversy about how bendy it is .\nIt\u2019s been two years since Nokia\u2019s chief industrial designer told me that \" thinness isn\u2019t everything .\" It\u2019s also been a few months since LG\u2019s lead designer told me that the G3 is thicker than it absolutely needed to be in order to achieve a better fit in the hand. Phone designers get it. I just wonder if phone marketers understand this as well: the slickest looking device may get you more sales today, but the one that feels best will be the foundation of your customer loyalty for the future.\nSpecs matter \u2014 and thinness is a great measuring stick for the continuing miniaturization of technology \u2014 but they matter in stages. Phone thinness hasn\u2019t been an important factor since the Motorola Razr put everyone\u2019s devices on a diet. There\u2019s a reasonable range of expectations that\u2019s now established, and while you can\u2019t stray too far outside it, the route to being meaningfully innovative really doesn\u2019t require you to be at the cutting edge, either. Everyone should move forward the way Motorola did with the Razr Maxx, which wasn\u2019t shy about bulking up to maximize its battery life. Sometimes, good things come in thick packages.\n","Title":"Don\u2019t fear the thickness | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","editorial","tldr","design","tech"]}
