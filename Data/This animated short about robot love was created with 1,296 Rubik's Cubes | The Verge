{"Main text":"This animated short about robot love was created with 1,296 Rubik's Cubes\nLove at first bleep\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI think there's a trick to solving Rubik's Cubes. You don't have to be a brainiac; you just have to have a good memory. Two to the left, one up, one right, two down... it's something like that, depending on the position of the color swatches. Anyway,Â YouTube user Joe Penna solved 1,296 mini Rubik's Cubes 961 times and turned it into a video of a robot love story. Jeff Schweikart did the animation.\nThe plot of the video is simple enough: a robot travels to another planet, where he meets his robot love, and they presumably live happily ever after. I had a hard time paying attention to the plot though, because I was trying to figure out the Rubik's Cube mechanics. One thing's for sure: this took a long time and a lot of patience to make.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
