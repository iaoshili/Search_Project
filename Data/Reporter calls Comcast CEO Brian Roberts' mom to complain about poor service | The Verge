{"Main text":"Reporter calls Comcast CEO Brian Roberts' mom to complain about poor service\nAnd it worked. Because moms get shit done.\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nComcast has created a  nation full of haters with its consistently poor customer service and general awfulness.  More people like BP than Comcast . Let that sink in. But Philadelphia Daily News columnist Ronnie Polaneczky had enough of Comcast, after getting a number of emails from a number of customers who received horrible treatment from the company, and decided to call the head honcho of the company, who could actually get something done. No, not Comcast CEO Brian Roberts,  Polaneczky called his 92-year-old mother . This actually happened.\nAfter Diana and Jason Airoldi told Polaneczky how they couldn't get their Comcast internet and cable hooked up for six weeks because of broken appointments by the company, she decided to skip right over Brian Roberts and go straight to his mom. The next day Comcast trucks showed up at the Airoldi's house, and finally set up their service. Because no matter your age or your position in a giant company that most people hate, you still have to listen to mom.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
