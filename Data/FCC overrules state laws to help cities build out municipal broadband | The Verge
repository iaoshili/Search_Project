{"Main text":"FCC overrules state laws to help cities build out municipal broadband\n3-2 vote gives local broadband an important victory\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBefore it tackles net neutrality, the FCC is setting a major precedent for municipal broadband: it's just voted to preempt state laws that were preventing two cities from building out their own locally run broadband networks. The decision was prompted by separate petitions from Wilson, North Carolina, and Chattanooga, Tennessee \u2014 both cities that've established high-speed, gigabit internet services, but have been barred from expanding to neighboring communities due to existing state laws. So far, 19 states have similar regulations to those that the FCC is overriding in Wilson and Chattanooga, but today's ruling affects only those two specific cases.\nThe vote affects only two states, but sets a huge precedent\nEven so, the FCC's 3-2 vote will serve as a landmark moment that other communities will point to as they try to compete against commercial ISPs and knock down those deeply restrictive state laws. \"There are a few irrefutable truths about broadband,\" said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler ahead of the vote. \"One is you can\u2019t say you\u2019re for broadband, and then turn around and endorse limits.\" The commission has decided that Tennessee and North Carolina are needlessly preventing the \"reasonable and timely deployment of high-speed internet access to all Americans,\" a senior FCC official said during a press call a few weeks ago. It's not hard to see the exact same logic being applied elsewhere when other petitions are brought forward.\n\"You can\u2019t say you\u2019re for broadband, and then turn around and endorse limits.\"\nIf you're wondering where the FCC gets power to make these decisions, it's claiming that states are getting in the way of its authority \u2014 granted under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act \u2014 to promote the deployment of broadband across the US. Here's how the FCC justified today's action in a press release that followed the successful vote:\nUnder federal law, a federal agency may preempt state laws that conflict with its regulations or policies so long as it is acting within the scope of its authority.  There is a clear conflict, the Order finds, between Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which directs the FCC to take action to remove barriers to broadband investment and competition, and provisions of the Tennessee and North Carolina law that erect barriers to expansion of service into surrounding communities, including unserved and underserved areas.\nUnsurprisingly, the cable establishment and entrenched ISPs have lobbied against this becoming a trend, with the opposition (and dissenting commissioners) trying to frame it as an aggressive overreach of the FCC's authority. \"We don\u2019t take lightly the matter of preempting state laws,\" admitted Wheeler. But the chairman made clear this was a situation in which the FCC saw no other choice but to act. \"The human faces of those who are condemned to second-rate broadband are a message to all of us.\"\n","Title":"FCC overrules state laws to help cities build out municipal broadband | The Verge","Tags":["policy","breaking","us-world","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7742856"]}
