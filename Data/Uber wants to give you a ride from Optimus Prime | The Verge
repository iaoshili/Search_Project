{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber is adding an impressive new vehicle to its fleet: the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime. As a promotion for the  upcoming Transformers: Age of Extinction , Uber will be offering users in Dallas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles a chance to ride in the iconic fire-clad truck. Prime will be in each city for a six-hour-long window, during which time you can simply choose the \"autobots\" option on the Uber app when requesting a pickup \u2014 though rides will be limited to just 15 minutes long. \"There's only one Optimus Prime,\" says Uber, \"so making contact will be difficult and may take many tries.\"\nWith Age of Extinction due to hit theaters on June 27th, it seems that the film's promotion is in full swing. Just yesterday a new  Transformers-themed version of Angry Birds was announced. As for Uber, this isn't the first time the company has partnered for a promotional ride service. Last week at  E3 in Los Angeles , attendees were able to grab a ride in  a Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare-themed armored personnel carrier . That promotion featured perks like letting riders check out new trailers for the game and ride alongside the developers, but it doesn't look like the Transformers ride will feature similar options \u2014 and a ride in Optimus Prime wouldn't really be complete without Peter Cullen yelling \"roll out!\"\n","Title":"Uber wants to give you a ride from Optimus Prime | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
