{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMany people believe the Republican Party has a fairly good shot of taking back the US Senate this November. But to help advance that cause, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) \u2014 or one of its interns, probably \u2014 just launched  a new game called Mission Majority . You play as Giopi (get it?), a pixelated elephant who looks like he belongs in the good 'ole 16-bit era, but is instead doing his best to persevere in a modern world.\nGiopi says he's a hopeful GOP volunteer just trying to cut through the \"red tape and regulations\" standing between Republicans and a Senate majority that would help the right push its legislative agenda. Throughout the run-and-jump platformer, you'll have to overcome \"job-destroying taxers\" and other foes who represent President Obama, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, and basically everything Democrats stand for.\nSadly we couldn't try the game firsthand. We gave it a valiant effort, but Giopi's adventure is totally broken. Once you sign in with Facebook, Google+, or your email account (prepare for endless GOP email blasts leading to the midterms this fall), Mission Majority just kind of stalls and sits there like this:\nWhoops. Software engineer \/ artist Cole Ott  has one theory on what's so wrong with the GOP's web browser game.\n\u2026is, it seems, that they're ignoring problems caused by [I kid you not] Race Conditions\n\u2014 Cole Ott (@coleott) August 27, 2014\n(for real. if you have a null pointer on page-load, there's a good chance it's a problem with race conditions. I died when I saw that)\n\u2014 Cole Ott (@coleott) August 27, 2014\nSo it would seem the Republican Party isn't very good at making video games.  Advertising in popular games young people actually play might be a better idea. Then again, the  White House has come up short on much more important web-related projects, so maybe everybody loses. It doesn't matter anyway, since Mission Majority is little more than a cute attempt to round up email addresses so the NRSC can fill up your inbox with its talking points. Good luck with that, Giopi.\n","Title":"Republicans hope this elephant and a busted video game will help 'win back the Senate' | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","us-world"]}
