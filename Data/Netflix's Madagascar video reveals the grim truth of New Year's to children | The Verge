{"Main text":"Netflix's Madagascar video reveals the grim truth of New Year's to children\n\"Happy new year \u2014 it's a year that's new!\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nParents, if you want to expose your kids to the spectacle of New Year's Eve, consider  this Madagascar short from Netflix a very, very concentrated dose.\nIn just 3 minutes and 15 seconds, \"King Julien New Year's Eve Countdown\" (tied to the new Netflix kids series All Hail King Julien) manages to teach children about grownup New Year's Eve in a way that's both fun on the surface but awkward when you take a step back and think about it just a little too much. There's the dance music that hits every 2014 music trope over a thumping 4\/4 bass \u2014 with lyrics that are contractually obligated to say \"party\" three times each minute and promises that \"tonight will be forever.\" To that, there's the crowds of people awkwardly shuffling about in rhythm. There's the inexplicable flashing lights... where are they coming from, anyway?\nOh, and that one guy wearing the funny hat acting like he's the crowned king of parties? The one doing all the awkward pelvic thrusting and shouting the countdown louder than anyone else? He's there, too \u2014 and for poetic justice, we get his \"hangover pose\" in the last frame of the short:\nKids, this could be you in a decade or two.\nIf nothing else, it's a chance to try and lie to your kids about what time New Year's Eve actually is \u2014 provided you change or remove all other time-telling hardware in the house and the child doesn't grasp how Netflix actually works.\n","Title":"Netflix's Madagascar video reveals the grim truth of New Year's to children | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","watch-this","entertainment"]}
