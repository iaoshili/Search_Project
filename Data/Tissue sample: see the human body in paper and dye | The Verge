In her latest show, \" Connective Tissue ,\" the artist takes the increasingly common image of an MRI-like cross-section of a human body and recreates it with swirls of tightly wound paper under glass. Most of the images come from the Visible Human project , a research database maintained by the National Library of Medicine, along with some 19th century medical texts \u2014 so everything you see here is anatomically accurate, and each body once belonged to a living person.\nThe technique is called quilling, an old method for turning small strips of paper into visually striking coils . Nilsson says the key is how the coiled paper flows into all the available space. \"Coils can conform to completely fill a space or cavity,\" Nilsson says, just like organs inside a body. The material itself is Japanese mulberry paper, mixed like paint to get the perfect color for each body part, ranging from pink-gray brain to deep-red muscle. The result feels both fleshy and surreal, a combination of dainty craft and the messiness of the human machine.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nFor anatomical work, Nilsson limits herself to 12 different colors, introducing other tones only sparingly.\nThe show combines flat specimen-style boxes with standing cameos.\nNilsson was inspired by early anatomy photographs from Christian Braune and Eug√®ne-Louis Doyen.\nThis piece shows a human torso in cross-section.\nThe pink of the brain is actually a combination of pink, ivory, and tan paper, to get what Nilsson calls \"that fleshy not-quite-pink.\"\nFat deposits are represented by tight coils of yellow-tan paper.\nTo cover the glass boxes, Nilsson repurposed old hardcover book binding.\nLarger muscle structures get more intricate shading, moving between light pinks and deeper wine-tinged reds.\n","Title":"Tissue sample: see the human body in paper and dye | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
