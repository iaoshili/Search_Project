{"Main text":"It just got way easier to embed Facebook videos on the web\nSupport for 360-degree videos comes to the newsfeed\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFacebook is taking an important step today that could go a long way toward supporting its ambitions in video: allowing videos on its platform to be embedded across the web. Previously, Facebook videos could kind-of-sort-of be embedded elsewhere, but it was never a pretty sight. Facebook has now added an easy way for you to grab an embed code, placing it in a menu at the bottom of the video. That video will also show up in a new \u2014 and functional \u2014 player.\nThe video-hosting features that Facebook offers have never really been competitive with YouTube, but with the right work, they could be. Facebook has been going after advertisers and publishers in a big way lately, and adding support for embeds \u2014 which allow videos to spread off-platform \u2014 is a critical step toward building its video presence.

These videos allow viewers to look around the world in all directions while the video is playing. While they're interesting to view on a computer, the real excitement lies in virtual reality. Watch a 360-degree video on the Oculus Rift, which Facebook owns, and you'd be able to naturally look around at the filmed world.\nYouTube very recently started supporting 360-degree videos as well. Facebook's support could be viewed as a challenge, but it's arguably more of a necessity. If it wants the Oculus Rift to take off, it's going to have to give people a reason to want to buy one \u2014 and 360-degree video, at the very least, is a reason. Here's what a 360-degree video currently looks like on YouTube (you can change your view by dragging around or using the controls in the corner):\n","Title":"It just got way easier to embed Facebook videos on the web | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
