{"Main text":"Sleep Number's newest smart bed will track your kids' slumber\nIt knows when you are sleeping. It knows when you're awake\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe internet of beds is upon us \u2014 and it's coming for your kids.  Sleep Number , famous for its mattresses with adjustable air pockets, is making a version of its cloud-connected beds for children.  The SleepIQ Kids bed , which the company announced today, monitors your children's slumber and will alert you when they get out of bed. Lights under the bed help guide children when they get up in the middle of the night, and a \"monster detector\" reassures children that no bad guys are lurking down there.\nThe kids version of the bed comes  a year after the X12 , which introduced the SleepIQ tracking feature. SleepIQ data can be viewed on companion apps for smartphones and tablets and is never shared publicly, the company says. In addition to recording how long you've slept, the apps also offer suggestions for improvement \u2014 something the company says will be particularly useful for four- to six-year-olds, who are still establishing their sleeping routines.\nDepending on your point of view, there can be something a little creepy about a bed that sends an alert every time you step out of it. But if you're a parent, it could also bring some peace of mind. You can learn more about the SleepIQ Kids bed, including where to buy it,  right here .\n","Title":"Sleep Number's newest smart bed will track your kids' slumber | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech","ces-2015"]}
