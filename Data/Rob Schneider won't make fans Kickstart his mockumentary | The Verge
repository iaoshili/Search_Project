{"Main text":"Rob Schneider won't make fans Kickstart his mockumentary\nComedian is spending \"beyond seven figures\" of his own money on show\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDeuce Bigalow's Rob Schneider is making an eight-episode television show described as \"an exaggerated version of his real life\" even though it hasn't been pitched to network executives yet. The Los Angeles Times writes the comedian is spending more than $1 million on the sitcom, which he is producing despite strenuous warnings from his agency and advisors, who the star says questioned his sanity. Schneider also rejected the idea of Kickstarter, which celebrities like Zach Braff have used to fund personal projects. He explains his fans were already \"paying for this\" through their patronage of his other shows and movies.\nCo-created by Schneider and his wife, Real Rob is being filmed mockumentary-style with a single camera, and will see the actor and his partner playing themselves. The sitcom will include references to the Saturday Night Live alumnus' life, including his experiences with CBS and his doomed, semi-autobiographical comedy Rob. Most of the hour-long episodes are being shot either around Los Angeles or at Full Sail University, Florida. Production is scheduled to finish in October. According to theÂ Los Angeles Times, there are plans to sell Real Rob abroad, where American content is reportedly in high demand.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
