{"Main text":"Despite reports, no one tried to use Siri to hide a body\nMurder suspect's iPhone was an iPhone 4, which did not have the virtual assistant\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEarlier today, it seemed that someone may have actually asked Siri  how to hide a body , and meant it.  The Independent reported that 20-year-old murder suspect Pedro Bravo had told his iPhone, \"I need to my hide my roommate.\" He allegedly committed the crime following an argument with Christian Aguilar, who was dating Bravo's ex-girlfriend. But Bravo's attorney  is disputing those events , saying Bravo's phone only had the picture saved on his device, and didn't necessarily perform the search. What's more, it appears Bravo owned an iPhone 4, not a 4S, the version where Siri first appeared.\nUS authorities said they discovered location data contradicting the suspect's testimony in regards to his location during the time of the incident. Additionally, it was determined that Bravo used his phone's flash light nine times. The Independent cites police as saying Bravo used the function while attempting to conceal the deceased's body.\nIn the past, Siri  provided suggestions as to where to deposit a corpse , although that recently changed to something more evasive.\nUpdate: This post has been rewritten to include new information on the case, including the type of phone the suspect owned.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
