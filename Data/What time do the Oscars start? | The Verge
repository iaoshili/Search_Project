But if you want the full red carpet experience, you'll want to tune in at 7PM ET\/4PM PT.\nDo you know of any good live blogs?\nIs Billy Crystal hosting this year?\nNo.\nNeil Patrick Harris.\nOh wow, I saw him as Hedwig on Broadway!\nWhat? So did I! He laid a big, mushy kiss on the guy right next to me, and I don't know why, but I was just so jealous. Not that I needed that kiss. I guess I just like attention and love from anyone and everyone.\nIs that why you're a writer?\nYes.\nSo who else will be at the Oscars?\nYou know, the usuals. Paltrow, Tatum, Kidman, Johansson...\nWill J. Lo be there?\nMhmm.\nYou know it! He's performing some tunes with Jennifer Hudson.\nHey, why hasn't Jack Black made a good movie in a while?\nHe has! A lot of people missed Bernie, which is a real shame. It was directed by Boyhood director and Oscar nominee Richard Linklater.\nI have to run, but one more quick question?\nHit me.\nI don't want to be rude.\nYou seem very nice, go ahead.\nDo you know how Crash won Best Picture in 2006?\nI have been asking myself the same thing for the last decade!\nRight? Like, that really caused me to lose faith in the entire institution. That and the recurring focus on old white men.\nHollywood, right!\nRight!\nCorrection: Crash won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2006, not 2004 as originally stated. The film, did, however, premiere in 2004.\nVerge Video from CES 2015: How I survived my first CES\n","Title":"What time do the Oscars start? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
