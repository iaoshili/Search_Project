{"Main text":"Bidder backs out of auction for rare 20th anniversary PlayStation 4\nSony will donate to charity instead\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month,  Sony auctioned off the very first model of its  beautiful, limited edition 20th anniversary PlayStation 4 , with the proceeds to be donated to the Save The Children Japan charity. And the move proved to be a huge success: the winning bidder offered ¥15,135,000, or about $129,000, for the rare console. Unfortunately, for reasons that are unclear, that person won't be able to pay for the PS4 after all, and instead Sony will keep the machine and donate the same amount to the charity. The rare PS4, meanwhile, will be on display at Sony's Ginza Showroom in Tokyo starting on February 21st, complete with its 00001 \/ 12300 badge.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
