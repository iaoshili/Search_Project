{"Main text":"The Rocky Horror Picture Show may be getting an unnecessary TV remake\nRemake, Schmemake, Janet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe internet can be a very cynical place. Empowered with the gift of anonymity \u2014 or at least an alternate identity somewhat removed from reality \u2014 it's easier to give into snarky one-liners vs. earnest thoughts on a subject. Sometimes things aren't really as bad as they seem.\nWith all that said, I can't help but feel pain at the thought of a Rocky Horror Picture Show remake.  But alas, it seems to be happening.\nThe new two-hour television special, tentatively titled The Rocky Horror Picture Show Event according to Deadline , will be produced by Fox 21 TV studios and is reportedly expected to stay faithful to the original script and score \"but greatly reimagine the story visually.\" The movie will be directed and choreographed by Kenny Ortega (High School Musical, Hocus Pocus, Michael Jackson's This Is It).\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show premiered August 14th, 1975, which means we're nearing the 40th anniversary of a definitive cult classic. No casting news yet, but if you ask us, the only person that could replace 28-year-old Tim Curry as Dr. Frank-N-Furter is... you guessed it... 68-year-old Tim Curry.\nMake it happen, Kenny.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
