{"Main text":"131 Comments\nDr. Carlos Wesley cues up some Carole King on his laptop and positions a head squarely in front of him. It\u2019s been thawing for 24 hours, ever since arriving by UPS from a cadaver lab in Arizona that sells bodies donated to science. It\u2019s now tender and looks frostbitten, with hair buzzed to a gray stubble.\n\u201CThis was a 59-year-old woman,\u201D says Dr. Wesley, looking down at the head. \u201CI don\u2019t know what the cause of death was, it should say somewhere on the box.\u201D That box is only big enough to fit a head and packing materials: unlike most scientists and surgeons, Wesley isn\u2019t interested in a cadaver\u2019s internal organs or ligaments and bones. He\u2019s only interested in the scalp.\nIt\u2019s two in the afternoon, and a cloudless sky is beaming down over the Rocky Mountains south of Salt Lake City, Utah. Inside the sparse laboratory, the doctor\u2019s blue scrubs are the only color amid the dull gleam of stainless steel tables. The air is odorless and artificially chilled. A Kevlar poster that reads \u201CCoorsTek\u201D \u2014 the name of the medical-device company whose lab we\u2019re using for the day \u2014 has been hastily affixed to the wall prior to my arrival, for branding purposes.\nAs footloose folk-pop melodies fill the room, Wesley extends two fingers towards a small incision in the cadaver\u2019s head and gently lifts a flap of skin. With his other hand, he picks up the piloscope, the invention he\u2019s here to test: the device looks like a piece of AV equipment, a cross between a mic stand and a camera, with an Xbox-style controller of metal knobs and gears. He inserts its rodlike arm several inches into the cadaver\u2019s scalp through the incision, and taps his foot on an attached floor pedal, like a sewing machine. A motor, located on the table beside him, makes a whirring sound.\nAfter 10 minutes of intermittent whirring, Wesley lays down the device and unscrews the top of a closed Petri dish connected to the machine with a rubber tube. Pink, larval-looking hair follicles, sucked from inside the cadaver\u2019s scalp, bob in saline solution. Wesley examines the specimens closely and looks up, triumphant. \u201CThese,\u201D he exhorts, \u201Care the shape we want!\u201D\nA highly regarded hair-restoration surgeon based in Manhattan, Wesley travels several times a year to Utah to spend a few days in the CoorsTek lab. There, he tests and tinkers with his piloscope, a device that\u2019s consumed much of his attention (and financial resources) over the past five years. It\u2019s the first-ever tool that can remove hair follicles from underneath a human scalp (pilo is Latin for hair). Wesley hopes that his creation catalyzes a new era of hair-transplant surgery, one devoid of the scarring that characterizes existing procedures.\nThat might seem like an incremental, unremarkable improvement, but it isn\u2019t. Any step towards regaining a fuller head of hair without the evidence of scars, to the patients Wesley sees, is a monumental one. His calendar is filled with men coming to his office right after a breakup, their eyes bloodshot from sleepless nights scrolling through online forums like Hair Loss Help and Bald Truth Talk. They\u2019ve become convinced that the way to restore a bruised ego and a broken heart (and maybe get a few dates) is by replacing lost hair.\n\"There\u2019s no such thing as a hair emergency, but often times they make it seem like there is,\" says Wesley, 39, whose 6-foot frame, playful smile, and (yes) healthy crop of brown hair make him look less like a doctor than an actor playing one on TV. \"Oftentimes,\" he says of his patients, \"it\u2019s clear a psychiatrist would be more effective.\"\n\"There\u2019s no such thing as a hair emergency.\"\nWesley\u2019s been doing hair transplants since graduating from Yale\u2019s medical school nine years ago. After volunteering in Latin America as an undergraduate at Princeton, he\u2019d originally wanted a job in the ER treating immigrant populations. But while working on his med-school thesis, Wesley came across research on hair follicle stem cells by a renowned New York hair surgeon named Dr. Walter Unger. After the two became friendly, Unger invited him to observe a few hair transplants. That turned into an apprenticeship, and Wesley found that he enjoyed the field\u2019s relaxed pace and close relationships \u2014 doctors often spend all day with a single patient, and work with them over months and even years. He opened his own practice in 2007.\nThe Park Avenue office where Wesley sees patients is small and utilitarian. His diplomas hang on one wall, and a framed picture of Wesley dipping his wife, Anna, at their recent Malibu wedding sits on the bookshelf behind his desk. It\u2019s here that Wesley spends hours doing consultations, trying to convey the benefits and limitations of existing hair-restoration options. Have patients tried Toppik, colored fibers you sprinkle over your bald spot? Or Propecia, a pill that stops balding in up to 88 percent of men? Maybe Rogaine, a topical foam applied twice a day to slow hair loss? Hair transplants, he tells them, can offer robust results in some patients \u2014 but can sometimes be accompanied by significant downsides. \"You have to get them to see, is the benefit better than the risk?\" Wesley says.\nBy 35, seven out of ten men will be losing significant amounts of hair (40 percent of women experience thinning too, but fewer go bald enough to consider surgery). Despite those statistics, hair transplants remain relatively unpopular: no one tracks the procedures exhaustively, but surveys suggest they trail behind nose jobs, breast implants, and liposuction, three of the most popular cosmetic surgeries.\nIn part, that\u2019s because hair transplants never recovered in reputation after decades of so-so results. During the 1970s and 1980s, doctors grafted \"plugs\" of hair follicles from the back of the head to bald areas. The result often resembled doll hair: round clumps with spaces of scalp in between. By the 1990s, doctors were able to transplant individual hair follicles, achieving a more natural look. But to pull that off, they had to take a long strip of scalp from the back of the head to provide \"donor\" follicles, leaving patients with a swooping scar from ear to ear.\nDoctors today still rely on that method, but some also use a technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUE involves removing follicles, one by one, using a tiny punch, and then transplanting them. The procedure doesn\u2019t create one big scar, but it does create tiny, permanent white scars that can widen, and look noticeable enough that some men fill them in with tattoos. The small punches used for FUE can also strip follicles of protective tissue, meaning some portion of the transplant might fail entirely.\nThose shortcomings leave a hole that hair transplant specialists are eager to fill, and they\u2019ve got no shortage of ideas. At last year\u2019s annual conference of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS), surgeons buzzed about a new robotic FUE machine called ARTAS and debated the merits of transplanting beard hair onto human heads. Another surgeon, Peter Panagotacos, told me that he\u2019d successfully grafted pubic hair onto a patient\u2019s scalp. And various doctors, including Wesley, are experimenting with a regenerative powder derived from pig bladder.\nAll of these developments are tracked eagerly on online hair-loss forums, where hundreds of people share news, recount details of their own hair-hacking regimens, and chronicle the shame and anxiety that can accompany both baldness and its existing surgical solutions. \"Should have been slick bald by 26\u2026if not for thinking outside the box and experimenting,\" writes \"Stevo\" on Hair Loss Help, listing some 30 tactics and treatments he currently undergoes (among them is \"Indian needling,\" a process whereby one rolls a needle-embedded brush over the scalp). \"I had a bigger scar than I expected,\" admitted another user, \"Varonil.\" He adds that he considered shaving his head, but didn\u2019t want to expose that he\u2019d undergone surgery for baldness, \"like it was something so horrible that it merited disfiguring surgery.\"\nWesley\u2019s decision to enter his profession\u2019s world of maverick experimentation, his \"aha moment,\" he says, came in 2009. On his way home one evening, he was distracted by a subway ad with a picture of three bald heads. It was a shame, Wesley mused, that men who undergo hair surgery can\u2019t shave their heads because of the scars. He wondered: Why does there have to be scarring at all? Was it possible to go beneath the surface of the skin to take out the follicles, eliminating the side effect that so many men were ashamed of? His mother, an immigrant from Mexico who\u2019d grown up in a rough LA neighborhood before becoming a successful veterinarian, had always encouraged Wesley to take big risks. So when Wesley imagined what he might be able to do for his patients \u2014 restore their hair, and do it without the downsides \u2014 he became fixated on creating a device to accomplish just that.\nVarious doctors are experimenting with a regenerative powder derived from pig bladder\nWith Dr. Unger\u2019s encouragement, Wesley got a job working nights at his friend\u2019s wine shop, swapped frequent restaurant meals for a diet of homemade spaghetti, and put every extra penny towards bootstrapping the piloscope. He rented hysteroscopes, devices typically used to inspect uteri, because they were the \"most affordable\" existing tool with some similarities to his initial concept. From there, Wesley prodded around on cadavers (a practice that\u2019s actually routine when testing new medical devices) and determined that you could insert a device into a layer of tissue below hair follicles but above nerves and blood vessels. When he scraped together enough money, he hired freelance engineers to help craft early prototypes. Two years and $200,000 later, he\u2019d fashioned a crude device and was eager to try it on live scalps. By luring them with the promise of free FUE grafts, Wesley recruited five of his former patients and his brother-in-law to serve as guinea pigs in an experimental piloscopy session. That study showed that follicles extracted with Wesley\u2019s device grew 45 percent better than those transplanted using FUE. From there, Wesley secured $2 million in seed funding and partnered with CoorsTek to refine the device.\nAt the ISHRS conference in October, Wesley introduced the piloscope to fellow hair surgeons. Within days, online hair-loss forums lit up with people seeking more information. \"I heard from credible sources that Dr. Wesley\u2019s technique is \u2018amazing\u2019 BUT there are still some barriers,\" wrote a user named \"didi.\" \"I think if this was something really interesting, we would have heard something by now,\" replied \"Arashi.\" \"Be patient guys,\" advised \"Javert.\" \"Maybe something will leak soon!\"\nShortly after his presentation, Wesley was a guest on a popular podcast, The Bald Truth, where host Spencer Kobren mused that piloscopy \u2014 what Wesley calls the technique \u2014 may become the \"new gold standard\" in hair-transplant surgery. Over 1,000 people subsequently contacted Wesley to volunteer for his next clinical trial, which starts this month. Wesley plans to share the piloscope with a few of the industry\u2019s top surgeons by 2015, make adjustments based on their observations, then release it more widely. He hopes the piloscope will be freely available to hair doctors by early 2016.\nDespite the buzz, some doctors in the field still aren\u2019t convinced that Wesley\u2019s device will succeed. \"Those of us who\u2019ve been in scalps for a long time have lots of questions,\" says Dr. Carlos Puig, a Houston, Texas-based hair surgeon and former president of the ISHRS. He worries about surgical complications like hematoma (bruising) or other swelling that could lead to infection. And Dr. Jim Harris, a prominent hair transplant doctor near Denver, Colorado, is skeptical that surgeons will be able to access enough scalp from a single small incision, \"which means more than one incision will be required,\" he said in an email. \"This runs contrary to what the piloscope is all about.\"\nBut it\u2019s actually Wesley\u2019s mentor, Dr. Unger, who points out the piloscope\u2019s biggest drawback: it still isn\u2019t a perfect solution for patients who need a lot of hair transplanted. Much like FUE, piloscopy can only remove a limited number of follicles before it starts to create noticeable gaps in existing hair. \"Dr. Wesley\u2019s device,\" he says, \"will at least eliminate the production of scars.\"\nFor many men, that might be enough. \"I absolutely would have considered it,\" says one of Dr. Wesley\u2019s patients, a man who requested anonymity in part because he didn\u2019t want to draw attention to his thick, red scalp scar from an earlier procedure from a former doctor. \"That peace of mind is irreplaceable.\"\n\"Clearly, this matters to a lot of people.\"\nBack in the lab, Wesley grabs a fresh head to give me a side-by-side comparison of piloscopy and the standard FUE technique. He inserts the piloscope\u2019s arm through an incision in the scalp, and carefully clicks and maneuvers for 15 minutes before switching to the other side of the scalp to core out follicles using a FUE punch.\nWatching him concentrate, I wonder whether Wesley\u2019s work in this little corner of science is worth it. After all, he estimates that piloscopy may cost a patient upwards of $20,000 out of pocket, and it isn\u2019t exactly a life-saving procedure. Over dinner the night before, Wesley admitted he once pondered that question too \u2014 or at least worried that others were. When he first started in the field, his hands would shake and his face would turn red whenever people asked what he did. \"When you go to these fancy schools,\" he said, \"people expect you to go down a more traditional path.\" But over several years and hundreds of cases, Wesley found value in helping patients \"just get on with their lives,\" even if he wasn\u2019t saving them. \"Clearly,\" he told me, \"this matters to a lot of people.\"\nAfter more drilling on the cadaver\u2019s scalp, Wesley shows off the results for comparison. The side on which he\u2019s performed FUE looks like the surface of a Parmesan cheese grater. Even though circulation had long since stopped, blood has risen to the surface of the holes \u2014 glistening pinpricks that would, in a living body, gradually harden into scars. The side where the hair follicles have been removed by the piloscope looks entirely untouched \u2014 exactly as Wesley had intended. \"And that,\" he says, pulling off his goggles with a smile, \"was my equivalent of a fireworks show!\"\n","Title":"Sultan of scalp: one doctor peels back the skin to find a better cure for baldness | The Verge","Tags":["features","science","longform"]}
