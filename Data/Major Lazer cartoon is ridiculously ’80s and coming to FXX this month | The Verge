{"Main text":"Major Lazer cartoon is ridiculously \u201980s and coming to FXX this month\n'It's like being high.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDiplo's electronic music group, Major Lazer, has been in the process of turning their wild, \u201980s aesthetic into a cartoon for years, and this month it's finally ready to air. The show premieres April 16th at midnight as part of FXX's block of animated shorts. The final result, as shown in a number of clips on YouTube, is a deeply \u201980s cartoon with bright colors, goofy characters, and a ton of amazing guest stars, including J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Aziz Ansari, Charli XCX, Riff Raff, and Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, known for playing Mr. Eko on Lost, voices Major Lazer, a Jamaican superhero with a laser gun for a forearm. Akinnuoye-Agbaje describes watching the series as \"like being high.\"\nDiplo, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and a number of other guest stars and series creators discuss the show in a video FXX posted last week. Watch it \u2014 it looks ridiculous in all the right ways:\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
