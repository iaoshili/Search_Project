{"Main text":"The Tumbler had guns. The Batmobile and the Bat Wing from Batman: The Animated Series also had weapons in them as well and that series is widely regarded as one of the greatest Batman shows ever made.\nAll of Batman's vehicles have weapons, this isn't new.\nRedForty\n1. This writer has pretty close to zero knowledge of Batman canon if he thinks a Batmobile with guns mounted on it is even a thing deserving any analysis. There is zero story here.\n2. I prefer a sleeker Batmobile but this is Batman v. Superman. That \"v\" stands for versus. Superman is a fucking invincible god. I would expect Bats to break out the heavy artillery for a rogue Supes. Do you even Dark Knight Returns, bro? Seriously.\n3. Now does the car look like a demonic rabbit a la Donnie Darko with the doors up? Maybe.\nAnd from Twitter:\n\u2014 Matt Saler (@mattsaler) September 11, 2014\nThey made Superman a murderer\u2014if they make Batman one too, what will they fight over, @plante ? It\u2019s The Bat\u2019s intervention w\/ Murder-Supes.\n\u2014 Matt Saler (@mattsaler) September 11, 2014\n@plante sorry, I know you\u2019re getting a lot of that. If they make it a gun & Batman an overt killer I\u2019ll be pissed\u2014But don\u2019t see it happening\n\u2014 Matt Saler (@mattsaler) September 11, 2014\nAnd from e-mail:\nJJ Odone\nHello,\nI'm not going to lie. I'm a bit of a nerd. A big Superman fan too so, as you could imagine, I loved Man of Steel. But I'm writing really because of two reasons:\n1) they won't let me post in the comments until tomorrow, at which time I will likely forget about this  and....\n2) because I am really disappointed in your lack of research that went into this article.\nI'm well aware you'll probably blow this email off, but I kind of hope you look at it as a reason to delve further into the backgrounds of subjects you decide to write about.\nThis article seems to attack two of the upcoming Batmobile appearances. The first in Batman v. Superman, the second in the upcoming Arkham Knight. I could see how someone would look at the turrets on either iteration of the batmobile and be skeptical of them, even with the disclaimer of rubber bullets attached, but I find it funny that you specifically note the \"mobility rather than lethality\" of Bat vehicles in the Nolan trilogy. It's as if you forget about the climax of Batman Begins where Sergent Gordon is in the tumbler and shooting explosive rounds at the train pillars. I believe those were the same cannons that the Batpod had in Dark Knight when Bats was blowing up parked cars to clear a path for himself, not to mention the machine guns he used to destroy glass doors so he could take the shortcut through a mall. And as for the Bat, Batman's urban flying machine, it's like you forget that he shot up the truck that carried the nuke which resulted directly to the driver's death and indirectly to Talia's.\nSpeaking of the Nolan trilogy, I defy you to watch that again. All three movies. And really pay attention. And as you're sitting there, count how many deaths Batman is actually responsible for. By my count he killed between 30 or 50 people.\nBut the Batmobile and all Bat vehicles have always had guns or light artillery on them, so why is it that you have such a problem with it now? Is it Zack Snyder? I know you said he uses death as \"emotional spice\". Sure, thousands of people died in Man of Steel. And yes, Zod did get his neck broken and Superman seemed very upset that he had to do that. But think of Superman II. When Superman comes out of that chamber and finally kneels before Zod only to break his hand and toss him into an icy crevice with a smile on his face. Personally, I think that's a much worse death than getting your neck snapped, but maybe Zod is hanging out with polar bears and chilling in a really nice igloo.\nThe point I'm trying to make is that Batman\/Superman\/anything nerdy really requires a bit more time and thought before you just go and post your opinion. I mean, unless this is a hobby, I'm sure you would like to be looked at as a serious journalist, not just another FOX news anchor who spouts out thoughtless diatribe. As I said before, I'm sure you'll ignore this. But on the off chance that you don't, it would be a shame if your lack of research on such a petty subject bled over into something that was much more serious.\nI hope you have a great day.\nEven\n","Title":"Why a gun belongs on the Batmobile: our reader feedback | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
