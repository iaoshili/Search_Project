Superman: Dawn of Justice, due out in 2016. While the rumors haven't yet been confirmed by Warner Bros.,  HitFix reports that Snyder has already finalized the designs for the character and shooting will ramp up soon.\nMomoa may be joining an already crowded cast of heroes\nRumors of Momoa joining Batman v. Superman's already crowded cast have circulated for months. Rumblings of his being in talks for the Aquaman role first surfacing late last year , but the actor has up to now always denied any attachment to the film. If the rumors hold up, however, he'll play one of the more venerable \u2014 if easily mocked \u2014 members of the Justice League, alongside the likes of Wonder Woman, Cyborg, and the movie's title characters.\nWhether or not Momoa does finally fill the role, Warner Bros. seems set on making Aquaman a viable live-action hero. Even though the character has enjoyed something of a renaissance in comics and in the DC animated universe in recent years, the last time a human being played the part was in a 2006 pilot for the CW network. That show was never picked up.\n","Title":"Jason Momoa rumored to play Aquaman in 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5505645"]}
