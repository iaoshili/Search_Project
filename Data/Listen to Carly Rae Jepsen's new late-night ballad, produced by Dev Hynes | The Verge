{"Main text":"Listen to Carly Rae Jepsen's new late-night ballad, produced by Dev Hynes\nA match made in pop heaven\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEver since Carly Rae Jepsen's sticky pop hit \"Call Me Maybe\" first came out, it was obvious she'd have a hard time shedding the song's  one-hit wonder potential . But last month, it finally seemed like she could be turning over a new song-leaf with the slightly less catchy but still super-sweet \" I Really Like You .\" Now, Jepsen has linked up with the NYC-based musician Dev Hynes (who works under the moniker  Blood Orange ) and, for my money, that was a great idea.\nThe song is called \"All That,\" and immediately it reminded me of Britney Spears' 1999 single \" Sometimes .\" The fluttering atmospherics, the whispered, almost childish vocals. And, really, the jump from Carly Rae to Britney is not that big. But Hynes' production stamp on this song is so, so clear. Listen to \"Chamakay\" off his excellent 2013 album  Cupid Deluxe :\nIt's lusty lounge music, tinged with an '80s aesthetic and tropical, hollow beats \u2014 a version of which we hear in \"All That.\" Hynes also produced Solange's biggest hit to date: 2012's \" Losing You ,\" which also had that stuttering, late-night sway about it.\nThe conclusion?
