{"Main text":"Yahoo Mail adds smart contact cards to your inbox\nThe feature is currently only available in the US\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYahoo Mail is adding new contact cards that can display glanceable information about your contacts without having to leave your inbox. Hovering over an name in an email will activate the smart contact cards, which automatically pull in photos, phone numbers, job titles, and links to Facebook and Twitter profiles (to see information from Facebook, you'll need to link your Facebook profile to your Yahoo Mail account). You can also search for emails from the person or company, or compose a new email directly from the contact card. The new contact cards are powered by technology from Xobni, whichÂ  Yahoo acquired back in 2013 . Yahoo says the contact cards will gradually roll out to desktop users in the US.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
