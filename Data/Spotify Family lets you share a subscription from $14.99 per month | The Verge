{"Main text":"Spotify Family lets you share a subscription from $14.99 per month\nAvailable worldwide in the coming weeks\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSpotify is finally letting subscribers share their accounts with family and friends. The streaming music service is unveiling Spotify Family today, a way to share a premium subscription with up to four other Spotify users. Pricing starts at $14.99 for two users per month, $19.99 for three, $24.99 for four, and all the way up to $29.99 for all five users. Spotify says the new plans will be made available globally in the coming weeks.\nWhile Spotify will share the premium subscription across all users, accounts will remain separate so that playlists and recommendations aren\u2019t mixed into a single shared account. A single premium subscription is currently priced at $9.99 per month, so the new family pricing works out at an extra $5 per user. It\u2019s a highly requested feature, and one that rivalÂ  Rdio has offered for more than a year now, albeit at a slightly higher cost.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
