{"Main text":"SXSW's creepy virtual sex talk is everything wrong with VR hype\nNever say 'sexual singularity' again\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVR developers are usually pretty positive about our present reality, even if the experiences they build are things that are difficult or impossible in real life. Nobody, for example, sells the ISS spacewalk simulator by saying Earth is for losers. \u201COh, you\u2019re not a 10-mouthed alien in a nightclub ? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201D\nSo it\u2019s... interesting, to say the least, that SXSW held a panel titled \u201CThe Future of Porn Is 3D Virtual Reality\u201D that hinged entirely on the idea that touching another human being, or paying attention to anything a woman does, is boring and horrible.\nBrian Shuster is the CEO of Utherverse, which produces the sex-focused Second Life alternative Red Light Center. He believes that over the past few years, RedTube-style video sites have transformed not just the porn industry, but the very way we view sex. A few minutes into the panel, he laid out his reasoning:\n\u201CBasically, you're looking at exactly the women you want to look at at that moment, and they're doing exactly the sex acts that people have compared to\u201D what you want, thanks to user curation. Then, after watching exceptionally desirable \u201Csexual athletes,\u201D you go back to a fumbling and less attractive partner. \u201CScrew that jazz! Porn is better than sex! I\u2019m in complete control, I\u2019m experiencing vicariously exactly what I want, and it's really great.\u201D\nIf you\u2019re at all familiar with evangelical Christian anti-porn arguments, this might seem pretty familiar. Here\u2019s how \"accountability and filtering\" software company Covenant Eyes puts it : \"It\u2019s easy to stare at a photo or movie of a nude woman and create the perfect fantasy with her. But where do you live? You live in real life, not in fantasy. So what happens when the way we view women is completely formed in fantasy, then we get up from the computer to interact with women in real life? Problems ensue, and ensue quickly.\" Both think modern porn destroys men\u2019s ability to relate to women; Shuster just thinks that\u2019s a good thing, or at least an inevitable one.\nAccording to Shuster, this disconnection is why Japanese youth have supposedly stopped having sex , especially when \"having sex with a Fleshlight is almost the same feeling.\" Either way, he says the Japanese attitude \"is universal in all developed countries right now,\" and we\u2019re heading towards the \"sexual singularity,\" defined as \"that point in time when people will prefer networked sex over real-world sex.\" His talk\u2019s title is a slight misnomer: 3D virtual reality isn\u2019t supposed to be the future of porn but the future of the vast majority of human sexual encounters, which will be \"hardly recognizable\" in 15 years.\n\"This entire speech I am going to discuss from a heterosexual male point of view.\"\nWhile I probably should have stopped listening at \"sexual singularity,\" SXSW had promised an expert take on VR and the \"growing influence of the female audience.\" Fortunately, women did come up, but only so Shuster could talk about why he wasn\u2019t going to talk about them. \"This entire speech I am going to discuss from a heterosexual male point of view,\" he explained. \"It has application for every other gender, every other orientation ... It's just easiest for me to discuss in that context.\" Except for a couple of short asides, that promise held.\nWhen Shuster brought up his big historical chart of erotic media, it was interesting to see what didn\u2019t make the grade \u2014 mentioning the massive but stereotypically feminine genre of written erotica might have actually undermined the common VR-futurist claim that deeper immersion always drives out shallower, for example. Shuster walked through a detailed comparison of VHS and DVD porn, but his accounting of the past 50 years of sex and tech included nothing about sexting, slash fiction, or anything else not almost totally focused on men who like women.\nAfter deciding to ignore half (or more) of the human population, Shuster moved on to ignoring the other interesting part of the VR equation: technological barriers. Forget the careful hype deflation of Oculus and Sony, or the frustrating and fascinating climb towards each new milestone. We\u2019re apparently on the cusp of high-quality, fully interactive virtual reality and a revolution in simulated touch \u2014 I believe the phrase Shuster used was \"ready to explode onto the marketplace.\" Not that we actually got to hear about any of it, because it involved \"new kinds of haptics that I am not allowed to talk about,\" comparable to \"the Matrix and the Holodeck.\" I have no idea what kind of haptics are in The Matrix, but since they can kill people, I guess they must be pretty good.\nAs Shuster continued, I tried to figure out how putting people in virtual space and re-skinning them would solve his original problem \u2014 the issue of perfect control. If there\u2019s a single, defining element of enthusiastically consensual sex, it\u2019s that one person doesn\u2019t get to dictate everything about it \u2014 there\u2019s exploration, compromise, and occasionally disappointment. In VR, everybody involved might be better-looking, but you\u2019re fundamentally just adding another layer of complexity.\nThinking this might just be an oversight, I figured I should give him a chance to address it. So after waiting through a lot of questions that I didn\u2019t transcribe but recall largely as \"VR porn will be awesome, but I\u2019m not sure how awesome,\" I asked how \"networked sex\" with a real partner would satisfy the desire for always seeing exactly the right woman doing exactly the right thing. I didn\u2019t get his response transcribed perfectly either, but here\u2019s the general answer in slightly less explicit language:\nImagine you\u2019re with a partner, but what she\u2019s doing doesn\u2019t feel good enough. You can hit a button, and suddenly it\u2019s a haptic recording of Sasha Grey, or anyone else in a library of experiences you\u2019ve stored. Or, if you get bored, you can flip through avatars of different partners to shake things up.\nIsn\u2019t that just better porn, not \"networked sex\"? I followed up. Why does it matter that there\u2019s a human behind it, if you don\u2019t actually see or feel them, and they don\u2019t have a say in what happens? \"That\u2019s his point!\" someone muttered behind me. When the talk was over a few minutes later, a random male audience member approached me and called me a \"ball-buster.\" I told him that I just want people to be honest if they\u2019d rather have sex with robots.\nMaybe Shuster is a troll whose audience didn\u2019t get the joke, or maybe he actually is just as blinkered and hyperbolic as he sounded. Even if it\u2019s supposed to be ironic, why did SXSW promise The Future of VR Porn and deliver The Ridiculous Future of Sex for Straight Men who Hate Sex?\nLet's talk about universal fandom plugins and post-human sensation\nI\u2019ve had a wonderful experience in the VR community, although I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s uncomfortable with its extraordinarily large gender gap. I\u2019ve never encountered Utherverse in that community, and the single host who appeared briefly before Shuster wasn\u2019t affiliated with VR at all. It\u2019s not SXSW or the VR world\u2019s fault that terrible speakers exist. But there\u2019s no reason to host a prime-time panel on an incredibly popular topic \u2014 one that crops up constantly in even the most family-friendly talks \u2014 and give it almost entirely to one man who admits he can\u2019t or won\u2019t speak to the desires of an entire gender, and whose ideal experience is one where he can control people of that gender completely.\nIt\u2019s not just creepy, it\u2019s boring and narrow. The height of eroticism is apparently just straight guys getting better versions of things straight guys already have an endless supply of. Is Sasha Grey, an actress whose adult career ended before Oculus was even founded, really our signpost to the future? Here\u2019s a short list of much cooler things, for example, that we could have talked about:\nWill \"we\u2019re not compatible\" take on a new meaning after companies introduce competing intimacy SDKs?\nWhat does privacy look like when every encounter is streamed and, by extension, recorded?\nWhat new, post-human bodies and sensations will we create?\nWill communities start building universal fandom APIs, allowing artists to create thousands of their own immersive stories with the same sets of characters?\nSince all sex would effectively also be pornography, what happens to people over the age of consent but under 18?\nHow do you apply copyright to a simulated touch?\nInstead, SXSW gave us the worst pitch for virtual erotica since IGN described how to use it for homosexual aversion therapy.\nI\u2019ve discussed, and often critiqued, some extraordinary predictions about virtual reality. But this is the first time I\u2019ve wondered why I bother to write about it at all. Even if nobody\u2019s thinking about Utherverse specifically, it\u2019s received wisdom that sex will be a huge driver of VR. It\u2019s rare to meet a modern VR evangelist who won\u2019t say, at some point, that the heart of virtual reality is the ability to make your fantasies come true. But unless a lot of people decide to actively fight the status quo, I\u2019m increasingly sure that women like me will never be the \"you\" in that sentence \u2014 just the fantasy. If the medium actually does take off, it will be just as conservative as its predecessors.\nAt this point, the best I can do is make sure nobody utters the words \"sexual singularity\" ever again.\n","Title":"SXSW's creepy virtual sex talk is everything wrong with VR hype | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment","essay","sxsw-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7979488"]}
