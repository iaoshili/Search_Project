Not Taylor Swift's dancing, or Paul McCartney aging in front of our eyes, or Pharrell's  other hat . No, this was an anti-smoking PSA for Truth, and it was awful.\nThe video features the X Factor singing creation Fifth Harmony, teen pop nugget Becky G, and YouTube stars like  Alphacat and Jimmy Tatro offering some advice: if you see a smoker on Tinder, \"left swipe dat.\" (The left swipe is the bad one.) It's not terrible advice, but it's presented in the most irritating way possible.\nI already deleted Tinder\nThe chorus is sung in a squeaky clean half-rap peppered with aggressive growling. There's a dolphin riding a rainbow. There's a woman thrusting her pelvis against a Greek statue with wild abandon. There's a pack of slow-moving white horses a la Kanye's \" Bound 2 .\" There's a bearded man with a pile of onion rings the size of a toddler, and I think the music video would shame him too if the smokers on Tinder didn't take precedence.\nI want to cry. I want some onion rings. I want to left swipe this music video forever.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
