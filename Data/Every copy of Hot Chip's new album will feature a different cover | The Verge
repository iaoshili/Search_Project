{"Main text":"Music\nEvery copy of Hot Chip's new album will feature a different cover\nVisual artist Nick Relph has created an algorithm to shift the color of the album art 501 times\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLondon graphic designer Wallzo, aka Darren Wall, has created album art for the British electro-pop band Hot Chip since 2003, but for their upcoming album, Why Make Sense?, Hot Chip is trying something a little different. Infinitely different, that is.\nVisual artist Nick Relph built an algorithm capable of creating subtle variations on the black and white optical illusion seen above. That, paired with 501 potential background colors, means every copy of the physical album (on CD and LP) will be unique. Relph will use whatÂ  Domino Records is calling \"a unique and bespoke printing technique,\" to create the artwork.\nWhy Make Sense? (which is either an ode to The Talking Heads or a dis) is out on May 18th. You can listen to the album's first single, \"Huarache Lights,\" below.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
