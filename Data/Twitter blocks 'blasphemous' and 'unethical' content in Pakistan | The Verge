{"Main text":"Twitter blocks 'blasphemous' and 'unethical' content in Pakistan\nBlocked content includes images of burning Qurans and drawings of the Prophet Muhammad\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTwitter is complying with a Pakistani bureaucrat's requests to block what he described as \"blasphemous\" or \"unethical\" content, according to the New York Times . The censored material includes illustrations of the Prophet Muhammad, tweets from anti-Islam bloggers, and photographs of burning Qurans. The full list of appeals made by Pakistan Telecommunications Authority's Abdul Batin can be found on  Chilling Effects Clearinghouse , a database of cease-and-desist notices from across the Internet.\nPakistan's controversial blasphemy laws have resulted in some staggering shows of censorship. The New York Times cites an example where an article entitled \"Pakistan's Tyranny of Blasphemy\" was replaced by a blank space in a local edition of the International News York Times. Back in March, a publishing partner of the same publication  removed a cover story from 9,000 local copies after suffering an earlier attack by extremists. While this is the first time that the microblogging service has withheld content from Pakistani users, Twitter has honored similar requests before. The company has blocked access to a neo-Nazi group at the behest of local German authorities and stopped Turkish users from viewing accounts belonging to three whistleblowers.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
