{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDaniel Craig is signed on for just one more Bond film after  2015's Spectre , which means a new actor will soon step into the role of 007. And it seems like  almost everyone wants to see Idris Elba portray the martini-sipping special agent.\nEarlier this morning, the Englishman slyly addressed the rumors on Twitter: \"Isn't 007 supposed to handsome? Glad you think I've got a shot!\"\nIsn't 007 supposed to handsome? Glad you think I've got a shot! Happy New year people. pic.twitter.com\/3g9lAl2Uo3\n\u2014 Idris Elba (@idriselba) December 27, 2014\nElba has long been rumored to be the next Bond, and thanks to the Sony Pictures hack, we know that executives at the highest levels of the company have at least considered the actor for the role.  A leaked email from Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal, addressed to a Columbia Pictures executive, stated that \"Idris should be the next Bond.\" And this isn't the first time Elba has spoken about the role: the actor said in  a Reddit AMA a few months ago that he would \"absolutely\" play the first black Bond if the job were offered to him.\nOf course, if Elba is the next Bond, he'd be just the latest in a long line of non-Scottish actors to take on the role. For now, we'll just have to wait and see \u2014 it's unlikely we'll get confirmation until Craig completes his stint as Bond in a couple of years.\n","Title":"Idris Elba addresses James Bond rumors: 'Isn't 007 supposed to be handsome?' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
