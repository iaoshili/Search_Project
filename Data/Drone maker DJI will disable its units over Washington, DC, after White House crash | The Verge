{"Main text":"Drone maker DJI will disable its units over Washington, DC, after White House crash\nRookie pilots will get a little extra help determining what's a no-fly zone\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFollowing the crash of one of its  Phantom drones at the White House on Monday and a response from President Obama that more  regulation of drones was needed , Chinese drone maker DJI will reportedly be  disabling its units from flying over the DC area . According to the FAA, it was already against federal regulations to fly in that region, not to mention the fact that the pilot told the Secret Service he was drinking.\nDJI can make airports or whole cities off-limits to its GPS system\nDJI previously stated to The Verge that it  programmed its drones to stop flying when they reached a certain distance from airports. Using the GPS, DJI can track a drone's position at all time and establish which zones are off limits. But this would mark the first time DJI is preventing flight over a metro area.\n\"DJI will release a mandatory firmware update for the Phantom 2, Phantom 2 Vision, and Phantom 2 Vision+ to help users comply with the FAA\u2019s Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) 0\/8326, which restricts unmanned flight around the Washington, DC metropolitan area,\" the company wrote in a press release this morning. \"The updated firmware (V3.10) will be released in coming days and adds a No-Fly Zone centered on downtown Washington, DC and extends for a 25 kilometer (15.5 mile) radius in all directions. Phantom pilots in this area will not be able to take off from or fly into this airspace.\"\nDJI also said \"the restriction is part of a planned extension of DJI\u2019s No Fly Zone system that prohibits flight near airports and other locations where flight is restricted by local authorities. These extended no fly zones will include over 10,000 airports registered with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and will expand no fly zones to ensure they cover the runways at major international airports.\"\nThe drone industry is actually in agreement with Obama that  more regulation is needed . Congress is on board as well, as  evidenced during a recent hearing . The real hurdle has been the FAA, which has moved slowly to establish new rules. The agency has been mandated by Congress to provide an update by this year, but has so far given no indication of when it might arrive.\n","Title":"Drone maker DJI will disable its units over Washington, DC, after White House crash | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","tech"]}
