{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs hackers continue to leak out emails from last month\u2019s attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio is stepping up its battle against the media outlets that have been reporting on the incident. In a letter sent to multiple publications \u2014 including The New York Times ,  Gawker , Recode , and  The Verge \u2014 attorney David Boies asks that companies stop downloading and delete any information they may have, otherwise \"SPE will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss\" that could result. (You can read  Boies' letter to The Verge right here .)\nThe emails and data leaked since the hack have spurred on a media frenzy. Gawker did a deep dive on email exchanges between producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal about the embattled Steve Jobs biopic, while other outlets have covered everything from the salaries of Sony executives to the aliases movie stars use. Last week The Verge uncovered evidence of Project Goliath , an aggressive initiative between the MPAA and the major Hollywood studios designed to thwart piracy that could potentially alter the open nature of the internet itself.\nAaron Sorkin called journalists \"morally treasonous\"\nBut the studio itself has mainly kept quiet thus far, save for Pascal (and Rudin) apologizing for racially offensive jokes made about President Obama\u2019s taste in movies. That changed yesterday with the letters from Boies, a legal world heavyweight who represented Al Gore in Bush v. Gore and  Oracle in its failed infringement suit against Google . The conversation moved further along yesterday with a  New York Times op-ed from writer Aaron Sorkin , whose own emails had been leaked as part of the Jobs biopic discussion. In yesterday\u2019s opinion piece, Sorkin called journalists reporting on the leaked information \"morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable,\" and claimed that none of the emails contained information that warranted public discussion. (Our own Emily Yoshida  outlined our thoughts on the ethical implications of reporting on the leaks \u2014 as well as the importance of bringing Project Goliath to light \u2014 last week.)\nDespite Boies\u2019 efforts, however, it seems unlikely that a letter will stop press momentum on the story. Recently Gawker published an email from Channing Tatum celebrating the success of 22 Jump Street, and just this morning  The Daily Beast revealed talks between Tatum and Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt about a new Ghostbusters film. And that\u2019s just from the data that\u2019s been leaked already: a recent post claiming to be from the group behind the Sony hack  has promised a \"Christmas gift\" of even more leaked information.\n","Title":"Sony's lawyers warn the media: stop reporting on leaked documents, or else | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
