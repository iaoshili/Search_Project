{"Main text":"Britain's biggest newspaper will still print topless Page 3 photos after all\n'So it seems the fight might be back on,' says anti-Page 3 campaign\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Sun's Page 3, a bizarrely anachronistic \"institution\" in which the third page of the UK's best-selling newspaper is dominated by a photo of a topless model giving brief thoughts on immigration, terrorism, or another issue of our time, is apparently continuing as ever.  It was reported earlier in the week that the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid had printed its last pair of bare breasts, but an NSFW tweet from The Sun's official Twitter account refutes the idea.\n\"Further to recent reports in all other media outlets, we would like to clarify that this is Page 3 and this is a picture of Nicole, 22, from Bournemouth,\" reads the caption to the page from Thursday's edition, featuring a topless image under a \"Clarifications and corrections\" header. \"We would like to apologize on behalf of the print and broadcast journalists who have spent the last two days talking and writing about us.\" The No More Page 3 campaign responded with a tweet of its own:\nSo it seems the fight might be back on. Thanks to @TheSunNewspaper for all the publicity they've given the campaign. See you tomorrow xxx\n\u2014 NoMorePage3 (@NoMorePage3) January 21, 2015\nDoubts about Page 3 go all the way to the top of News Corp. \"Brit feminists bang on forever about Page 3 [but] I bet [they] never buy the paper,\" Murdoch  tweeted last year. \"I think [it's] old fashioned but readers seem to disagree. Aren't beautiful young women more attractive in at least some fashionable clothes?\" It would appear that Sun editor David Dinsmore has a different opinion.\nVerge Video Archives: What is the Future of Sex?
