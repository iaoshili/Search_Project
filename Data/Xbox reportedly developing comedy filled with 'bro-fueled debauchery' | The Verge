The  upcoming project is inspired by \"one of the worst roommate stories ever told,\" a tale first published on BroBible. It purportedly features three men who are attempting to build a \"bastion of bro-fueled debauchery\" in a house perched above a \"magical portal.\" Deadline reports that Ian Wolterstorff and Nick Kreiss will be writing for the show, while Avalon Television\u2019s David Martin and Dan Lubetkin serve as executive producers alongside Five All in the Fifth Entertainment's Doug Banker. Microsoft has not confirmed any of these details, or even mentioned East of Exurbia.\nIn April, Xbox Entertainment Studios revealed  a suite of original television projects, including a \"digital feature\" set in the Halo universe and a reality series entitled Every Street United which will feature street soccer players around the world. Dubbed \"Xbox Originals,\" these shows are exclusive to the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and other Microsoft devices. Xbox Originals is expected to launch on Friday with an interactive live broadcast of the Bonnaroo music festival.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
