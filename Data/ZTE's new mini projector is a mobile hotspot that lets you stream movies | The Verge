{"Main text":"Next\nThe Spro 2 is a step up from last year's Spro projector, which debuted at CES 2014 and didn't have Android customizations or act as a hot spot. This model also comes with a remote. The Spro 2 is small enough to fit in most overnight bags, measuring 5.1 by 5.2 by 1.5 inches. Within that, it has a 5-inch touchscreen for controlling Android \u2014 you can even access the Play Store and download apps, games, and communication tools. The Spro 2 can project images up to 120 inches \u2014 though, with a native resolution of 1280 x 720, we're not sure how clear the picture will be at that size. At the smaller projection sizes that we saw, it looked good (just don't bump the table, or it'll start autofocusing again). As a mobile hotspot, it can support up to eight devices over 4G LTE, and features carrier aggregation for faster speeds.\nThe Spro 2 should be available this winter on two major US carriers. Though ZTE declined to say which, The Verge can confirm that it AT&T will provide service. That also means that it's going to be sold on contract because of its LTE connection, which means that this is probably going to be a bit of an office investment. ZTE says that it will be priced in the \"affordable premium\" range, clarifying that as over $600 and maybe close to $1,000. That price will likely be subsidized, however, because it's being sold on contract.\n","Title":"ZTE's new mini projector is a mobile hotspot that lets you stream movies | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
