{"Main text":"M.I.A. just dropped a new song, Can See Can Do\nIt's her first new solo track since 2013\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nM.I.A. released her most recent, slightly disappointing album Matangi back in 2013, and since then, she's been relatively silent (other than dropping a verse on a  Partysquad track ). But this morning, M.I.A. unleashed some new sounds in the form of a beat-splattered song called \"Can See Can Do.\"\nAt first, M.I.A.  teased on Twitter that she was going to release a track called \"All My People,\" but then she backtracked:\nACTUALLY I WANT TO RELEASE \" ALL MY PEOPLE \" WHEN ALL MY PEOPLE ARE READY\n\u2014 M.I.A (@MIAuniverse) March 7, 2015\n\"Can See Can Do\" features a queasy, squelching beat, similar to what we heard in Matangi, and M.I.A.'s politically tilted half-rapped boasts. It's a big, anthemic track, gleefully and refreshingly lacking in subtlety. \"Some people see planes, some people see drones,\" she sings in the chorus, as if we didn't already know which  kind of person she was .\nFrom the looks of it, there may be many more new M.I.A. songs to come. After posting the track,  M.I.A. tweeted , \"to my hardcore fans, hang in there summer is coming,\" hinting that a new album was on the way.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
