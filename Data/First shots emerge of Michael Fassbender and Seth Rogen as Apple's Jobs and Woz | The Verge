Splash News ( via Twitter user Motroman ) briefly posted some shots of Michael Fassbender and Seth Rogen on the set of the film, which has been filming in the Bay Area for the past few weeks. Fassbender's playing Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, while Rogen's playing fellow co-founder Steve Wozniak. These latest photos were captured at De Anza College in Cupertino, just down the road from Apple's current headquarters, where it unveiled the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch last September. The shots were later removed from Twitter.\nFilm crews began work on the project in Jobs' childhood garage in Los Altos, California, last month, later moving up to Berkeley to shoot scenes at a local Mediterranean restaurant. Leaked emails from the hack on Sony Pictures suggested the entire film could be shot in a matter of weeks, though that timeline could have changed considerably.\nThe film is being directed by Slumdog Millionaire's Danny Boyle and is not to be confused with the 2013 film Jobs, which starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak. According to Universal, the plot for this film \u2014 which was penned by Aaron Sorkin \u2014 will center around three product launches including the first Mac, the NeXT cube, and the iPod. Universal detailed its main cast last week, though hasn't set a release date yet.\nUpdate February 2nd, 8:08PM: Here are some more shots from on the set via Twitter user Jack Zhaoo , including inside The Flint Center for the Performing Arts, which is dressed up to look like an Apple keynote.\nCatch us on the next Steve jobs movie #famousboyz pic.twitter.com\/Zq0JVEx7pG\n","Title":"First shots emerge of Michael Fassbender and Seth Rogen as Apple's Jobs and Woz | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
