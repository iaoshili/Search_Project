{"Main text":"Apple Pay's international rollout may begin this fall, starting with Canada\nApple is in discussions with six Canadian banks\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple has plans to bring Apple Pay to Canada this fall, according to  The Wall Street Journal . Apple is reportedly in talks with six of the largest Canadian banks \u2014 National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, and the Bank of Montreal \u2014 which account for over 90 percent of Canadian bank accounts. A debut that large for Apple Pay in its first foreign country would be a boon, but the banks aren't too happy about Apple's fees \u2014 which may be higher than what US banks pay \u2014 and potential security issues like the ones  US banks dealt with earlier this year .\nWhile the fraud issues Apple Pay dealt with a few months ago were more on the banks' authentication methods than Apple Pay itself, the six Canadian banks are reportedly working together and have formed a consortium to make sure their authorization protocols are airtight. Whether Apple Pay will launch with all six Canadian banks simultaneously later this year is still up in the air, but it looks like Canada will be getting a taste of Apple Pay very soon.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
