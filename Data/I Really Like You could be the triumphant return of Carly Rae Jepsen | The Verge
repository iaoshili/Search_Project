{"Main text":"I Really Like You could be the triumphant return of Carly Rae Jepsen\nI really really really really really really can't get this song out of my head\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's hard to have the No. 1 song in the country for what in retrospect still feels like a decade and still come off as an underdog. But somehow, every time I hear about what Carly Rae Jepsen's been up to since the rise and fall of \"Call Me Maybe,\" I find myself hoping against hope that she may one day deliver a pop hit as pure and undeniable. And after one listen of her new single \"I Really Like You,\" I'm cautiously optimistic it may be here.\nWith the aid of producer Peter Svensson (who also produced and wrote Ariana Grande's \"Love Me Harder,\" and more importantly, was in the freakingÂ  Cardigans ,) Jepsen dips into a little bit of that '80s new wave sauce that made Taylor Swift's 1989 the beast that it is, further contributing to a mainstream pop era that, with any justice, will be remembered as the Age of Robyn . But being sonically on trend is not enough \u2014 Jepsen needed a lyric with the same stupid-sweet-exuberance that made \"Call Me Maybe\" so eminently sing-along-able, and she may have found it:\nI really really really really really really like you\nAnd I want you, do you want me, do you want me, too?\nTo further stack the deck, this is the single that Jepsen, Justin Bieber, and uh, Tom Hanks were seen dancing to a couple weeks back during a shoot for a soon-to-be-released music video. I don't want to speak too soon, but the second coming of Carly Rae may be upon us. Hopefully you're mentally prepared to get obsessed with, get sick of, then ultimately fall back in love with this song by this time next year.\nA video posted by BDDW (@bddw_etc) on\nFeb 16, 2015 at 1:59pm PST\n","Title":"I Really Like You could be the triumphant return of Carly Rae Jepsen | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","music"]}
