{"Main text":"Seagate Seven is the world\u2019s thinnest and most beautiful portable hard disk\nCompany celebrates 35 years with a modern take on the mechanical drive\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt just 7mm thick, Seagate calls its new Seven the slimmest 500GB USB 3.0 hard disk drive available. That\u2019s thinner than an iPhone 6 Plus, only with physical platters spinning at incredible speed inside of an all-steel chassis that hints at the mechanics within. The HDD is being launched to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Seagate introducing the world's first mass produced 5.25-inch hard disk for PCs.\nOther than Seagate telling us it\u2019s based upon the 5-mm Angsana drive, the company isn\u2019t giving us much in the way of detail. But that\u2019s ok, this disk isn\u2019t about performance, it\u2019s a message to the world that says, WE ARE SEAGATE now step aside, son. Look for the Seagate Seven to be widely available starting mid- to late-January for $99.99.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
