The sequel has been gestating for years, with original director Ridley Scott set to executive produce.\nWe'd already heard that, although he's reprising his role as replicant bounty hunter Rick Deckard, Ford  wouldn't be the star of the film . We don't know all of the details on the sequel yet, but it appears the lead \u2014 Gosling, likely \u2014 will be chasing Ford's character, years after the events of the original film. The sequel is being directed by Prisoners director Denis Villeneuve.\nOnce more details are out, expectations for the film could rival that of the other huge sci-fi sequel coming soon to screens (the one that coincidentally released  a new trailer today). But we may have to wait longer for a first glimpse: shooting for the movie starts in summer of 2016.\nVerge Video: Unboxing an LG burner from the new Ryan Gosling movie\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
