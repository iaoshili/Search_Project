{"Main text":"Microsoft to support Raspberry Pi 2 with a free version of Windows 10\nA full Windows PC for just $35?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is throwing its weight behind the  newly announced Raspberry Pi 2 today. The Raspberry Pi Foundation's low-cost computer was an instant hit when it first debuted in 2012, and the new Raspberry Pi 2 now includes a more powerful processor and twice as much RAM. While you\u2019ve never been able to officially run copies of Windows on the Raspberry Pi without resorting to an old version or tricks and hacks, Microsoft says it\u2019s \"delivering a version of Windows 10 that supports Raspberry Pi 2.\"\nA full Windows PC for just $35?\nIt\u2019s not clear exactly what version of Windows 10 will be available, but Microsoft is handing it out for free to the Maker community through its  Windows Developer Program for IoT later this year. With the pricing of the Raspberry Pi 2 and Microsoft\u2019s free copy of Windows 10, you could have a full PC for just $35 later this year. We\u2019ll have to wait to hear more information from Microsoft on how Windows 10 will function on the Raspberry Pi 2, but the company says it\u2019s planning to reveal more \"in the coming months.\" It's likely that this version of Windows 10 will only run modern universal apps, as the Raspberry Pi 2 includes an ARM-based processor.\nMicrosoft is currently developing Windows 10 as part of a public series of previews, and the company is relying heavily on feedback. We recently got a chance to see the new operating system  running on 8-inch tablets ,  phones ,  PCs , and the  Xbox One . With new universal apps, a fresh browser, and the return of the Start Menu, Microsoft is expected to ship Windows 10 later this year on PCs, tablets, phones, and even miniature devices like the Raspberry Pi 2.\n","Title":"Microsoft to support Raspberry Pi 2 with a free version of Windows 10 | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
