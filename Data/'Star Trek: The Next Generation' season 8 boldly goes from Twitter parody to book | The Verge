{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nStar Trek: The Next Generation ended its run on TV in 1994 after seven acclaimed seasons, but what if it hadn't? Parody Twitter account  \"TNG Season 8 ( @TNG_S8 )\" has been imagining new, ever-sillier storylines for the never-made eighth season since October 2011. Now, it's being turned into an illustrated guidebook all unto its own, with the official licensing from the franchise.\nStar Trek: The Next Generation: Warped, An Engaging Guide to the Never-Aired 8th Season, is written by Mike McMahan, who runs the Twitter account, with illustrations from Joel Watson (creator of webcomic  HiJINKS ENSUE ) and Jason Ho (illustrator of comics for The Simpsons and Futurama). It's due out March 3rd, 2015, and is said to contain everything from episode descriptions to new aliens to \"behind-the-scenes\" accounts of the show's \"troubled production,\" according to  StarTrek.com . Until then, we've rounded up some of our favorite fictional storylines from @TNG_S8 below.\nPicard must relax for a week while his new heart is delivered.
