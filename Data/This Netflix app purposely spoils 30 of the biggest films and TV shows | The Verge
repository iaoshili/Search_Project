{"Main text":"This Netflix app purposely spoils 30 of the biggest films and TV shows\nTry this at home\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBehind this door lie some of the biggest spoilers in TV and film. What you are about to see cannot be unseen.\nSpoilers. A piece of information, delivered via utterance or a vignette of clips, that gives away future plot points and potentially casts earlier scenes in a different light. Is [person X] a liar \/ cheater \/ impersonator \/ ghost \/ vampire \/ time traveling ancestor \/ lizard person? Did the husband \/ wife \/ sister \/ brother \/ toddler commit the murder? Will [two attractive romantic leads] end up together?\nI don't care about spoilers. If the experience of watching a two-hour movie or a 20-episode television season can be ruined by a 20-second clip, then for me it probably wasn't much of a story to begin with. If you feel the same way \u2014 or if you at least think you do \u2014 here's your chance to prove it.\nNetflix has created a spoiler torture device. Skip past eye-rolling sections like \"Which Spoiler Are You?\" and go straight to \" Spoil Yourself .\" If you click through the multiple levels of warnings, you'll find yourself watching a rotating set of small clips showing pivotal scenes from late in a TV show or film's storyline. Some are innocuous enough (good triumphs over evil in [action movie]), but others are legitimate twists \u2014 and there's no warning what scene you're about to see. Trust me, I just watched them all.\nMeta-spoiler time: here's a list of every video clip I've found in Netflix's vault of spoilers. Don't worry, since Big Red doesn't have the rights to play Star Wars, the identity of Luke Skywalker's father remains a secret.\nTV Shows\nBattlestar Galactica Season 4 (series finale)\nBojack Horseman Season 1\nBreaking Bad Season 5 (two different scenes)\nDesperate Housewives Season 8\nHell on Wheels Season 2\nHouse of Cards Season 2 (two different scenes)\nLost Season 6 (series finale)\nOrange is the New Black Season 2\nPretty Little Liars Season 4\nRevenge Season 3 (two different scenes)\nScandal Season 3\n","Title":"This Netflix app purposely spoils 30 of the biggest films and TV shows | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
