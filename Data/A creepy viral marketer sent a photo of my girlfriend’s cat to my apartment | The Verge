{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUnder most circumstances, I\u2019m actually a pretty big fan of viral marketing. Whether you\u2019re talking about a  mysterious cell phone or an  elaborate alternate reality game , it\u2019s fun to have the line between our reality and a fictional world blurred just a little. It might not always work \u2014 okay, most of the time it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 but when everything clicks into place, it\u2019s like you\u2019re Neo in The Matrix: nothing around you is what it seems, and you\u2019re the hero of the story.\nSo I was pretty excited when a couple of days ago a stranger was waiting outside my door with a big box wrapped with a bow. Inside was a note along with something very cool: a heat-sensitive Tetris coffee mug. I remembered them from back in the \u201880s \u2014 I\u2019ve been  obsessed with the \u201880s lately \u2014 but then I read the note. \"Thank you for letting me borrow your Game Boy when we were younger,\" it read. \"Remember all the hours of Tetris?\"\nIt was signed with a Twitter handle, @YourFriendGordo, and a look at the back revealed the logo for a company named STX Entertainment. A quick Google search later, it was obvious this was all about a new Jason Bateman movie called The Gift, in which Bateman\u2019s character is harassed by an old friend named Gordo (Joel Edgerton, who also writes and directs) over some past perceived wronging.\nTetris coffee mug courtesy of @YourFriendGordo .

It was the only game I ever had for the handheld, and I played it all the time. It all just seemed to be a coincidence of groupthink nostalgia, but then I noticed that many other journalists had also received packages, each with their own personalized gift.\nThere was a reason the folks behind The Gift knew I was a Tetris Game Boy fan:  I\u2019d mentioned it on Twitter last year .\nThat could have been a step across the line (and for some it was), but I loved it. Somebody was out there, poring over people\u2019s Twitter feeds, and injecting a jolt of that alternate reality game vibe \u2014 \"ARG\" for those of us who pour over these things \u2014 into my Tuesday. When the trailer for The Gift came out the following day, it was even clearer what was going on, and the green wrapping on the box I received made even more sense.\nThen yesterday, there was another knock on my door. I opened it up to the sound of someone running away down the stairs. I looked out my apartment window, but couldn\u2019t see anybody outside. There was a sketchy-looking white van, but if I got freaked out about every sketchy-looking white van in Sherman Oaks I\u2019d never leave the house.\nBy my open door was a thin green envelope, my name hand-written on it, and sealed with a glob of wax imprinted with a \"G.\" I was excited. What was it going to be? How much more creepy could \"Gordo\" get?\nAs it turns out\u2026 a lot more creepy.\nInside were four Polaroid-style prints. I recognized the first as an Instagram picture I\u2019d posted years ago. Another, of me  on a plane to CES (with some creepy guy with a monkey mask photoshopped into the background). The third was my girlfriend\u2019s cat.\nI\u2019m allergic to cats, which means they all immediately want to crawl all over me at every waking hour. It\u2019s a small thing, but it can create awkward moments, especially when your partner loves their pet. My girlfriend does, and for good reason: her cat Ruby is amazing, and I\u2019ve totally become one of those people that  endlessly posts cat pictures because I simply can\u2019t stand the adorableOMGcuteness that Ruby exudes.\nBut despite the fact that I\u2019m posting these pictures for the entire internet to see, those moments with Ruby still feel personal. They\u2019re intimate, no matter how large the size of the potential audience, and to receive one back at first felt disturbing \u2014 which I liked \u2014 and then like a violation. You can use pictures of me to market your movie, but you can\u2019t use pictures of the cat, dammit.\nYou can use pictures of me, but you can't use pictures of the cat, dammit\nThen there was the final snapshot. Last year at SXSW I got to meet Bill Cosby. At the time, it was a fun experience and I couldn\u2019t have been more excited to  share it online . Since then, well\u2026 my feelings about Bill Cosby have changed. I\u2019ve thought several times about deleting that picture from my Instagram feed \u2014 I certainly wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea of it being perceived as any kind of tacit endorsement \u2014 but I always came back to the same conclusion. That it was a moment in time that I had documented online, and I should let it be just that. But that\u2019s before it was printed out and sent to me in a green envelope.\nWas I being judged by the marketers? Did they intentionally pick that image, knowing that it would upset me? Did they think I should be ashamed by it \u2014 and why the hell did I even care?\nThat\u2019s where The Gift got in its own way. The folks selling the movie want me thinking about the film, but instead I\u2019m thinking about myself. Their antics were certainly effective \u2014 hey, I\u2019m writing this article right now, aren\u2019t I? \u2014 and I have no larger ethical beef about the campaign itself. But when the line between the thriller movie and reality is blurred, it\u2019s only fun when you know you\u2019re on the safe side.\n","Title":"A creepy viral marketer sent a photo of my girlfriend\u2019s cat to my apartment | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment","film"]}
