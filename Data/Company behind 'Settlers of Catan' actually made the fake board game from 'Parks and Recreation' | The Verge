{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Cones of Dunshire is every Parks and Recreation fan's favorite made-up board game, but it turns out wildly complex game isn't quite as fictional as we all thought. Mayfair Games, the publishers of German board game favorite Settlers of Catan, worked with the show's producers to design the basic version of Cones used in season six. And now a fleshed-out version of the game as been played in real life. A total of 33 players partook in some Cones action earlier this month at the Gen Con gaming conference in Indianapolis as part of a charity event that  raised over $20,000 .\nIn the world of Parks and Rec, resident nerd (and huge Settlers fan) Ben Wyatt first came up with the game during a misspent week between jobs. Mayfair Games worked to keep true to that story when building a playable version of Cones. A company representative told  local Indianapolis site Nuvo that it \"tried to walk a line between something playable, and something still rooted in the crazed imagination of an unemployed geek.\" No word on whether Cones will ever hit a toy shop near you, but the company has taken out a trademark for the game just in case. For much more on the making of Cones, be sure to  check out this Vulture interview from last year. There's also a small intro video below featuring actor Adam Scott that was shown to players in Indianapolis before the Cones commenced.\n","Title":"Company behind 'Settlers of Catan' actually made the fake board game from 'Parks and Recreation' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
