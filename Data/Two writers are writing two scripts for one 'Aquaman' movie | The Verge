{"Main text":"Two writers are writing two scripts for one 'Aquaman' movie\nWill Beall and Kurt Johnstad will be fishing for audience approval\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWill Beall (Gangster Squad) and Kurt Johnstad (300) are both writing a script each for the upcoming Aquaman movie,  according to The Hollywood Reporter. This is not an unusual decision by industry standards as a growing number of studios are reportedly hiring two writers at once in order to step up production tempo.\nThe news is just part of the scant details orbiting the development of Aquaman as an on-screen presence. In June, Variety stated that Games of Thrones' Jason Momoa was officially confirmed as the face of the blonde-haired Atlantean. Then earlier this month, director Zack Snyder supposedly called in to a Detroit radio broadcast  to defend Aquaman , hinting at the superhero's role in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. No release date has been announced yet, but The Hollywood Reporter notes that the first untitled DC movie in  Warner Bros' extensive line-up will surface on August 5th, 2016.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
