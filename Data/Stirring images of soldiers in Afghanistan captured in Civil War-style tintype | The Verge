He was deployed to Afghanistan for three months in 2013 and decided to commemorate the time by taking photos of his fellow service members using tintype, a Civil War-era technique. The resulting photos are emotional and gritty. President Barack Obama recently announced plans to pull all troops from Afghanistan by 2016 .
