{"Main text":"US & World\nJulian Assange plans to leave Ecuadorian embassy 'soon'\nWikiLeaks founder is suffering from health problems after living in exile for two years, but details on his departure remain vague\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange says he will soon leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London, in a move that would end a two-year standoff with authorities. Assange has been living under asylum at the embassy since 2012, after Swedish investigators called him in for questioning over allegations of sexual assault. Assange faces likely arrest if he leaves the grounds of the Ecuadorian embassy, and has feared that doing so would result in his extradition to the US, where the Justice Department has been investigating WikiLeaks since the organization began publishing troves of classified diplomatic cables in 2010.\nAt aÂ  press conference Monday, the 43-year-old Australian national told reporters that he will leave the embassy \"soon,\" but \"not for the reasons the Murdoch press are saying at the moment.\" Reports have suggested that Assange needs medical care for heart and lung ailments, and that he has suffered from a vitamin D deficiency due to a lack of sunlight. At today's press conference, Assange implied that he has faced \"difficulties\" with his health, but did not elaborate further. He didn't provide details on when he may leave the embassy or how his departure may play out, adding further intrigue to his ongoing international saga.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
