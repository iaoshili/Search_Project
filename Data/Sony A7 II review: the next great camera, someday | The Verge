After capable smartphones decimated the point-and-shoot market, camera makers have focused their efforts on appealing to enthusiasts and professional photographers \u2014 those that need or want more than a smartphone can provide. We\u2019ve gotten really great cameras from the likes of Fujifilm , Panasonic , Olympus , and Sony that prioritize manual controls and image quality, while still being more compact and approachable than the DSLRs that dominated the aughts.\nIn that vein, Sony recently released the A7 II, a compact mirrorless camera that could replace the big DSLR rigs many professionals still cling to. The A7 II is actually a successor to last year\u2019s A7 , which blew minds by being the first interchangeable lens mirrorless camera with a full-frame (read: very large) image sensor. The A7 appeared to be everything a lot of photographers wanted: it promised to provide full-frame image quality (namely, better images in low light and greater control over depth of field) in a package that was much more compact than a DSLR.\nBut for all of the promise and hope attached to the A7, it didn\u2019t quite live up to that in the real world. Limited (and expensive) lens choices, sluggish autofocus, and image quality that was good but not stellar left many wanting for more. The A7 (and the high-resolution A7R and video-focused A7S that followed later) found a niche among owners of vintage manual lenses looking for a more modern body to adapt them to, but they didn\u2019t do much to shake up the full-frame DSLR world.\nThe A7 II is designed to right many of the A7\u2019s wrongs. (The original A7, A7R, and A7S are staying in the lineup, albeit with lower prices than before.) The $1,699 A7 II ($1,999 with a 28-70 lens, as tested) has the same 24-megapixel full-frame sensor and relatively compact frame as before. It\u2019s a serious camera for serious photographers, just like last year\u2019s model. But this time Sony has quickened the autofocus system, improved the ergonomics and controls, and added an all-new in-body image stabilization system that works with virtually any lens, modern or vintage.\nAll of those are welcome improvements and address many of the very real issues I had with last year\u2019s camera. A year after the original A7 debut, Sony\u2019s compact wonder has done little to topple the full-frame camera oligarchy ruled by Canon and Nikon. The A7 II is a welcome step forward, but after using it for the past few weeks, I don\u2019t think Canon and Nikon have anything to worry about just yet.\nThe changes that Sony has made to the A7\u2019s design are fairly minor, but they do improve the camera\u2019s handling and build. The lesser A7 made do with a plastic front plate, but the second iteration is completely metal, which is more befitting of its nearly $2,000 price tag. (It doesn\u2019t make much of a difference in the feel of the camera, however.) The grip has been redesigned with a larger area for your fingers and a more traditional front dial that falls right under your index finger. The shutter button has moved down from the top plate to the grip itself, and there are now two custom buttons in its former location.\nOverall, the camera is nicer and more comfortable to hold, but it\u2019s not hugely different from the first A7. I didn\u2019t really have any problems with the camera\u2019s ergonomics before, and I still don\u2019t now; there are a lot buttons and dials on this camera, and all of the controls I look for are at my fingertips. I can adjust almost any parameter without having to wade through byzantine menus. Most importantly, the A7 II doesn\u2019t get in my way and lets me focus on capturing and composing pictures, instead of fiddling with menus and settings.\nOtherwise, the A7 II is almost identical in design to the A7. It has the same throwback manual film SLR look as last year\u2019s camera, complete with a viewfinder hump that proudly displays Sony\u2019s logo. It wasn\u2019t a bad design last year, and it\u2019s still not a bad design \u2014 this looks like a camera should look.\nThe A7 II looks like how a camera should look\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the A7 II is significantly heavier than virtually any other mirrorless camera, and it\u2019s almost 30 percent heavier than last year\u2019s A7. It\u2019s also about 10mm thicker to accommodate the new image stabilization system. The A7 II is closer in weight to a full-frame DSLR than the average mirrorless camera. It\u2019s a real camera for when you are going to \"take pictures,\" not something that is easily carried around at all times to capture those spontaneous moments.\nAside from the new grip and metal front plate, the rest of A7 II is unchanged: the 3-inch LCD is bright and sharp and tilts when you need it to, the back has lots of buttons and controls, and the viewfinder is sharp and bright with a fast refresh rate. It\u2019s not as good as Fujifilm\u2019s X-T1 larger and sharper viewfinder, but it\u2019s still very good and doesn\u2019t make me long for a true optical viewfinder. Unfortunately the shutter is still very loud and clacky-sounding. It sounds like the camera is tearing apart from the inside out with every frame I snap. It\u2019s not reassuring and means the A7 II isn\u2019t very discreet in quiet environments, such as a baby\u2019s nursery or a church.\nWhile Sony mostly kept the design and exterior of the A7 II the same as its predecessor, there are some notable enhancements to the camera\u2019s performance. Perhaps most important is a faster autofocus system, which Sony says is 30 percent quicker than before. Autofocus on the first A7 models was sluggish and inconsistent, making them frustrating to use. This time around it is noticeably faster, but it\u2019s still inconsistent, often missing focus. I often had to take multiple frames in a hope that one will be in focus and usable. Though improved, the A7 II\u2019s autofocus is not nearly as fast as other mirrorless cameras, much less a full-frame DSLR.\nThe other major upgrade is the new in-body image stabilization system, which can stabilize camera movement on up to five axes (pitch, yaw, up and down, left and right, and roll). It\u2019s the first image stabilization system of its kind for full-frame cameras and can function with virtually any lens mounted to the camera, even vintage manual lenses used with adapters. If you happen to have a bunch of old Leica lenses sitting around, you can now get the benefits of modern image stabilization when they are mounted on the A7 II, which is pretty cool. Sony says the system provides up to 4.5 stops of compensation, which is comparable to lens-based image stabilization.\nThe image stabilization system will probably be most useful to those that use the A7 series with older manual lenses, as the lens I tested the camera with already had image stabilization built into it (the camera will prioritize a lens\u2019 system if it is available). Image stabilization helps you take sharper images in low light and with longer lenses, but it doesn\u2019t do anything if your subject doesn\u2019t stay put, a common scenario when taking pictures of kids and pets. Still, it\u2019s a welcome addition and should make shooting with old lenses on the A7 II an easier endeavor.\nThe new image stabilization system even works with old manual lenses\nEven with these additions, the A7 II is rated about the same for battery life (350 shots between charges). It\u2019s still not great \u2014 you\u2019ll want a second battery for days where you\u2019ll be using the camera a lot \u2014 but you can recharge the camera via Micro USB or an external battery charger, which is convenient.\n","Title":"Sony A7 II review: the next great camera, someday | The Verge","Tags":["photography","review","tech"]}
