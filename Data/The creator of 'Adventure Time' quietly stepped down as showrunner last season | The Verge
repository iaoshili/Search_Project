{"Main text":"The creator of 'Adventure Time' quietly stepped down as showrunner last season\nPendleton Ward will stay on as writer and storyboard artist\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe creator of Adventure Time, simultaneously the most colorful (aesthetically) and the darkest (mythology) cartoons out there right now, has downgraded his role. According to aÂ  Rolling Stone profile , Pendleton Ward quit as showrunner at some point during season five. The relevant piece from Rolling Stone:\nHe says this not with sadness or frustration, but with relief. \"For me, having quality of life outweighed the need to control this project and make it great all the time.\" So he stepped down from running Adventure Time to become simply one of the show's writers and storyboard artists.\nAsked if he'd ever want to create another TV show, Ward responds with horror: \"No, never. That sounds like a nightmare!\"\nWard has remained (and presumably will remain) on the show as a writer and storyboard artist. And according to the profile, he might consider writing an Adventure Time movie. Feel free to think of Ward as tucked away in the front pocket of Adventure Time's future.
