You just had to know this was coming. \"One last ride,\" after all, is just a metaphor that means \"just kidding there's still some fuel in the tank and the tires are in pretty good condition.\" Another Fast and Furious film. What also helps, of course, is that  Furious 7 currently sits as  the 7th highest-grossing film of all time (worldwide) and is still in theaters. Furious 8 is coming April 14th, 2017.\nThe announcement was made by Vin Diesel at Cinema Con, who is calling it Furious 8 (as opposed to Fast and Furious 8 or something more integrated like F8st 8nd Furi8us). Earlier this month, Diesel said the  new movie would be set in New York City \u2014 which is to say, we're gonna see a Dodge Challenger jump over Lady Liberty herself. No director has been announced; after shepherding the franchise to high-octane critical and commercial success, Justin Lin (Tokyo Drift through Fast 6) gave the reins to Saw alum James Wan for 7. Lin is probably  too busy with Star Trek 3 to return while Wan is reportedly in the running  for Aquaman . \"What's Wes Anderson up to?\" most of The Verge's New York office just asked out loud, only mostly joking.\n'We did it as a family and I love you for that' - Vin Diesel after announcing the 'Furious 8' date as April 14, 2017 #cinemacon\n\u2014 Dave McNary (@Variety_DMcNary) April 23, 2015\nRide or die. There is no try.\nAnd while you wait, feel free  make your own Fast and Furious sequel .\nVerge Video: Every Fast and Furious movie plot in 10 minutes\n","Title":"Furious 8 is coming in 2017 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
