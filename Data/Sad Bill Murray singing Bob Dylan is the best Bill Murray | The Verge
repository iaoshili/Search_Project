{"Main text":"Sad Bill Murray singing Bob Dylan is the best Bill Murray\nThis is final\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou can divide everyone in your life into two camps: the fans of dry-humored, early-period Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day), and the fans of sad-sack, late-period Bill Murray (Lost in Translation, Wes Anderson appearances). There is no middle ground. You can make a case for either, but I'd throw my lot in with the late-period folks, precisely for stuff like this just-released clip from the upcoming movie St. Vincent.\nAccording toÂ  a synopsis for the film, Bill Murray plays \"a retired curmudgeon with a penchant for alcohol and gambling.\" It features this excellent clip of Bill Murray singing an off-tune version of Bob Dylan's \"Shelter From the Storm\" while having a smoke, which is essentially The Case For Old Bill Murray in about three minutes.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
