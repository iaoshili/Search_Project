Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) Studios and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment collaborated with cult decor company Skuzzles to create limited edition artwork for 13 cult classics. Like the movie posters of yesterday, these images are bold, vibrant, and sometimes just a little over-the-top.\nJoshua Budich's take on The Return of the Living Dead is soaked in reds, and largely dominated by the grotesque Tarman who looms like an oozing nightmare moon over the movie's punkish cast. The Last House on the Left is far subtler, comprised of soothing greens and a quiet tranquility that seem absolutely dissonant when paired with the horrific violence of the actual movie. \"I found the scene where Mari walks into the water to be quite haunting and probably the most pivotal moment,\" says artist Dan Mumford in a statement. \"So, I worked from that and created quite a haunting still moment based around the lake she walks into.\" The collection also includes a minimalist design for The Silence of the Lambs, and an eerie exploration of how the aliens in Invasion of the Body Snatchers might interact with the human physiology.\nThe walls of our cinemas are now papered with action-packed movie posters, the kind consisting of salaciously posed women and men in dramatic poses. However, companies like Skuzzle and Mondo help to remind us that once upon a time, these simple promotional items were genuine works of art. The re-released movies carrying these striking faceplates can be found at major retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nCarrie, 1976 by Ghoulish Gary Pulin\nChild's Play - Chucky's 20th Birthday Edition -  25th Anniversary Special Edition, 1976 by Jason Edmiston\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers, 1978 by Todd Slater\nJeepers Creepers - Collector's Edition, 2001 by Francesco Francavilla\nKiller Klowns from Outer Space, 1988 by Jason Edmiston\nThe Last House on the Left, 1978 by Dan Mumford\nMisery - Collector's Edition, 1990 by Paul Shipper\nSpecies, 1995 by Justin Osborne\nTeen Wolf, 1985 by Ghoulish Gary Pulin\nThe Amityville Horror, 1979 by Ghoulish Gary Pulin\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre 2, 1986 by Grzegorz Domaradzki\nSilence of the Lambs, 1991 by Randy Ortiz\n","Title":"Check out this gorgeous limited edition art for 13 classic horror movies | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","entertainment"]}
