But California \u2014 the earliest and largest state to legalize medicinal marijuana \u2014 is running into an entirely different resource crunch. A historic drought has made fresh water scarce, and marijuana turns out to be an especially thirsty plant.\n\"Old hippies are not our problem \u2014 old hippies get it.\"\nAccording to a  report in the New York Times , a single marijuana plant can consume between five and 10 gallons of water a day, far more than the 3.5 gallons required for a head of lettuce. In January, California declared a statewide drought emergency, and areas like Lake, Humboldt, and Mendocino counties \u2014 where pot production is estimated to have doubled between 2009 and 2012 \u2014 began to crack down on growers who were siphoning water from public streams.\n\"We knew people were diverting water for marijuana operations, but we wanted to know exactly how much,\" Scott Bauer, a biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,  told the Associated Press . He found several watershed sites had run dry. \"We didn't know they could consume all the water in a stream.\"\nSome have changed careers from growing pot to supplying water\nThe issue is most dire among the new breed of growers who are cultivating not for personal use, but in the hopes of building a big business. \"Old hippies are not our problem \u2014 old hippies get it,\" Medicino Sheriff Thomas Allman told the New York Times. \"I\u2019m talking about people that move here in April, grow marijuana as fast as they can until October. The 20-year-old kid who wants to make his million bucks, and he\u2019s using these steroid fertilizers. He doesn\u2019t care about how much water he uses, or what he puts in the soil.\"\nOf course, where there is potential disaster, there is also opportunity. \"I've heard people shut down their grow operations, bought water trucks and have changed from growing to supplying waters to the other growers,\"  said Chip Perry , a medical marijuana consultant.\n","Title":"Cotton mouth: California pot startups are sucking the state dry | The Verge","Tags":["business","us-world"]}
