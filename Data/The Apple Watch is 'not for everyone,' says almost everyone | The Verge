{"Main text":"The Apple Watch is 'not for everyone,' says almost everyone\nThe critics agree on one thing\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis morning, some of the smartest writers covering the tech industry published thoughtful and well-considered reviews of the Apple Watch. I've linked them in this post and believe all of them are worth a look. There appears to be one consistent opinion in nearly every major review: the Apple Watch is not for everyone.\nRecode :\n\"Of the half-dozen smartwatches I've tested in recent years, I've had the best experience with Apple Watch. If you're an iPhone power user and you're intrigued by the promises of wearable technology, you'll like it, too. But that doesn't mean Apple Watch is for everyone.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal :\n\"This is a big idea about how we use technology, the kind of idea we expect from Apple. Which isn\u2019t to say that this first Apple Watch will appeal to all iPhone owners, or even a significant fraction of them.\"\nCNET :\n\"I'm not even going to engage the Edition in this discussion: that gold watch is not for you [\u2026] You don't need an Apple Watch. In many ways, it's a toy: an amazing little do-it-all, a clever invention, a possibly time-saving companion, a wrist-worn assistant. It's also mostly a phone accessory for now.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
