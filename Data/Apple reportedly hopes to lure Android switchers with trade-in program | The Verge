{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAccording to  a new report from 9to5Mac , Apple will soon make perhaps its most aggressive push yet to court Android users and get them switched them over to iPhone. The company hopes to accomplish this through a trade-in promotion that will be offered at Apple retail stores. For the first time, that trade-in and recycling program will be expanded to accept non-Apple smartphones. Customers receive a gift card for handing over their current device towards the purchase of a new iPhone, but previously the option was limited to Apple's own hardware and excluded Android products from Samsung, Motorola, LG, and other manufacturers.\nMuch like the existing program, Apple's retail staff will put a trade-in value on your phone based on its cosmetic condition. If there are any obvious scratches, dings, or other defects, the gift card you receive will be worth substantially less. Phones being handed in will also need to be functioning properly. Even if your Android device is in flawless condition, you'd probably be better off selling it on eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, or with other services like Swappa.\n9to5Mac says that Apple's retail employees will help Android users transfer their contacts over to a new iPhone, and training for the updated trade program will reportedly begin later this week. Beyond contacts, customers will be responsible for backing up and preserving their important data when making the switch. Apple previously launched  a guide designed to help Android owners breeze through the transition to iOS and iPhone ; it offers a step-by-step tutorial for moving photos, music, and documents over to Apple's handset.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with the new MacBook trackpad\n","Title":"Apple reportedly hopes to lure Android switchers with trade-in program | The Verge","Tags":["apple","google","mobile","tech"]}
