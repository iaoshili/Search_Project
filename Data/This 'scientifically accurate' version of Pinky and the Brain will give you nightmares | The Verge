{"Main text":"This 'scientifically accurate' version of Pinky and the Brain will give you nightmares\nScientific accuracy is horrifying\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPinky and the Brain was nothing if not a testament to the tenacity of lab mice. The Brain was always plotting some kind of world domination and Pinky was always... eating.  It's a nice reminder that anything can happen \u2014 as long as you remove yourself from reality entirely. Now, the team over at  Animation Domination High-Def has brought reality back into the picture with a \"scientifically accurate\" version of the adored '90s TV show. Spoiler alert: \"scientifically accurate\" here just means \"horrifying.\"\nIn the video above, bloated, bruised versions of the rodent characters go through a series of unpleasant tests often associated with animal-based research. They're electrocuted, prodded with giant needles, forced into complex mazes, and even thrown onto dart boards. If that's not enough to entice you, there's a new theme song too: \"They're laboratory mice \/ so their lives are really nice \/ they'll mostly, they'll mostly be in pain pain pain pain, pain pain pain pain.\"\nThat's all, sleep well.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
