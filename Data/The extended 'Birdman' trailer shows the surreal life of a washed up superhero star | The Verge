{"Main text":"The extended 'Birdman' trailer shows the surreal life of a washed up superhero star\nMichael Keaton returns as a new superhero\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been decades since Michael Keaton was Batman, but it's still impossible not to associate him with the role. Now, Keaton is taking those associations and fictionalizing them in Birdman, where he stars as a washed up actor who used to be synonymous with the flying superhero. The film comes from director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who's made his mark through ensemble films with intertwining stories, like Babel. A  new trailer for Birdman was just released, and it revels in the dark, funny, and surreal. The movie looks incredible (though we've known that  since the first trailer ), and it'll be in theaters later this year on October 17th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
