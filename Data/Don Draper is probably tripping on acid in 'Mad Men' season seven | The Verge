{"Main text":"32 Comments\nOver the course of six seasons, the hedonistic advertising executives on AMC's acclaimed series Mad Men have ingested all sorts of mind-altering substances, from  oceans of booze to  marijuana to  LSD to  speed . But if the  promotional art for the show's final season is any indication, even more intense psychedelic experiences are on the horizon.  The New York Times takes a look at the new poster for season seven part one, showing the iconic shadow of protagonist Don Draper seated on a couch in front of a vibrant, multicolored dreamscape of flowers, a woman, and wine.\nAs The New York Times reports, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner enlisted the help of acclaimed 84-year-old graphic designer Milton Glaser (the creator of the \"I ♥ NY\" logo and a co-founder of New York Magazine) to channel the season's late 1960s setting. Weiner was coy about whether the poster gives away any plot teasers, telling the newspaper: \"This is related to the late \u201960s, which is all I will say about it...It maintains the idea that this is somehow going on in Don Draper\u2019s mind, which is what the story is always about \u2014 and what the back of his head is about, on some level.\" Fans can look forward to returning Don Draper's tormented headspace on  April 13th at 10PM EST for the  first of the planned seven episodes of season seven . The final seven episodes are set to run next year.\n","Title":"Don Draper is probably tripping on acid in 'Mad Men' season seven | The Verge","Tags":["culture","design","entertainment"]}
