{"Main text":"Piper\u2019s home security camera can now see in the dark\nNew $269 NV model adds night vision and a better camera\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPiper is one of the newer home monitoring cameras in a category that\u2019s still trying to figure out what it is. Once the solution for checking in on dogs and babies, these small cameras have evolved into something of an ad-hoc security system for a small home or an apartment, offering things like motion detectors, live video with cloud recordings, and a siren to scare away would-be thieves.\nBut one of Piper\u2019s shortcomings has been a lack of night vision, a standard feature among cameras in its class. This meant that if you wanted to use Piper in your house at night, you were mostly out of luck, short of spending time and money hooking up your home\u2019s lights to its built-in motion sensor.\nThat\u2019s been remedied with the Piper NV, a new night vision-equipped model that goes on sale today for $269. That\u2019s a $60 premium on Piper\u2019s first model, which will continue to be sold for $199. The extra money gets you an array of built-in infrared lights for seeing in the dark and a new camera system that\u2019s sharper.\nAs for why night vision didn\u2019t make it in the first time around, you can blame that on the design of the fisheye lens, says Piper creator Russell Ure. It turns out that its 180-degree viewing angle made it extremely difficult to add infrared emitters that wouldn\u2019t hit the lens and create huge flares of light. The company eventually solved the problem by putting the emitters behind a translucent plastic ring set behind the lens that diffuses the lights. It also changed the shape of the lens ever so slightly to make it more rectangular. Looking at the two models side by side though, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to spot the difference.\nLike Dropcam , Simplicam , and a host of other rivals that already have night vision, Piper\u2019s can be set to go on automatically when it gets too dark, or you can have it on all the time. Visually you can spot the telltale red glow of IR lights around the camera in a darkened room, though it\u2019s not as pronounced or as distracting as some models because of the diffusion.\nBesides night vision, the NV model has made a few other improvements. The company switched to an all-glass lens and a new sensor that\u2019s higher resolution than Piper\u2019s original model \u2014 it\u2019s now 3.4 megapixels instead of 2. Because of the switch to glass, Ure says recordings are much clearer and sharper than they were in the first model, especially when zoomed into any particular area.\nStill not great at seeing faces\nIn a brief test with a demo unit, the image was visibly improved from the first model, but still not quite sharp enough to get a nice shot of someone\u2019s face from about 15 feet away and beyond. That\u2019s big a problem if you\u2019re aiming to identify who someone from a live feed or a stored clip. It also wasn\u2019t capable of discerning fine details as well as something like Dropcam\u2019s Pro model, which lets you zoom in and reprocess the image. Piper manages to trump that by letting you zoom into four separate areas at the same time, but I\u2019ll take quality over quantity.\nHere's how it looks in our server room with the lights on and off, which looks terrifying either way:\nOne other feature that you won\u2019t see from the outside is a new version of the built-in Z-Wave, the wireless protocol that lets you manage control lights and other home automation appliances. The new version gets twice the range of the previous model, has a faster data rate, and introduces encryption. That last bit is particularly important if you wanted to connect Piper to lights and sensors that you want to prevent being tampered with. And the wider range also means that you\u2019ll be able to cover more ground in a house without purchasing extenders, or another Piper unit for another room.\nNot a security system replacement yet\nSo does all this add up to a viable replacement for a home security system? Ask Ure and he\u2019ll say no, at least for now. In part, that\u2019s because Piper was acquired by iControl Networks , which has a hand in creating ADT\u2019s Pulse home security system, and home security systems from cable providers like Comcast, Cox, and Time Warner for a monthly subscription. Piper, which has an upfront cost but no add-on services to speak of, isn\u2019t what those companies are selling to people yet. But that could change.\n\"Piper unlocks for these people a much bigger market, because people who rent, people who have homes who are not inclined to spend $50 a month but may be interested in something smaller and less costly, there\u2019s a whole new market that [these companies are] looking at,\" Ure says. \"And Piper is a good example of things to look at.\"\n","Title":"Piper\u2019s home security camera can now see in the dark | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","hands--on","tech"]}
