{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLibratone has staked a claim in the speaker market thanks to high-quality speakers that contain unmistakable design language \u2014 its tube-shaped Zipp speaker is a perfect example of the unusual but functional designs that the company focuses on. There aren't any black, rectangular boxes to be found here, and Libratone is making sure that remains the case with its latest wireless speaker, the Loop. As you might expect from its name, the Loop is a circular stereo speaker, but its thin profile allows for a neat trick \u2014 it's meant to be hung on your wall. In a lot of ways, its design reminds us of the much-loathed Apple \"puck\" mouse of yesteryear (but since you don't have to use it to control your computer, it can just be appreciated for its style). While Libratone included a kickstand for free-standing playback, you'll get the best sound quality when keeping it on or against near a wall to let the passive radiator bass technology do its work.\nAt 120W, it's twice as powerful as the Zipp, but doesn't match the larger Live in terms of sheer power \u2014 but in our quick listen, the Loop more than held its own. It's not as loud as the live, but has a nice \"open\" sound quality \u2014 and the space-saving design is a major plus for city-dwellers with less room for full-sized speakers. As with the rest of Libratone's recent releases, the Loop supports both DLNA and Airplay for streaming from iOS, Android, Mac, and PC, and it also supports Libratone's PlayDirect technology for streaming music without a Wi-Fi access point. And keeping with Libratone's focus on design, the Loop is also available in three different woolen covers, just like the Live and the Zipp. Default colors include black, grey, and red, and extra covers in yellow, pink, purple, and two shades of blue will be available shortly after launch.\n","Title":"The Libratone Loop is a beautiful, wireless speaker that's more art than gadget | The Verge","Tags":["design","tech"]}
