{"Main text":"Ross Ulbricht seeks a redo of the Silk Road trial\nThe court has until April to make a decision\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month, Ross Ulbricht was  found guilty of seven charges related to his role in operating the quasi-anonymous online market Silk Road. Now Ulbricht's lawyer, Joshua Dratel , is fighting for a retrial.\nIn a  court filing submitted on Friday , Dratel argued the prosecutors in the Silk Road trial failed to disclose evidence in a timely manner. The appeal stated that the \"suppression of particular evidence\" had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial. Dratel also notes that an expert witness, Andreas M. Antonopoulos, was on a plane at the time the submission of his proposed testimony was due. USA Today reports Antonopoulos would have challenged the prosecution's analysis of evidence \"that linked Silk Road-generated bitcoins to an electronic wallet held by Ulbricht.\"\nThis appeal is not a complete surprise. Dratel also  called for a mistrial several times during the case, and was denied by the judge each time.\nThe court has until April to respond to Dratel's filing. Ulbricht's sentencing is scheduled for May 15th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
