{"Main text":"The best and worst ads of Super Bowl XLIX\nBrands played it safe this year \u2014 safe and sad\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBetween terrible play calls and terribly amusing dancing sharks, last night\u2019s Super Bowl XLIX claimed the honor of biggest show of the year for advertising \u2014 the one time when people proudly announce they\u2019ll go to the bathroom during the game itself to avoid missing those prized 30-second spots.\nFor $4.5 million, you, too, can associate yourself with the biggest television event of the year. Sometimes you can get lucky with a tweet or a $700 regional ad buy , but the only surefire way to get your company out front is the commercial buy for the national stage. And though humor found its way into the night, by and large, this year\u2019s Super Bowl ad campaigns were all about family and familiarity.\nOld stalwarts like Anheuser-Busch made decidedly less effort than in years\u2019 past, both in quantity and content. The beer company bought three and a half minutes of airtime (totaling $31.5 million) \u2014  down from four minutes last year and the four and a half minutes before that \u2014 and grouped that time to make just three longer commercials. Of those, two were \"sequels\" (swapping Reggie Watts  for Pac-Man and continuing to use horses as the Vessel Through Which All Good Happens In The World). The final ad was artificially designed to try and label Budweiser as a \"macro\" brewer, with hipsters drinking over an aggressive indie beat and title cards like \"It\u2019s brewed for drinking, not dissecting\" \u2014 some bastardized hybrid of artisanal tone and mainstream branding.\nDads, dads, dads, Dads, Dads\nIt wasn\u2019t just beer that kept it tame. McDonald\u2019s went faux-reality with a message of love. Geico rehashed the months-old Salt-N-Pepa spot, one it knew played well. GoDaddy sexed down this year with an overworked 20-something (which we\u2019re supposed to believe is a last-minute replacement for  that stupidly offensive puppy mill parody ). Coca-Cola made a sentimental jab at  bettering the internet with, what else, Coca-Cola. But \"World Peace is Brokered With Soda\" is Coke\u2019s modus operandi, day in and day out.\nThe big theme, if there\u2019s one to find, was dads: Racing dads who want their son to show the need for speed (Nissan). Crying dads who drop their military-bound daughters off at the airport (Toyota). Affectionate dads that hug and kiss (Dove). Doritos' counter to this \u2014 a guy in an airplane who\u2019s happy to sit next to the \"hot girl\" before realizing she has a baby \u2014 felt wholly out of place. And of course, if you have a child, the Super Bowl is the perfect time to think of the possibility they\u2019ll die in an accident, at least according to Nationwide\u2019s  intentionally jarring , emotionally manipulative 30-second spot (which became a meme by the end of the night).\ngave my kid a bath tonight. she did not die. gotta try harder next time, grim reaper er I mean nationwide\nBasically, it\u2019s all about family. Even  Vin Diesel knows it .\nWhere humor was found, it was by and large driven by tech companies (and one incredible glue maker). Mophie wants you to believe that its battery will last  well into the apocalypse . T-Mobile wants you to believe that Sarah Silverman\u2019s hydroponic garden is full of kale. The creator of Clash of Clans wants you to believe Liam Neeson (aka \"AngryNeeson52\") gets really mad about free-to-play iPhone games. BMW isn\u2019t exactly a tech company, but it did play to the evolution of technology with a clip of Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric  trying to understand the internet in 1994 .\nSo yes, there were laughs \u2014 and yes,  there were movie trailers by the half-dozen (albeit very few surprises). But for the most part, if the game wasn\u2019t making you emotional enough, the ads in between would break you.\nStray observations by the numbers:\nTwo times the elderly were used to sell cars (\"Official Dodge Wisdom\" and My-boner-pill-makes-Fiats-cool)\nTwo times that prosthetic legs were used to tug at the heartstrings (Microsoft and Toyota)\nTwo actors who made The Brady Bunch better: Danny Trejo as Marsha, Steve Buscemi as Jan\nTwo uses of that screaming goat meme (Sprint,  Discover ) \u2014 and countless uses of other memes\nOne Brett Favre cameo. Seriously, even between plays, he can\u2019t seem to leave football behind.\n\"You just won the Super Bowl where are you going next?\"  \"I'm going to Disneyland!\"  *son dies of measles*   Nationwide is on your side\n\u2014 todd molé (@toddmolay) February 2, 2015\nAnd now, some arbitrary awards:\nThe \"best\" ad: Nationwide\nDefined here by, \"the ad that everyone will be talking about and set out what it intended to do.\" It was a shock in the first quarter, a trending topic by the second, and a meme by halftime. As a species, we have truly become desensitized to the world around us.\nThe actual best ad: Loctite\nWithout question, glue maker Loctite made one of the biggest gambles of the night. Advertising Age has (fortuitously) been  following the company as it made its first-ever showing in the game. It was a success in terms of brand awareness, but will it translate to meaningful sales of $3\u2013$10 glue?\nThe real MVP: Land Shark\nKaty Perry\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, made exponentially better by way of Missy Misdemeanor Elliott and a gaggle of people on Twitter making the  same Wiimote strap joke , was awash in bright colors and fun. No matter how much fun you had, however, it wasn\u2019t as much as  the shark to Perry\u2019s right had . Choreography be damned, he\u2019s just happy to be there.\nWinner of the Bechdel Award: T-Mobile\nIf a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man, it passes the \" Bechdel test .\" Comedians Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman made a hilarious ad for T-Mobile more concerned with \"kale.\"\nWeirdest Twitter Stunt: T-Mobile \u2014 and Kim Kardashian\nLook, T-Mobile. I know she\u2019s not actually tweeting at me, and I can see your timeline \u2014 it\u2019s just the same five images in rotation. How did Twitter not flag this for spamming?\nMost improved: Jurassic World trailer\nCredit to  Wired's Kyle Vanhemert , who noticed the vast graphical improvements between last night's Jurassic World teaser and the debut trailer. \"It\u2019s a fascinating glimpse into modern day moviemaking,\" he writes, \"hidden in plain sight.\" Agreed!\nMost scrutinized: Furious 7\nWhich is to say, our own Chris Ziegler decided to  break down a 30-second movie teaser line by line . Okay.\nBest prediction engine (TIE): Madden and Breaking Madden\nWho knew the final score would be 28-24? EA's annual  Madden Super Bowl simulation nailed the score. So, too did  Jon Bois' Breaking Madden season finale . Never count out Touchdown Tom.\nBest use of Nick Offerman\nBy our account, there are about 16 different characters played by Nick Offerman in this NASCAR commercial that immediately followed the Super Bowl. If Ron Swanson isn't driving at least three cars in the next race, I will be reporting NASCAR to the FTC for false advertising.\nBest troll: Chevrolet\nNothing says \"I want you to buy my car\" like giving large swaths of the American population a heart attack by faking a lost signal at the start of the game.\nLearn more\n","Title":"The best and worst ads of Super Bowl XLIX | The Verge","Tags":["culture","editorial","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7724752"]}
