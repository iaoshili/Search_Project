{"Main text":"The living architecture of Philip Beesley\n\"Radiant Soil\" installation immerses viewers in a state of \"delicious vertigo\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPhilip Beesley is a Canada-based architect who has spent years blurring the lines between nature and technology. In 2008, he began work on the Hyozolic series \u2014 a collection of immersive installations that react to, and evolve with, the movements of people who pass through them. The idea, according to Beesley, is to create a \"metabolic architecture,\" whereby manmade structures are seen not as inanimate, fixed objects, but as living, breathing entities, capable of regeneration and growth.\nThe most recent addition to the Hyozolic series, Radiant Soil, debuted earlier this summer at the EDF Fondation in Paris, France. The installation is comprised of tall, plant-like structures made from glass, polymers, and metals that are suspended from the ceiling. The interlinked \"clouds,\" as Beesley calls them, include motion-tracking and touch sensors that trigger certain responses based on a viewer's movements. Touching one of its plume-like branches, for instance, elicits a vibration that slowly contracts and expands the frond, as a soft air stream runs through its \"pores\". Arrays of LED lights, meanwhile, flash and ripple with the movements of a viewer, and scent glands emit \"musky, ginger-like\" odors that, like a flower, lure people in as they draw near. An Arduino circuit board ties everything together, recording and looping the various actions to create a \"store of memory,\" like a very primordial brain. According to Beesley, Radiant Soil is more than a theoretical exercise; it's a step toward a new, more immersive paradigm of architectural language.\nAll images provided courtesy of Radiant Soil, Espace EDF Paris, France, 2013 Â©PBAI.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nClusters of interlinked LED lights emit bright flashes and ripples as viewers pass through the space.\nA view of Radiant Soil's \"canopy.\" By enveloping the viewer in a forest-like space of synthetic yet responsive materials, Beesley seeks to challenge Western, inorganic traditions of architecture. \"The layers are deeply worked and have their own dynamics, where we navigate and perhaps negotiate with the environment.\"\n\"Perhaps there's something really vital in the sense of mold, or decay, or renewal, or vitality that points to fertility as a way of conceiving of architecture,\" Beesley says. \"And that implies a more diffusive form language, in which structures reach out and are open, as opposed to closed, hard minimalism.\"\nThe entire system is interconnected, with every movement and reaction triggering a chain of actions throughout. \"That\u2019s one of the things I really enjoy about this system,\" the artist explains. \"It contains some really simple things, things that are tangible, like a light softly glowing and moving on and off, or a chain of things happening, like a domino chain, one after the other... Those individual, simple, concurrent actions build up into chorus-like hives and swarms of behavior.\"\nGoing forward, Beesley hopes to incorporate more advanced learning technologies into Radiant Soil, which would allow the system to adapt and respond to human behavior with even greater fluidity and intelligence.\n\"The work is radically synthetic,\" Beesley says. \"I don't consider it particularly naturalistic. It's more the involvement of being in the wilderness \u2014 the states of flux and instability \u2014 that this work starts to acquire.\"\nBeesley situates Radiant Soil within a broader \"new paradigm\" of responsive architecture, where structures and humans engage in a more fluid form of symbiosis. \"While the active systems of this architecture give us shelter and spin around us, they\u2019re also harvesting off of us, and wanting us to come to them,\" he says. \"That sets up a mutual relationship of exchange, if not a more animal-based relationship.\"\n\"The work is radically synthetic,\" Beesley says. \"I don't consider it particularly naturalistic.

It can go through a set of transitions, and fade, and extinguish and arise again,\" he says. \"That kind of participation in something which is almost a counter-form to the eternal, a kind of relishing of mortality, produces a festive, rather poignant role for architecture.\"\nRadiant Soil is on display as part of the ALIVE \/ EN VIE exhibition at the EDF Fondation in Paris through September 1st.\n","Title":"The living architecture of Philip Beesley | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","design","architecture"]}
