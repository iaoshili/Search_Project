{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is getting serious about its fitness band. After  launching the wrist-worn accessory in October , Microsoft is now expanding on its availability both in the US and overseas. In the coming weeks, Microsoft is planning to \"ramp up\" the inventory of the Microsoft Band in stores and online in the US. Part of these increased shipments will include a new expansion in the US to Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. \"Microsoft has a long history of partnering with these retailers and we are pleased to welcome them on this journey with us,\" says Matt Barlow, Microsoft\u2019s general manager of new devices. \"They will begin selling product today, with increased shipments planned for the weeks and months ahead.\"\nAlongside the US expansion, Microsoft is also bringing the Band to the UK. Microsoft estimates that around 7 million people are already using fitness wearables in the UK, and with that set to increase this \"makes the UK a natural step for the introduction of Microsoft Health and Microsoft Band.\" The Microsoft Band isn\u2019t arriving in the UK immediately, but pre-orders start today via  the Microsoft Store for £169.99. It will also be available at Amazon, Currys, PC World, Dixons Travel, Harrods, and O2 stores on April 15th.\nMicrosoft Band hands-on\n","Title":"Microsoft Band now available on Amazon, arriving in UK on April 15th | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
