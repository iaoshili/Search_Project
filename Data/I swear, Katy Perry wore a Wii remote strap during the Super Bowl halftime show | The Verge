{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMissy Elliott's Super Bowl halftime show was amazing, introduced by Katy Perry riding a large polygonal tiger. For the final song, which went back to Perry for \"Firework,\" the songstress had to make extra sure she didn't drop the mic as she was floated over the field \u2014 and apparently that means using a Wii remote strap, i.e. that safety precaution Nintendo gave you to avoid throwing your controller into a TV while playing virtual tennis or whatever.\nAt least, it looks like a Wii remote strap, and I'm not the only one who thought so. Cue the tweetstorm:\nKaty Perry\u2019s mic has a Wii strap! #Superbowl\n\u2014 Joshua Malina (@JoshMalina) February 2, 2015\nBack to Katy Perry, who LITERALLY HAS A WII REMOTE STRAP ON HER WRIST\n\u2014 Ross Miller (@ohnorosco) February 2, 2015\nKaty Perry I feel like you should concentrate on your show and not on playing the wii right now... pic.twitter.com\/9HelLbds6t\n\u2014 Emily Osment (@EmilyOsment) February 2, 2015\nIS THAT A WII CONTROLLER\n\u2014 Jack Barakat (@JackAllTimeLow) February 2, 2015\nKaty singing into a wii-mote #SuperBowI pic.twitter.com\/MiCpDgpl8y\n\u2014 Nick Tangorra (@nicktangorra) February 2, 2015\nKaty Perry rocking the Wii safety strap during the halftime show. #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com\/rWBoMfdWc2\n\u2014 Funny Or Die (@funnyordie) February 2, 2015\nKaty Perry wants to be Emboar so bad pic.twitter.com\/WQqIKNgOOO\n","Title":"I swear, Katy Perry wore a Wii remote strap during the Super Bowl halftime show | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7724752"]}
