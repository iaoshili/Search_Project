{"Main text":"40 Comments\nThis weekend Clint Eastwood\u2019s adaption of the musical Jersey Boys is hitting theaters. Reviews haven\u2019t been kind thus far, so if you\u2019re looking for another option you might want to check out David Michod\u2019s dystopian drama The Rover, instead. (There\u2019s also Edge of Tomorrow if you want a little more sci-fi in your weekend.)\nOf course, it\u2019s all prelude to next weekend when Michael Bay and a whole lot of robots return in Transformers: Age of Extinction. What else is on the way? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nThe Judge\nLately we\u2019ve grown accustomed to seeing Robert Downey Jr. and his brand of snarky smarts in comedies and superhero movies \u2014 but in this new film from director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) he\u2019s stretching his dramatic muscles. He plays a smarmy attorney who finds himself in the position of defending his father (Robert Duvall) from a murder charge. Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, Vera Farmiga, and a particularly slick Billy Bob Thornton round out the cast.\nThe Knick\nSteven Soderbergh claimed he was going to retire from filmmaking altogether, but it didn\u2019t take him long to start walking that statement back. That\u2019s a good thing for audiences, because this trailer for his new Cinemax series The Knick looks absolutely amazing. Set in New York in the early 1900s, it stars Clive Owen as a doctor working at the Knickerbocker hospital \u2014 and it premieres on August 8th.\nAnimal\nThis trailer actually debuted a few weeks ago, but we\u2019re a sucker for a good Kids Go To The Woods To Get Up To No Good Only To Have A Horrible Killer \/ Creature \/ Demonic Force Get In Their Way teaser. Joey Lauren Adams (Chasing Amy, Dazed and Confused) stars alongside a creepy monster and a slew of metal guitar riffs.\nDear White People\nWe absolutely adored Justin Simien\u2019s debut feature when we saw it at Sundance earlier this year. A social satire set on a fictional Ivy League campus, it\u2019s smart, daring, and hilarious all at the same time. Simien is a filmmaker you\u2019ll want to watch closely, and you can see Dear White People for yourself when it opens on October 17th.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'The Judge,' 'The Knick,' 'Animal,' and 'Dear White People' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
