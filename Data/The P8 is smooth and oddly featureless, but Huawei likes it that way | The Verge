{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere\u2019s no place for subtlety in the smartphone market. Huawei proved this yesterday at the London launch of its new P8 and P8 Max handsets. The Chinese manufacturer was insistent that its new phones were the best, the biggest, the thinnest, and the fastest: the most this and the least that. They\u2019re everything a sane and rational consumer could ask for \u2014 except, of course, they\u2019re not. Not right now anyway.\nFive years ago, Huawei was unheard of in consumer electronics, now it\u2019s the fourth-biggest smartphone seller in the world, and it wants to be big in the West, too. To achieve this, it\u2019s been pumping out a series of high-end flagships to grab attention, cramming in feature after feature in a faintly manic fashion. The launch event in London was exemplary of this, bombarding the visiting press with stat after stat, and so many promo videos that it felt like Huawei had put an open call for them, received half a dozen entries, and then just thought, \"Fine, whatever, let\u2019s use them all.\"\nHuawei didn't know when to stop\nThere was one video of blindfolded actors feeling up the P8 before taking off their blindfolds to offer insightful comments like \"It\u2019s got a camera on it which is nice, so I can use it for everything.\" In another clip, a hooded model strolled around a city, using his P8 to suck the light out of street lamps and car headlights like an evil Dumbledore going mad with his Deluminator. Another video had  a backing song that started with the line: \"It takes a moment to break a butterfly \/ on a wheel that\u2019s when you hear an angel cry.\" Basically, it felt like Huawei just didn\u2019t know when to stop.\nWhen it comes to its phones, this isn\u2019t such a bad thing. Both the P8 and P8 Max are competent enough devices, at least on paper. They boast FHD screens (5.2 inches and 6.8 inches respectively; sharp, but not as good as the Quad HD displays you get on most flagships these days), 13-megapixel cameras, 64-bit eight-core processors, and 3GB of RAM apiece. In addition, they both feel solidly made, with smooth aluminum unibodies and sharp, chamfered edges. Huawei\u2019s attempt to skin Android is as unsuccessful as most Android skins (although its muted color scheme stands out as a notable turn-off), but the phone is at least capably fast.\nThe problem is that Huawei doesn\u2019t seem to know where to focus. The phones themselves definitely have a few neat touches, but they get lost in the blur. There\u2019s a remote voice activation feature that lets you shout at your handset when you\u2019ve lost it and it\u2019ll start ringing, and a fantastically named \"knuckle sense technology\" which senses (you guessed it) knuckles, letting users take a screenshot by knocking twice on the display.\nThe P8 feels competent but soulless\nAt the moment, Huawei\u2019s phones still feel a bit soulless, like they\u2019re not really the company\u2019s own. One of the other myriad promo videos at the event went into the manufacturing processes behind the P8 (each handset takes 810 minutes of \"pure commitment\" to be milled apparently), with this footage spliced with designers talking vaguely about luxury craftsmanship and the like. It was a fairly straight rip-off of an Apple segment two years ago, and while this isn\u2019t at all shameful (it\u2019s too common to be shameful), it\u2019s not inspirational. The same, unfortunately, is true of the P8.\nThe P8 goes on sale in May, followed by the P8 Max the month after, with prices starting at \u20AC499 ($537) and \u20AC549 ($591), respectively.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe P8 has a 5.2-inch display with a 1080 x 1920 resolution.\nThe bezels aren't as skinny as they appear in promo images, but they're thin enough.\nThe picture quality is bright and sharp, although not as good as Quad HD displays.\nIt's skinned with Huawei's Emotion 3.1 UI, which is mostly harmless, but we still prefer stock Android.\nThe edges on the P8 are a lot sharper than those on the iPhone 6, but it feels comfortable in the hand.\nThe rear has a smooth feel to it. Huawei has managed to avoid sticking a camera bump on the back \u2014 unlike Samsung and Apple.\nThe bottom of the phone has the standard MicroUSB-and-speakers combo.\nThe power button and volume rocker. The phone's screen is oddly slow to turn on.\nThis edge has two slots \u2014 you can use both for SIM cards, or one for a SIM card and one for a microSD card.\nThe iPhone 6 and the Huawei P8.\nVery similar. The P8's headphone port is on the top of the phone though.\nThe white plastic bands on both the iPhone 6 and P8 are for the antennas.\nSpeaker grille and front-facing 8-megapixel camera.\n","Title":"The P8 is smooth and oddly featureless, but Huawei likes it that way | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","hands--on","photo-essay","tech"]}
