Thanks to a new collaboration, we're getting a taste of what happens when the two meet.\nThe UK Gold, an upcoming documentary about tax avoidance in the UK,Â  features a score from Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja and Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke, along with guests including Yorke's bandmate Jonny Greenwood. That soundtrack's now streaming and sounds something like Nine Inch Nails meets a silent film orchestra. Give the tunes a spin below, and see the trailer for the film above.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
