{"Main text":"Samsung is making a musical sitcom about how cool it is to work there\nCan you sing the company anthem?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKorean dramas are becoming a worldwide phenomenon, and it looks like Samsung is cashing in on their popularity.  As spotted by Business Insider , upcoming \"musicom\" Best Future will explore young people's dreams and challenges over the course of six 10-minute long episodes. The gorgeous cast will also be performing covers of popular '80s and '90s tunes.\nIn order to portray the \"real\" Samsung, the series will be shot at company offices in both Seoul and Suwon Digital City. The idea behind Best Future is to weave a tale about work, life, and relationships that those in their 20s and 30s can sympathize with, and to tempt prospective employees into working with Samsung. Amazingly, this is actually the company's second foray into the world of sitcoms, the previous being an attempt to showcase the technology giant's recruiting ideologies.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
