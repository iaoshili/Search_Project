{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSince Sony Pictures now  shares the license for the upcoming Spider-Man movies with Marvel Studios, it must have been on the look out for comic book properties to build its next crop of blockbusters. Now things are back on track;  Sony this week managed to sign a five-movie deal with young comics publisher Valiant Entertainment, promising movies based on the Bloodshot and Harbinger titles, which are slated to hit theaters starting in 2017.\nWe heard you wanted a franchise\nThe first film in the series will be Bloodshot, which follows a shape-shifting super soldier brought back from the dead with the power of nanomachines. John Wick directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski are currently attached to direct, with Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn producing. Next up is the currently director-less Harbinger, which focuses on psychic runaway Peter Stanchek and his conflict with the shadowy Harbinger Foundation. Both films will get sequels before they collide Avengers-style in Harbinger Wars.\nWhile Valiant may lack the mainstream cachet conferred on Marvel and DC these days, the company has at least one serious bona fide to its name\u2014 something Sony may have noticed. It was founded back in 1992 by former Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter, who oversaw one of the most creatively influential periods at Marvel during the 1970s and '80s. Both Bloodshot and Harbinger are action-packed enough to make for entertaining popcorn movies. Whether or not they'll be good, though, is still an open question.\n","Title":"Sony finds its new comic book universe with Valiant Entertainment | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film","comics"]}
