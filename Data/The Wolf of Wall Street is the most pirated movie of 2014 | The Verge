Already a success by any measure, the film now has the extra distinction of being the most pirated movie of 2014.  According to Variety , the Leonardo DiCaprio-helmed biopic was downloaded more than 30 million times over the course of the year.\nThe competition for the top spot was fairly close among the top 20 most pirated movies, though. According to piracy tracking firm Excipio, Disney's Frozen trailed close behind Wolf with just over 29.9 million downloads, while RoboCop and Gravity take the third and fourth spots on the list, respectively. However, these numbers all blow away previous piracy numbers by a long shot.
