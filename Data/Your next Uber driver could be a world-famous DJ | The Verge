{"Main text":"Your next Uber driver could be a world-famous DJ\n(If you live in Toronto, that is)\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPerhaps in an effort to make some extra money to support his legal battle with Disney , EDM superstar deadmau5 broke in his brand new \"Meowclaren\" supercar by prowling the streets of Toronto as an Uber driver. After making a passing reference to signing up for the service just a week ago, the DJ picked up a couple of fares, including one fan who needed a ride to Chipotle .\nAccording to the mau5 himself, he's game to do this again, so Uber users in Toronto should keep their eyes peeled. It's not the same as getting a ride in the \"Purrari\" we saw at the Gumball 3000 back in June, but we definitely wouldn't mind taking a spin.\nlol, well that was fun... gunna keep the app handy... never know when i get bored n might wanna go out for a spin. thanks @Uber_TOR\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
