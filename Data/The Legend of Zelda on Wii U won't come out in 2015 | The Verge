{"Main text":"The Legend of Zelda on Wii U won't come out in 2015\nEverything beautiful is a lie\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn a video posted to Facebook , Nintendo's producer for The Legend of Zelda has announced that contrary to what we all expected , the Wii U version of the game won't make it out in 2015. \"We are not longer making a 2015 release our number one priority,\"Â Eiji Aonuma said. The game is designed to take Link into a more open world, and apparently the team creating the game needs more time to create that world.\nSaying that \"we have discovered several new possibilities for this game,\" Aonuma says the team wants to explore them and create something even better. Rather than fit a schedule, the team wants to create the right game. Sure, okay, that's as it should be, but it's also a huge bummer.\nFirst a live-action Zelda TV series for Netflix was teased , and then cruelly ripped away from us (despite our expert casting suggestions ).\nNow this.\nKotaku , where we first saw the news, couldn't bring itself to comment on the news immediately. I understand why: it's an unimaginable tragedy that rightfully will leave all Wii U fans inconsolable. My Wii U controller has a triforce logo on it and there's only so much Wind Waker that I \u2014 or any human \u2014 can reasonably play. I cannot adequately express my disappointment. This Linkstagram will have to do .\nthat triforce quest tho pic.twitter.com\/X3COGbKns4\n","Title":"The Legend of Zelda on Wii U won't come out in 2015 | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
