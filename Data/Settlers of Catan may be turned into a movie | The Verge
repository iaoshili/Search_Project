{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBoard games typically have little to no actual story, and when it comes to German-style boardgames, they rarely even have exciting themes. Which is why it's surprising, wonderful, and a little crazy that Gail Katz, the producer behind The Perfect Storm, has  picked up the movie and TV rights to The Settlers of Catan, a game about trading sheep for stones.\nWill anyone trade me some brick? No? Okay.\nCatan is obviously a breakout hit and one of the hottest board games around today, so Katz's interest in the property makes enough sense. It's a strange purchase in that Catan has no real story \u2014 it just provides the generic setup of exploring and settling a new island \u2014 but that may be part of the appeal. Like in the film adaptation of Battleship, the lack of any story in the source material basically gives the filmmakers room to do whatever they want and then slap a well-known name on the front of it, which is good for selling tickets.\nSomehow, this isn't even the first time that Catan has been taken into another medium: there's actually already a novelization. It's super long, and \u2014 based on a cursory look through it one time while I was at the Strand \u2014 I'm pretty sure that it has little to do with the board game.\nThough Katz has purchased film and TV rights to Catan, that's no guarantee that anything will be made. This is step one in what is often a very long process of getting a movie made, and a lot of other people are going to need to get on board for a movie or show to move forward.\nReally though, brick or wood would be great right now\n\"The island of Catan is a vivid, visual, exciting and timeless world with classic themes and moral challenges that resonate today,\" Katz says in a statement,  according to Deadline . \"There is a tremendous opportunity to take what people love about the game and its mythology as a starting point for the narrative.\" Presumably, that means the movie will have something to do with a large army battling a neighboring city with extremely long roads. We're looking forward to it.\n","Title":"Settlers of Catan may be turned into a movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
