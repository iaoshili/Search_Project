{"Main text":"Woman in her twenties discovers that she was born without a cerebellum\nShe found out when she checked herself into the hospital because of a bad case of nausea\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA woman living in China\u2019s Shandong Province got a bit of a surprise recently when doctors at the Chinese PLA General Hospital told her that her brain was missing one of the most important centers for motor control: the cerebellum. She had initially checked herself into the hospital because of a bad case of dizziness and nausea, New Scientist reports .\nOnly nine other such cases in the world, and most died early on\nThe cerebellum is a small portion of the brain located at the back of the skull. But don\u2019t be fooled by its size; it actually contains half of the brain\u2019s neurons. And, unsurprisingly, having a missing cerebellum \u2014 cerebrospinal fluid was found in its place \u2014 caused quite a few problems for this woman over the course of her life. For one thing, her speech was slurred until age six, and she only began to walk at age seven. Moreover, she has had trouble maintaining her balance her entire life.\nThere have only been nine other such cases in the world and most died early on, so the fact that this woman has made it to adulthood \u2013 and is doing reasonably well \u2014 is pretty astounding. Doctors will undoubtedly want to study her further to find out how her brain adapted to the exclusion so quickly (it\u2019s likely that the cortex took over for the missing mass). The results of her initial examination, however, are already available in the journal Brain .\nICYMI: Detours, Episode 2 - Boston Children's Hospital and 3-D Printed Brains\n","Title":"Woman in her twenties discovers that she was born without a cerebellum | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
