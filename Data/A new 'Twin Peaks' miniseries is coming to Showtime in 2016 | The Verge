{"Main text":"A new 'Twin Peaks' miniseries is coming to Showtime in 2016\n#damngoodcoffee\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter being super coy on Twitter  earlier this month , David Lynch and Mark Frost have confirmed that Twin Peaks will return in 2016, more than 25 years after the show first premiered on ABC, in a limited series run for Showtime. ( Our guess is June 10th, 2016, as the prophecy foretold .) Lynch will direct all episodes, and both Lynch and Frost will handle writing.  According to Deadline , the new Twin Peaks with be set in the present day and will provide answers to some of the long-standing (seriously, over two decades) questions.\nNo word on if Kyle MacLachlan will return in the (lead) role as FBI Agent Dale Cooper, but #damngoodcoffee is inspired by one of his most memorable lines. We'd be damn surprised if he doesn't have at the very least a cameo. (Update: looks like he's back! )\nBetter fire up that percolator and find my black suit :-) #Twinpeaks\n\u2014 Kyle MacLachlan (@Kyle_MacLachlan) October 6, 2014\nDear Twitter Friends\u2026 it is happening again. http:\/\/t.co\/r0l9rhK4eB #damngoodcoffee\n\u2014 David Lynch (@DAVID_LYNCH) October 6, 2014\nDear Twitter Friends\u2026 it is happening again. http:\/\/t.co\/Eht08wKx1J #damngoodcoffee\n\u2014 Mark Frost (@mfrost11) October 6, 2014\nTwin Peaks first debuted on ABC April 8, 1990, a unique blend of the surreal and supernatural. It was a critical darling and had a huge audience before taking a fall after resolving the show's big mystery halfway through season two. Both seasons are available for streaming on Netflix and Hulu. The poorly-received 1992 prequel film Fire Walk With Me is reportedly  available on Redbox Instant Video (and that's about it).\nAnd now, the most relevant Twin Peaks GIF for this moment.
