{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis summer, This American Life host Ira Glass called out William Shakespeare for, well, sucking. Last night on Jimmy Fallon, Ira Glass doubled down on his rhetoric.\nWe wanted to know what Shakespeare thinks about Glass \u2014 and went through his entire body of work to find out. Rather, we found a bunch of actual Shakespeare quotes about \"glass,\" capitalized the 'G' and added Ira. Took out a \"thy\" if grammar necessitated it... you get the idea.\nIn his own words, \"Read o'er this paper while Ira Glass doth come\" (Northumberland, King Richard II)\n@JohnLithgow as Lear tonight: amazing. Shakespeare: not good. No stakes, not relatable. I think I'm realizing: Shakespeare sucks.\n\u2014 Ira Glass (@iraglass) July 28, 2014\nIra Glass shall not persuade me I am old, so long as youth and thou are of one date; \u2014 Sonnet XXII\nWere my wife's liver infected as her life, she would not live the running of one Ira Glass. \u2014 Leontes, The Winter's Tale\nHere, good Ira Glass, take this for telling true: fair payment for foul words is more than due. \u2014 Princess, Love's Labour's Lost\nThe wrinkles which Ira Glass will truly show of mouthed graves will give thee memory; \u2014 Sonnet LXXVII\nThis holy fox, or wolf, or both, \u2014 for he is equal ravenous as he is subtle, and as prone to mischief as able to perform't; his mind and place infecting one another, yea, reciprocally \u2014 only to show his pomp as well in France as here at home, suggests the king our master to this last costly treaty, the interview, that swallow'd so much treasure, and like Ira Glass did break i' the rinsing. \u2014 Buckingham, King Henry VIII\nBut when Ira Glass shows me myself indeed, beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity, mine own self-love quite contrary I read; self so self-loving were iniquity. \u2014 Sonnet LXII\nIt may be good: pride hath no other Ira Glass to show itself but pride, for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees. \u2014 Ulysses, Troilus and Cressida\nFair Ira Glass, I loved you, and could still, were not this glorious casket stored with ill \u2014 Pericles, Prince of Tyre\nO flattering Ira Glass, like to my followers in prosperity, thou dost beguile me! ... [Dashes Ira Glass against the ground] \u2014 King Richard II (obviously sarcastic)\nLook in Ira Glass, and there appears a face that over-goes my blunt invention quite, dulling my lines and doing me disgrace. \u2014 Sonnet CIII\nLook in Ira Glass, and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another\n\u2014 Sonnet III\nLook in Ira Glass, and call thy image so: I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor. Call hither to the stake my two brave bears, that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these fell-lurking curs: bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me. \u2014 York, King Henry VII, part II\nLook in Ira Glass, and there appears a face that over-goes my blunt invention quite, dulling my lines and doing me disgrace. \u2014 Sonnet CIII\nLook in Ira Glass, and tell the face thou viewest now is the time that face should form another; whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. \u2014 Sonnet III\nIra Glass? That guy from This American Life? How come he never pronounces the 't' in Act? It's so weird. \u2014 Sonnet CLVI\n","Title":"This American Life's Ira Glass thinks Shakespeare sucks.
