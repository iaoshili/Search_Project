{"Main text":"Watch Chance the Rapper's nostalgic music video for Sunday Candy\nThe song comes off the upcoming mixtape Surf\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChicago rap wunderkind Chance the Rapper hasn't dropped any solo releases since 2013's truly great mixtape  Acid Rap , but he's working on a collaborative album with the musician Donnie Trumpet, who plays in Chance's live band, the Social Experiment. That album is called Surf, and one of its first singles was \"Sunday Candy,\" a jazzy, jittery song featuring that classic Chance yalp and a hummable chorus from Jamila Woods.\nMusical candy for your Sunday\nThe song is big and optimistic, almost like a Broadway number, so it makes sense that its visual nods to musical theater. The video, labeled a \"short film,\" was directed by Austin Vesely, Ian Eastwood, and Chance himself. It features a '50s-style candy shop(pe), suspenders, White Sox varsity jackets, and some really great choreographed dance moves. Also, I don't know if you realized this, but today is also Sunday.
