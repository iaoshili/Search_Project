{"Main text":"Download a new Aphex Twin track before his EP drops tomorrow\nA taste of Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt. 2\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRichard D. James, aka Aphex Twin, has cleared  his SoundCloud entirely, except for one new track that surfaced today. The track appears to be a mix of the opening single on Aphex Twin's upcoming EP, Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt. 2, out tomorrow on Warp. \"Diskhat ALL Prepared1mixed [snr2mix]\" builds from a slow-burning industrial clatter, layering in a queasy bassline, slivers of ominous chimes, and nihilistically chopped percussion.\nLast year's  Syro was Aphex Twin's first release since 2001's Drukqs, but now it's starting to feel like the hiatus is definitively over. Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt. 2 comes just a few months after Syro, and contains 13 new tracks (even if a few of them are under 30 seconds \u2014 see the full tracklist below).\nIf the download above isn't enough Aphex for you, check out our  everything-RDJ Verge playlist .\nComputer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt. 2 tracklist:\n01. diskhat ALL prepared1mixed 13 (5:22)\n02. snar2 (0:19)\n04. piano un1 arpej (0:50)\n05.
