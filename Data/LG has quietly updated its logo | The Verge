{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLG's so busy pushing its brand into as many electronics categories as possible that it seems the company has forgotten to announce a subtle change in the brand itself. The G in \"LG\" has lost its familiar serif and taken on a more modern appearance. The L is also taller and less square than it previously was, though the red circle integrating both initials into a smiling face appears to have been left untouched. The new G Flex 2 smartphone features the updated LG insignia, which is where our eagle-eyed Chris Ziegler first spotted the change, though you'll also find the refreshed LG look on lg.com , at the company's CES press conference and materials, and even on the note cards used by its speakers during the presentation.\nFor a direct comparison against the old LG logo, check out our image slider below: on the left is the new brand while on the right is a shot from LG's booth during CES 2013.\nUpdate: Thanks to reader jinhyuklee for pointing out that Korean media covered LG's logo switch at the end of December. An LG spokesman, quoted by The Korea Times , says that the change \"will help boost brand identity, readability and usability.\" All public-facing insignia will be affected and employees will apparently all get new business cards. LG has also responded to The Verge's enquiry, confirming that it only just made the change in logo.\n","Title":"LG has quietly updated its logo | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
