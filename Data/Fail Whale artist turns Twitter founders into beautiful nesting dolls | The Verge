{"Main text":"Fail Whale artist turns Twitter founders into beautiful nesting dolls\nReal world toys inspired by the virtual realm\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYiying Lu, the author of Twitter's famously adorable Fail Whale graphic , is returning to the site of her greatest success with a new set of matryoshka dolls that celebrates both the founders and users of the world's favorite 140-character social network. The handcrafted #NestingTwitter figurines include current Twitter CEO Dick Costolo and its originators Biz Stone and Jack Dorsey, but the outermost doll is reserved for the user community as a whole. Neat little adornments like @, reply, and retweet symbols decorate the wooden dolls \u2014 though you won't find Twitter's official logo anywhere since this project isn't affiliated with the company itself.\nLaunching on Kickstarter today , the project requires $30,000 to get off the ground and is already more than a tenth of its way to that goal. Given Twitter's widespread popularity and the undeniable charm of these dolls, reaching the necessary funding doesn't seem like it'll be a problem. And to distinguish your set from all the others, you can even get your Twitter handle and your favorite tweet inscribed at the bottom of the community doll.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
