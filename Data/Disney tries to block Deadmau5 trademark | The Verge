{"Main text":"Disney tries to block Deadmau5 trademark\n\"Lawyer up, Mickey.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDisney doesn't want Deadmau5 to be able to trademark his iconic mouse logo because it's too similar to Mickey Mouse.Â  TMZ reports that Disney has filed to block Deadmau5's trademark in the US, which the electronic musician otherwise known as Joel Zimmerman applied for last year. According to his attorney, he has trademarked the design in over 30 countries including the UK, Japan, and Germany.\nThe logo appears on Deadmau5's record artwork and is the basis of the large helmet he wears during every performance. Disney began investigating the matter back in April, and it's easy to see why \u2014 there is an obvious resemblance with the Mickey Mouse logo, and since the registration would cover classes of products from toys to BMX bikes, the entertainment giant no doubt feels the need to protect its trademark. Deadmau5 seems up for the fight, though, going by his Twitter feed.\nlanded home to some interesting news: looks like Disney officially just filed in opposition of my trademark... lawyer up mickey.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
