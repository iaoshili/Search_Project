{"Main text":"US & World\nControversial Missouri execution delayed after Supreme Court intervenes\nAmid controversy over lethal injection drugs, a convicted killer had until midnight to argue that his death would be cruel and unusual\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUpdate, May 21st, 12:10AM ET: A US Supreme Court Justice has issued an order halting the execution of Russell Bucklew. Justice Samuel Alito issued the order shortly after the a full panel of judges from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which had granted Bucklew a stay of execution  a few hours earlier , reversed its decision. The stay of execution had been issued by a smaller panel of three appeals court judges. Alito has yet to explain why he intervened to stop the execution.\nBy the afternoon of March 21st, 1996, Russell Bucklew was in a jealous rage. The 27-year-old stole two pistols, two sets of handcuffs, and a roll of Duct tape and headed to the trailer where his ex-girlfriend, her new boyfriend, and the boyfriend\u2019s children were staying. Bucklew shot the boyfriend, killing him. Then he fired a shot at one of the children \u2014 fortunately missing the boy \u2014 before kidnapping his ex, driving away with her, and raping her. At trial a year later he would argue that his eventual confession to investigators was unfairly coerced. But he would never deny that he did what he was convicted of \u2014 and sentenced to death for doing. As his lawyer told The Verge this morning, \"Mr. Bucklew has always accepted the consequences of his actions. Nor has he ever claimed innocence.\"\nBut today, his lawyers are nonetheless struggling to save Bucklew\u2019s life.\nTonight, at a minute after midnight Central Daylight Time, Bucklew is scheduled to be executed via lethal injection by the State of Missouri. Though no one\u2019s arguing that Bucklew is a great and magnanimous man, his lawyers argue that Missouri\u2019s lethal injection policies could cause Bucklew to die in a cruel and unusual way.\nLawyers are struggling to save a killer\u2019s life\nLate last month, Oklahoma prisoner Clayton Lockett was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1999 murder of a 19-year-old woman. When an execution drug failed to kill him \u2014 the result of a vein collapse and a shortage of lethal injection drugs available to doctors at the execution \u2014 Lockett died of a heart attack on a gurney 43 minutes after his execution began .\nLawyers are hoping to stave off a similar fate for Bucklew.\nAs pharmaceutical companies have backed away from having their drugs used to carry out state killings , states such as Missouri have faced a shortage of the drugs it uses to execute state prisoners. Missouri \u2014 which has had a troubling history of fiascoes related to its execution policies \u2014 and other states have thus called upon compounding pharmacies to create generic pharmaceuticals that will mimic the effects of drugs such as Nembutal, which kill prisoners through sedation. But Missouri has failed to disclose the chemical makeup of those drugs, forcing media organizations such as the Associated Press to file a First Amendment lawsuit so that the makeup of those drugs will be public. Lawyers, including Bucklew's representative Lindsay Runnels, argue that executions should be halted until such information is freely available.\n\"As we saw in Clayton Lockett\u2019s case,\" Runnels tells The Verge, \"whenever someone struggles to breathe while they\u2019re being executed, it\u2019s cruel and unusual and in violation of the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution . Fundamentally, we can\u2019t allow that to happen.\"\nFurther complicating things, according to Bucklew\u2019s lawyer, is the man\u2019s health.\nDr. Joel B. Zivot, an assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery and Emory University's School of Medicine, examined Bucklew earlier this month. Detailing what he found in a signed affidavit , he writes that Bucklew suffers from extreme hypertension and that a \"very large vascular mass \u2026 distorts the anatomy of Mr. Bucklew's airway.\" When Bucklew is strapped down to a gurney \u2014 as is protocol when someone faces lethal injection \u2014 there\u2019s a very good possibility he won\u2019t be able to breathe, the affidavit states. The concern, Zivot writes, is that Bucklew will suffocate before the lethal injection drug can kill him.\nBucklew could experience excruciating pain\n\"The bottom line\" in Bucklew\u2019s case, Zivot writes, \"is that there is no way to proceed with Mr. Bucklew's execution without a substantial risk to Mr. Bucklew of suffering grave adverse events during the execution, including hemorrhaging, suffocating, or experiencing excruciating pain.\"\nBucklew\u2019s legal team filed a motion last week to delay the execution \u2014 and to film it if it occurs tonight. The filming needs to occur, they write, in case Bucklew \"survives the execution and needs the taped evidence to oppose another attempt to execute him\"; in case he \"suffers injury and needs the evidence in support of any legal claims for damages\"; or in case he \"suffers a prolonged and excruciating execution or chokes and suffocates to death, and the evidence is relevant to a legal claim brought in the name of his estate.\"\nThat hasn\u2019t gotten them far. The lawyers filed a new motion today , hoping to stay Bucklew\u2019s execution. But as of now Missouri\u2019s governor plans to let it commence without cameras.\n","Title":"Controversial Missouri execution delayed after Supreme Court intervenes | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
