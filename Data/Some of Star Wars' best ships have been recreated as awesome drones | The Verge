{"Main text":"Some of Star Wars' best ships have been recreated as awesome drones\nThese are the drones you're looking for\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month we saw a Millennium Falcon-inspired drone , and today we get footage of a quadcopter modded to look like the Speeder Bike from Return of the Jedi. By the time Disney releases the new Star Wars film, we may have an entire galactic fleet.\nThe Speeder Bike, shown above, is the creation of Google hardware engineer Adam Woodworth, who took a 12-inch Hasbro toy and designed a custom rotor layout that retains the general look, while still providing enough lift. Woodworth wrote a detailed explanation of his process, and included a number of  helpful photos showing his work at Make .\nAlong with aesthetic modifications, Star Wars has also, in some part, inspired the drone racing community, documented in the following videos. The first video features our own Ben Popper.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
