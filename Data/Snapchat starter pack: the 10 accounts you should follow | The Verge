If you've been on the platform for a while, you're probably tired of seeing the same few friends post snaps of their pets.\nWe recently asked our readers for their favorite Snapchat accounts. We received dozens of great recommendations. The following list isn't comprised of the best Snapchat accounts; instead, these are some of the strangest, funniest, and most controversial people and #brands on the platform. On Snapchat, these accounts are setting the tone.\nNote: we don\u2019t condone any of the activity you may be exposed to by following these accounts.\nSnapchat\ncaseyneistat\nCasey Neistat is perhaps known best for  snowboarding through the streets of Manhattan . Or maybe it's his  great take on Google Glass. Or any other of his  YouTube videos. If you don't know him, you should \u2014 he's one of the best storytellers the social media world has.\nTumblr\nmiologie\nChristine Mi\u2019s Snapchat is full of selfies, but it\u2019s cooler than you think. She deftly draws herself into famous scenes \u2014 whether recreating Van Gogh\u2019s \"Self Portrait,\" taking over as Link in The Legend of Zelda, or popping up in Monsters, Inc.\nTwitter\ntacobell\nSure, the point of Taco Bell's Snapchat account is probably to make sure teens eat there. And that's fine; Taco Bell is pretty great. However, Taco Bell takes advantage of its brand by creating interactive and detailed stories about love, romance, and of course, new menu items.\nHyperallergic\nlacma_museum\nThis account obviously started with a very simple premise: How do you make fine art accessible to #teens? And we have to say, they\u2019ve done an amazing job superimposing memes and lyrics onto very staid artwork for full comedic effect.\nSnapchat\nrackeddotcom\nOur sister site Racked \u2014 all things fashion and shopping \u2014 just relaunched, and the site looks beautiful.  You should check it out .

So far, it\u2019s mostly been hanging out with their cartoonists \u2014 but if all they ever do is ask George Booth and Sam Gross to illustrate adorable animals live for Snapchat, we\u2019re okay with it.\nMashable\nmashable\nMashable is a website about a lot of things \u2014 social media, tech, business, and more \u2014 and so is its Snapchat account. Mashable brings you on the red carpet, to various events and trade shows, to museums, and inside its offices.
