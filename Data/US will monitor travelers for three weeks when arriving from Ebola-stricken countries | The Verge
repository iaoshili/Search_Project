As was previously announced, travelers will also be  required to go through one of just five airports that will pass them through an enhanced screening process.\n\"The bottom line is that we have to keep our guard against Ebola.\"\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the new regulations on a call Wednesday morning. According to Time, monitored travelers will be given kits that help track their temperature, with instructions to update officials daily. Travelers will reportedly also have to provide two phone numbers, two email addresses, a home address, and whatever address they'll be reachable at over the next three weeks, as well as that same information for a friend or family member of theirs. They must also report any travel plans and coordinate with the CDC on how they will continue to report their status.\nThe more rigorous monitoring comes amid growing and arguably exaggerated concerns over the potential for Ebola to spread within the United States. \"The bottom line is that we have to keep our guard against Ebola,\" says CDC director Tom Frieden,  according to the Associated Press . So far, only three cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the US. The total cases worldwide is believed to be at over 9,000, with Liberia and Sierra Leone the most affected areas.\n","Title":"US will monitor travelers for three weeks when arriving from Ebola-stricken countries | The Verge","Tags":["policy","science","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
