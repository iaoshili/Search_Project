{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCES may not be a big camera show, but that didn't stop Canon from announcing a whole bunch of new cameras. The company just unveiled five digital shooters, with a focus on cameras that can connect to all of the other devices in your life through things like Wi-Fi and NFC. On the higher end of the spectrum is the new PowerShot SX530 HS \u2014 a refresh of the SX520 \u2014 which features a 50x optical zoom lens, a 16-megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor, and the ability to record 1080p HD video, all for the tidy sum of $429.99.\nPowerShot SX710 HS\nThere's also the PowerShot SX710 HS, an update to the SX700, with a 30x optical zoom lens and 20.3-megapixel high-sensitivity CMOS sensor for $349.99. Both the SX530 and SX710, along with the $249.99 PowerShot SX610, feature support for Wi-Fi and NFC, which should make it easier to share images with your phone, computer, or wireless printer. Finally, Canon also unveiled two lower-end cameras with the PowerShot ELPH170 IS and PowerShot ELPH160, at $149.99 and $119.99 respectively.\nWhile the cameras vary quite a bit in terms of price and functionality, they all have at least one thing in common: they connect toÂ  Canon's new Connect Station , a just-announced media box for sharing and storing your photos. All five cameras are expected to launch in February.\n","Title":"Canon's new PowerShot cameras want to keep you connected | The Verge","Tags":["photography","tech","ces-2015"]}
