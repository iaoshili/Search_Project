The NYPL's $500,000 grant will offer 10,000 households a hotspot for a full year. That's as opposed to the 40 minutes of use people can get once a day through the library's 92 branches, and well beyond the pilot the library's done with 100 hotspots for the past month. The CPL program is more stringent, giving patrons a three week loan of the hardware.\nSeven other projects received major grant money as part of the Knight News Challenge. That list includes  Code2040's plan to offer professional technology programs to minority students, funding for secure mobile messaging app  TextSecure , and support for  open internet project Measurement Lab .\n","Title":"Libraries in Chicago and New York will soon let people check out Wi-Fi hotspots | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","tech"]}
