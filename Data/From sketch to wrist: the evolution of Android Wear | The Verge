Needless to say, it could've turned out very differently.\nHere are some of the most interesting visuals from the development process.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nAn early mockup shows how voice search could've looked.\nA variety of concepts for ways to represent events in time.\nGoogle experimented with horizontal movement between cards (like Google Glass) before deciding on a vertical orientation.\nOne possible Android Wear user interface, \"Accordion,\" was rejected as getting complicated too quickly.\nA \"Compass\" concept was tossed out for requiring too much movement to get between cards and actions.\nThe \"Zoom\" UI concept would've worked a bit like popular presentation app Prezi, but it just doesn't work on a tiny screen.\nMore mockups for Android Wear's voice search functionality.\nEarly mockups of Wear's home screen show that Google's designers were considering grids.\nInspiration for different screens and faces for round Android Wear devices.\nGoogle spent significant time experimenting with colors and legibility.\nGoogle's team looked at different color schemes for different display types, including grayscale and Mirasol .\nConcepts for showing multiple pieces of information in a shared small space.\nHow do you indicate that the watch is listening to you? Designers played with a bunch of concepts before settling on the red microphone.\nMockups of possible Android Wear themes.\nGoogle looked at high-design watches for inspiration.\n","Title":"From sketch to wrist: the evolution of Android Wear | The Verge","Tags":["google","exclusive","photo-essay","design","tech"]}
