{"Main text":"David Hasselhoff's new music video features dinosaurs, vikings, flamethrowers \u2014 and doesn't suck\n'True Survivor,' from the Kickstarted film Kung Fury\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI'm not a fan of ironic, nostalgic schlock, and the new David Hasselhoff music video looks like ironic, nostalgic schlock. So why do I dig it? Let's take a trip through my brain meat!\nMaybe what I'm feeling isn't joy, but profound empathy for a man I once watched drunkenly eat a cheeseburger off the floor.\nOr maybe this feeling is some chemically induced reaction, replicable whenever someone is shown dinosaurs, flamethrowers, and giant vikings within a certain window of time. Like mixing vinegar and baking soda, this is predictable eruption of happiness.\nOr maybe David Hasselhoff belting a powerful '80s action anthem takes me back to 1989, when the man stood atop the Berlin Wall and sang for freedom and peace \u2014 interrupting my afternoon cartoons.\nIt's probably the last one.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
