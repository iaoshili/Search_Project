{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDave Grohl will host, direct, and produce a new documentary series with HBO that will see the Foo Fighters frontman visit a number of legendary recording studios across the US. Grohl describes the project as \"a love letter to the history of American music,\" and it's essentially a continuation of the work he started in last year's Sound City documentary \u2014 which currently carries a  100 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes . Traveling between cities including Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, and Seattle, the rocker will set out to teach viewers about a studio's history and the artists who've spent time there. The goal is to showcase what makes each of them unique, and the host city usually has a lot to do with that.\nAnd of course you'll be hearing plenty of music. At every stop along his studio tour, Grohl recorded a new song with another famous, \"local legend\" musician. The guest list includes Kiss' Paul Stanley, Joe Walsh of The Eagles, and Heart's Nancy Wilson. The frontman says he held off in writing lyrics for each song so that he could absorb \"the experiences, interviews and personalities that became part of the process.\"\nUnfortunately the full list of studios hasn't yet been revealed, so you'll need to tune in this fall when the as-yet-untitled series debuts to see where Grohl goes. The premiere is set to coincide with the Foo Fighters' 20th anniversary, and the band is set to release its eighth studio album this fall.\n","Title":"Dave Grohl will tour famous recording studios in upcoming HBO series | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
