{"Main text":"Explore 75 years of Marvel superheroes from A-Bomb to Zzzax\nStudent web project maps the history of Marvel\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUltimate 75th is a slick exploration of Marvel Comics' prodigious stable of works. It's broken up into years, beginning with the company's inception in 1939. Clicking on a date will reveal even more data, notably the number of super heroes introduced or already existing during that time span, and the total series being produced or already created. From there, it's possible to then go through individual comic issues and peruse information like how many heroes made an appearance within its pages.\nThe website was developed in four days by an enterprising group of French students at HETIC, who used a combination of Marvel's own API and code from other sources to retrieve data about the company's storied history. According to an interview with The Verge, the team also implemented a cache system to allow for hundreds of thousands of requests as Marvel's API only permits 3,000 requests to be processed a day. Ultimate 75th definitely isn't perfect, but it's amazing to chart exactly how much Marvel has accomplished over the years. Unfortunately, the team behind the project will not be expanding it any further as they see it as a \"non-lucrative project.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
