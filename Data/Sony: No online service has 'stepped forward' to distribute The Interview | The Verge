{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA number of people \u2014 The Verge included \u2014 have  called on Sony to release The Interview online , be it streaming à la Netflix \/ Hulu or for sale on a service like iTunes \/ Google Play. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria (which will air in its entirety tonight), Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton says that while Sony \" has every desire \" to release the film, online isn't the immediate option. The network has been teasing the interview all day \u2014 here's the relevant snippet:\n\"There are a number of options open to us, and we have considered those and are considering those. As it stands right now, while there have been a number of suggestions... there has not been one major VOD distributor [or] one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said they're willing to distribute this movie for us... Again we don't have that direct interface with the American public.\"\nThis is a good time to remind our readers that Sony has its own online video platforms, including Crackle, home of  Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee .\nThough Lynton says no one has \"stepped forward,\" he doesn't say whether or not Sony has made any effort to reach out \u2014 at least not in the teaser clip that CNN has aired \u2014 nor did he touch base on DVD \/ Blu-ray plans. Earlier today Obama called it a \" mistake \" for Sony not to release the film.\nOne platform has, in fact, offered to distribute The Interview online: BitTorrent .\nUpdate: A new statement from Sony Pictures Entertainment says that the company has been \"actively surveying alternatives to enable us to release the movie on a different platform.\" Full statement below:\nSony Pictures Entertainment is and always has been strongly committed   to the First Amendment.  For more than three weeks, despite brutal   intrusions into our company and our employees\u2019 personal lives, we   maintained our focus on one goal:  getting the film The Interview   released. Free expression should never be suppressed by threats and   extortion.\nThe decision not to move forward with the December 25 theatrical   release of The Interview was made as a result of the majority of the   nation\u2019s theater owners choosing not to screen the film. This was   their decision.\nLet us be clear \u2013 the only decision that we have made with respect to   release of the film was not to release it on Christmas Day in   theaters, after the theater owners declined to show it. Without   theaters, we could not release it in the theaters on Christmas Day. We   had no choice.\nAfter that decision, we immediately began actively surveying   alternatives to enable us to release the movie on a different   platform.  It is still our hope that anyone who wants to see this   movie will get the opportunity to do so.\n","Title":"Sony: No online service has 'stepped forward' to distribute The Interview | The Verge","Tags":["culture","us-world","entertainment","national-security\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
