Whether or not they\u2019re common in real life, they take hold of our imagination so well that we barely question whether they belong in science fiction; they\u2019re sort of always already there, alongside more powerful computers and weirder fashion. Sometimes, we get it right. Often, we get it wrong, or at least right in a way that\u2019s majorly off-base, like the internet that so many people imagined as a virtual copy of the physical world.\nIt\u2019s tempting to feel embarrassed about this, to worry about looking like naifs, but it\u2019s usually more interesting that way. We\u2019d rather see something that feels right \u2014 that feels like some general idea of the future \u2014 than get an encyclopedia of our now-boring present. And no one is better at building places that are somehow familiar and strange at the same time than William Gibson.\nIn 2010, Gibson concluded the Blue Ant trilogy, a series of novels about the recent past that was so full of strange high-tech culture and secret knowledge that it was practically a new kind of science fiction. Now, for the first time in 15 years, he\u2019s back to speculate on the future with a novel set in a new world: The Peripheral. Actually, he\u2019s speculating on multiple futures \u2014 the novel alternates between two different time periods, one a generation or two past our own and the other much further ahead. In some ways, they\u2019re both places Gibson has been writing about for decades: a future backwater full of mass-produced goods and semi-legal hustling, and a hyper-networked high society whose every facet, from art to business to technology, seems unavoidably bound up in some vast conspiracy. In others, they\u2019re treading very new ground.\nThe plot is most enjoyable when you let yourself get swept away\nFlynne Fisher, the protagonist of the former world, is stuck supporting her mother in a dismal and vaguely Southern American town. She ekes out a living as, among other things, a professional gamer. Her brother has something akin to PTSD from serving in the Marines, and Flynne seems similarly affected by the steady grind of poverty, which her games exaggerate starkly: what looks to the rich like play is really a grueling way to survive. Sometimes, as Flynne finds out when she witnesses a gruesome murder in a virtual London, it might even be real... in a way.\nGenerations later \u2014 in a far future London, in fact \u2014 lives Wilf Netherton, The Peripheral\u2019s other protagonist. He\u2019s separated from Flynne by an extended disaster known as \"the jackpot,\" which kills most of the human race over a period of decades. His most immediate problems involve an outré performance artist poised to cause a diplomatic disaster in a micronation on the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. And its citizens\u2019 extreme body modifications are just the start of what technology can do. I don\u2019t want to spoil the pleasure of figuring out exactly how they connect, but the slowly-unfolding reveal is fascinating.\nFrom there, The Peripheral is a fast-paced murder investigation and political thriller \u2014 which, like many Gibson plots, is more enjoyable when you let yourself get swept away by the mass of ideas and set pieces than when you try to carefully fit every bit together. It\u2019s not exactly a time travel story, but it grapples with some of the problems that they often do, including the future\u2019s responsibility to the past. If you knew something terrible was going to happen, but you weren\u2019t sure why, how would you try to stop it? It also bears a marked resemblance to his 1988 novel Mona Lisa Overdrive, thrusting a streetwise young woman into a plan that alters the nature of reality itself.\nA 20-minutes-from-now blend of pop culture and extrapolated technology\nGibson, as he\u2019s said many times, isn\u2019t trying to be an oracle. Instead, he\u2019s uniquely good at recasting today\u2019s culture. That often involves a 20-minutes-from-now blend of pop culture, slightly extrapolated technology, and people who are supremely unimpressed by all of it. For anyone who read the Sprawl or Bridge trilogies after the \u201880s and \u201890s had passed, this is the first time we get to see him do it in, you could say, real time. Accordingly, people in Flynne\u2019s world drive Teslas, fly quadcopters, and understand how to properly 3D-print a cronut. London contains anachronistic \"cosplay zones\" in which historical accuracy is legally enforced. It\u2019s strange to watch your own fads fixed down like this, especially when you\u2019re not quite ready to let go of the idea that they\u2019re either new and exotic or stupid and ephemeral. The same goes for the jackpot, an environmental apocalypse that\u2019s become a common nightmare scenario in contemporary science fiction. It seems self-consciously dated, but in a way that\u2019s actually more interesting than a straightforward attempt at perfectly accurate prediction.\nYou keep imagining someone 20 years from now reading \"The Peripheral\"\nThe Peripheral is a book about how the future sees the past. It\u2019s not the first to make the connection between time travel and colonialism, or see our one-dimensional understanding of the past as something like orientalism. But it almost functions as a guidebook to the things the future will find dated about our conceptions of it. You keep imagining someone 20 years from now reading The Peripheral the way that we read Neuromancer today, perplexed at the now-unfathomable ubiquity of cassettes and modems. We laugh at the past or mine it for influence \u2014 think of steampunk, atompunk, dieselpunk, and the million other microgenres based on the incongruity of old societies and future tech \u2014 but someday, the future is going to do the same to us.\nFortunately, the worlds are compelling in their own right as well, despite their desolation. Flynne\u2019s town is dominated by big-box stores, the economy fueled by a combination of service jobs and 3D printing piracy. Netherton\u2019s London is a rehabilitated disaster area, where you\u2019re more likely to see telepresence robots outside than real people. But they\u2019re as full of personality as any crowded city, described in Gibson\u2019s pithy, poetic prose. The Peripheral also feels more accessible than his last several books. Pattern Recognition and its sequels slowly spiraled into a whirlpool of name-dropping \u2014 brands, art pieces, trends, all described in increasingly close detail. At best, the resulting aesthetic was fascinating, exposing the weirdness of our present. Sometimes, it was impenetrable. The same passion for minutiae is on display here, but it\u2019s toned down, integrated more into the characters\u2019 lives. The stakes are higher, and Flynne in particular is nuanced and relatable in a way that jet-setting artists and coolhunters often aren\u2019t.\nThough cyberpunk is often characterized as a cynical genre, Gibson has said that in the context of the Cold War and the \u201880s, it was hopeful to suggest that the world would survive at all. The Peripheral is undeniably bleak, but it takes this idea further \u2014 occasionally, to a point that feels like slightly forced optimism. Netherton\u2019s half of the book is a post-post-apocalyptic novel, set in a world where we\u2019ve weathered disasters but managed to finally overcome them. The scenarios that populate our nightmares are horrifying, but they aren\u2019t permanent. And Flynne\u2019s pre-apocalyptic wasteland might not be doomed. Even the future, it turns out, doesn\u2019t really know what the future holds.\n","Title":"William Gibson's 'The Peripheral': looking back at the future | The Verge","Tags":["culture","book-review","entertainment"]}
