{"Main text":"873 Comments\nWhether he\u2019s discussing NASA\u2019s impact on our cultural psyche or emailing James Cameron about the night sky, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson has a remarkably consistent message: our future depends on a passionate embrace of science, and for that to happen, science needs to be cool. It should come as no surprise then that Tyson serves as host of the new show Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, which debuts tonight as part of a major global event that will see the show simulcast across 10 domestic networks \u2014 with an introduction by President Obama , no less \u2014 before reaching more than 180 countries.\nA reboot of Carl Sagan\u2019s landmark 1980 program, the new Cosmos aims to be a primer on the incredible grandeur of the world around us, lionizing the scientists that have made our greatest discoveries, and hopefully stoking the fires for education and learning in the process. It\u2019s hard to find fault with such noble ambitions, and while the presence of a new Cosmos is certainly welcome the initial episode tries so hard to appeal to modern audiences that at times it feels like it\u2019s missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren\u2019t CG spectacle, but our own marvelous universe.\nPart Captain Kirk, part travelogue host\nOpening on the same cliff in Northern California where Sagan launched his own show 34 years ago, Cosmos begins with Tyson sounding the call that serves as the program\u2019s main theme. \"It\u2019s time to get going again,\" he says, before sweeping the viewer away on an exploration of our solar system. The vessel he uses throughout the show is dubbed the \"Spaceship of Imagination,\" a fictional craft that serves as a vantage point for Tyson and the show\u2019s writers to zip around the universe.\nThe same concept was used in the original, but Sagan\u2019s craft was primarily just seen from the inside. In the new version, the ship is realized as a shiny metal vehicle that zips to and fro, dodging asteroids and carrying out acrobatic flips. Inside, Tyson gazes intently out of its enormous viewing window \u2014 think the viewing screen on J.J. Abrams\u2019 Enterprise \u2014 or looks through portals on the ceiling and floor, which give glimpses into the future or the past.\nDesigned by concept artist Ryan Church (Star Trek Into Darkness), the ship is certainly a flashy piece of effects work, but it ends up spending far too much time as the focal point of the show. Lingering closeups, with the far reaches of space reflected in its impossibly mirrored exterior, put the focus on fantasy \u2014 not the glory and wonder of the universe.\nTonally the show strikes just the right balance between education and inspiration. The science explored in the opening episode isn\u2019t anything teenaged astronomy fans wouldn\u2019t already be aware of, but the show doesn\u2019t talk down to the viewer. That said, those already familiar with the antics of Dr. Tyson may feel like they\u2019re getting a watered-down version of the real thing. In Cosmos he\u2019s part Captain Kirk, part travelogue host, but he\u2019s missing the charismatic urgency he\u2019s become known for. The passion he displayed during a SXSW Q&A was infinitely more engaging than his performance in the show, even when he\u2019s recounting his own inspirational childhood encounter with Sagan.\nThankfully Cosmos finds its footing in the final stretch, when Tyson visualizes the lifetime of our entire universe through the scale of a human calendar year. The Big Bang starts on January 1st \u2014 complete with an epic blast that threatens to envelop the host \u2014 whereas the breadth of human history encompasses just the final moments of December 31st. It\u2019s the show at its very best: visually conveying an abstract concept, weaved into the context of humanity\u2019s place in the universe.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine an educational show about science being any sort of major network hit in 2014 \u2014 no doubt part of the reason why Cosmos features so many visual effects \u2014 but Fox is leveraging multiple arms of its media empire to make it work. Even after the splashy debut the entire season will air both on the Fox network and on National Geographic, and as cable has proven shows don\u2019t need to have a Friends-sized audience to work their way into the zeitgeist. One episode in, Cosmos certainly isn\u2019t perfect, but the fact is that right now there\u2019s nothing else like it on television. At SXSW Dr. Tyson said the goal of the show was simply to start a conversation \u2014 and by that measure, it\u2019s certainly off to a good start.\n","Title":"'Cosmos' review: making science cool again | The Verge","Tags":["culture","review","science","entertainment","sxsw-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5246005"]}
