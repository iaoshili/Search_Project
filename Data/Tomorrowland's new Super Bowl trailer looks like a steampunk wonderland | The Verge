{"Main text":"Tomorrowland's new Super Bowl trailer looks like a steampunk wonderland\nOut May 22, 2015\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith the exception of a  teaser trailer released last year , insight into Disney's upcoming fantasy flick Tomorrowland has remained largely under wraps. This week, Disney promised Tomorrowland's Super Bowl ad would  unravel a little more of the mystery , and tonight it has delivered...sort of.\nThe clip shows George Clooney, Britt Robertson, and Hugh Laurie entering a world with flying trains, massive skyscrapers, a litany of steampunk-looking machines, and some very suspenseful music. The story goes, Tomorrowland was inspired by a box found in the Disney archives that contained mysterious clues to a world unknown.\nThe movie, a collaboration between Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and Damon Lindelof (Lost, Star Trek Into Darkness), is out in May.\nDisney and Google have also partnered to create  Take Me To Tomorrowland , a site they're calling a \"multi-sensorial experience,\"  which lets users explore the movie's environment from different angles. The site promises a 360-degree look at Tomorrowland when it launches fully this spring.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
