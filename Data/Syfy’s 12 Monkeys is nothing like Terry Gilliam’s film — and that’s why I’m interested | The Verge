I think it was A Nightmare on Elm Street that did it, oddly enough; leave it to a series full of mostly forgettable sequels to push me over the edge, but that was it. It didn\u2019t matter that past remakes like John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing had become classics in their own right, or that Christopher Nolan\u2019s Batman Begins was a more balanced, mature film than Tim Burton had ever tried to make. I had reached peak remake saturation.\nAnd then they started coming to television.\nAt first it seemed more like a cute prequel parlor trick than a trend. Bryan Fuller\u2019s excellent Hannibal took on pre-Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter to wonderful effect, and Bates Motel latched onto the adolescent years of Psycho\u2019s Norman Bates for its own charming, if uneven, mash-up of Oedipal issues and Twin Peaks small-town weirdisms. But the remake deals kept closing, and now Hollywood is awash in projects repurposing old movie properties for the small screen.\nThis Friday, Syfy debuts its latest foray into the arena with 12 Monkeys, a new series based on Terry Gilliam\u2019s 1995 cult classic . The building blocks are familiar: 30 years in the future a mysterious virus has wiped out humanity, and a group of scientists send a man named James Cole back to our present to investigate the disease\u2019s origins. Aaron Stanford (The CW\u2019s Nikita) swaps in for Bruce Willis, while Amanda Schull is Cassandra, a doctor that teams up with him to try to save humanity.\nThe original 12 Monkeys, like the French short La Jet√©e that inspired it, was a puzzle box movie about insanity and inevitability, carefully crafted to wrap around itself and land an unexpected emotional punch at the end. How a series would tackle that element was one of the things I was most interested in, but the answer appears to be that Syfy is sidestepping it completely and doing something different with the premise. And as strange as it sounds, that\u2019s one of the most interesting things about the series.\nThe new 12 Monkeys is a straightforward sci-fi adventure, with Cole time-tripping from year to year \u2014 the show calls it \u201Csplintering,\u201D presumably because that\u2019s supposed to sound cool \u2014 thanks to a chemical process that also conveniently gives him accelerated healing powers and enhanced fighting ability. In that sense it\u2019s nothing at all like Gilliam\u2019s film, and the straightforward treatment carries on throughout. The wide-lens dystopia of the original is gone, replaced by a polished but much less distinguished aesthetic \u2014 call it basic cable futurism \u2014 and the jagged edginess of Willis\u2019 Cole is pounded flat. Instead, Stanford creates a generic action hero with no real sense of personality or past (at least, nothing we see in the first two episodes). It gets 12 Monkeys into trouble; without strong lead performances to ground the universe, the show\u2019s strained reaches left me laughing for all the wrong reasons. (Genius doctor after going over Cole\u2019s vitals: \u201CThis guy is a flesh and blood molecular computer!\u201D)\nBut it can take time for a series to find its footing, and co-creators Travis Fickett and Terry Matalas are clearly interested in using the broader canvas to play with the conventions of time travel and to grow the film\u2019s nugget of a premise into an expanded universe\u2019s worth of mythology. When Cole starts ricocheting off people that have already met his future self, Doctor Who-style, 12 Monkeys is at its best.\nThat\u2019s particularly clear once the show gets all the introductory necessities of the pilot out of the way and shifts its focus to the daughter of a rich biotech executive (Emily Hampshire, in the role originally played by Brad Pitt) and a mysterious villain that is part Stephen King creation and part Slenderman . 12 Monkeys\u2019 allure is not in the familiar premise, but in the promise of things beyond the edges of Gilliam\u2019s vision \u2014 and a reminder that while film reboots may have limited tools to work with, serialized television is another matter entirely.\nWhen tackling a known character or story in two hours, there\u2019s an inherent tension between satisfying expectations while also differentiating from the source material. It\u2019s why rebooted origin stories are so exhausting; how many different ways can we really see Peter Parker become Spider-Man? TV, on the other hand, is all about long-term world building. Characters, relationships, narrative set-ups and pay-offs evolve and play out over years. Quite simply, television does things movies can\u2019t, and with the right creative forces at the helm, a show can use an existing premise to tell an entirely new set of stories \u2014 just ask Fargo\u2019s Noah Hawley.\nTelevision is able to do things that movies simply can't\nNot to compare the two shows directly, of course. Monkeys isn\u2019t even attempting the kind of storytelling that Hawley was able to pull off, but it already has enough secrets and mysteries set into motion that I\u2019ve set my DVR to find out what happens next. And while my stance on movie reboots may not have softened, I\u2019m somehow optimistic about the potential of these television projects. You only need to travel back 11 years to find evidence that Syfy \u2014 then just SciFi \u2014 knew how to rework a property with Ronald D. Moore\u2019s Battlestar Galactica (another show, it should be noted, that struggled with some clumsy performances and B-movie flavor before hitting stride).\nIn any case, we might as well all make our peace with the movie-to-TV reboot concept now. With Minority Report , Real Genius, and Evil Dead just some of the titles currently in the works, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to have much of a choice.\n","Title":"Syfy\u2019s 12 Monkeys is nothing like Terry Gilliam\u2019s film \u2014 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m interested | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv-reviews"]}
