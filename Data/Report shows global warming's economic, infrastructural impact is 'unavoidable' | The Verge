The third of its kind, the report was instituted by the Global Change Research Act of 1990. However, this effort contrasts with previous ones in that scientists are now much more confident in their research and their subsequent call for action. As the report reads, \"Continued warming and an increased understanding of the U.S. temperature record, as well as multiple other sources of evidence, have strengthened our confidence in the conclusions that the warming trend is clear and primarily the result of human activities.\"\nThe conclusions themselves are dire. The northeastern United States alone, for instance, has received more heavy precipitation in the last half century than any other region in the US, and the sea level is approximately eight inches higher there than the global average. Heat waves, flooding, and accelerated sea level changes pose threats to people, agriculture, fishing, and infrastructures in major eastern cities, prompting 11 of the 12 northeastern states to develop adaptive strategies to curb the damage.\n\"The findings... underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change.\"\nIn response to the findings of the assessment, the Obama White House issued a statement calling for immediate action to combat climate change. \"The findings in this National Climate Assessment underscore the need for urgent action to combat the threats from climate change, protect American citizens and communities today, and build a sustainable future for our kids and grandkids.\" The response comes during a week focused on climate initiatives, which will see the president holding a summit on green building tactics and,  according to CNN , will announce new solar energy plans. The plans come as part of Obama's second-term focus on climate, which saw him recently  issue an executive order calling for local governments and agencies to better adapt global warming.\n","Title":"Report shows global warming's economic, infrastructural impact is 'unavoidable' | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world"]}
