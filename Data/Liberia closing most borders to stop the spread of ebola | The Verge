{"Main text":"Liberia closing most borders to stop the spread of ebola\nOutbreak has killed over 670 to date\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLiberia is closing down most of its borders and quarantining certain communities as it attempts to crack down on the spread of ebola within the region, which has so far killed over 670, including 129 people in Liberia alone,  reports the Associated Press . The country's president outlined on Sunday the new measures being put into place to restrict spread of the disease, which does not have a known cure. In addition to closing all but three of its border crossings and quarantining communities widely affected by the virus, the restrictions include limitations on public demonstrations and requirements that certain venues, such as restaurants, run a five-minute video on ebola.\nThe current ebola outbreak  became the largest ever recorded over a month ago, and it's still spreading. Guinea and Sierra Leone have also had residents infected with the virus, which is believed  to have begun spreading from Guinea at the beginning of the year . Despite the tight restrictions, Liberia will reportedly be keeping open its international airport. Liberia will instead set up ebola testing stations at all open airports and border crossings, but specific requirements about use of those tests haven't yet been announced.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
