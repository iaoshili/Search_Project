Check\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBilled widely as Ethiopia\u2019s first post-apocalyptic sci-fi film, Crumbs, (directed by Spanish-born, Addis Ababa-based director Miguel Llans√≥) is the story of Birdy and Candy, survivors of a vaguely referenced \"Big War\" that leaves the world's population in tatters. From the looks of it, Birdy and Candy lead a sad, strange, and terrifying life: they live in a decrepit bowling alley, a rusted spaceship hangs immobile in the sky above, and Birdy has to face off with what appears to be a Power Ranger on horseback. Oh yeah, and Santa Claus makes an appearance. The Hollywood Reporter, which reviewed Crumbs at the Rotterdam Film Festival, gave it a tentative thumbs up, calling it \"outlandish and imaginative.\" IndiePix just picked up the film for distribution in the US and frankly, I couldn't be more excited.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
