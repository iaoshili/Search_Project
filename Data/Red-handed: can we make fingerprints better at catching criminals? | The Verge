In many respects, they still are: most lawyers and judges still consider fingerprints the easiest form of forensic evidence for juries to understand, and they still appear in more criminal court cases than most other types of forensic evidence. But the strength of this fingerprint evidence, and its standing in the forensic community, is far less cut and dry. And despite its use in criminal cases since the late 19th century, scientists have only just begun to examine how unique our fingerprints truly are \u2014 and how good forensic examiners are at telling them apart.\n\"Up until 2011, there was no scientific data on the accuracy of fingerprint matches,\" says Simon Cole, a criminology professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of  a book on the history of fingerprint identification. \"That year, we had the first two major studies and they showed that it's highly accurate in the test conditions.\"\nTwo people were falsely implicated in criminal cases in Los Angeles in 2008\nBy highly accurate, Cole means that about one in 1,000 fingerprint examinations inaccurately matches a print with a previous offender. Conversely, about 7.5 percent of examinations falsely clear someone as a potential match. This is near perfect, Cole says, and it indicates that forensic examiners tend to be conservative when matching the fingerprints found in crime scenes with those in databases. But those results were obtained under laboratory test conditions, so figuring out \"to what extent those general rates would match those we see in real life,\" Cole says, is \"a tricky question.\" And unfortunately, real-life errors do occur: in  Los Angeles , for example, forensic examiners falsely implicated two people in criminal cases in 2008.\nThat's why members of the forensic community are seeking to alter the future of fingerprinting by changing the way the evidence is obtained and evaluated \u2014 not to mention how it's reported in the courtroom.\nImproving the technology\nCurrently, fingerprints are obtained from surfaces like cardboard, leather and glass, using tools such as powders, gels, and lifting tape. They're mainly used to place a person at the scene of a crime. But Simona Francese, a forensic scientist at Sheffield Hallam University, thinks that forensic examiners can get a lot more information out of a fingerprint. \"I am working on the development of a technology that enables researchers to detect molecules in fingerprints,\" Francese says.\nGetting more information out of a fingerprint\nIn so doing, she hopes investigators will be able to tell if the fingerprint's owner smokes cigarettes or takes drugs. The technique, she says, can even determine if a person is a genetic male or a genetic female, because each sex produces a unique combinations of peptides \u2014 short chains of amino acids \u2014 in their sweat. By using a statistical model, Francese says that \"researchers can predict the sex of the person with  85 percent accuracy .\" She even thinks they might be able to predict a person's ethnicity using the same method in the near future.\n\"Researchers can predict the sex of the person with  85 percent accuracy .\"\nThe technique that Francese and her colleagues have developed \u2014 which is already used by  police officers in West Yorkshire , UK \u2014 doesn't just add more information to a suspect's profile. It also improves the reading of the print itself, because it can be used to reconstruct multiple images of a fingermark. \"You can map the location of various kinds of molecules located on those ridges,\" she says, and tease them apart to create a number of fingerprint reconstructions that increase the accuracy of an examiner's reading.\nBut the method won't soon be ready for court, Francese says. Instead, it will largely be used to provide investigators with supplementary information they can use to create a suspect profile. And researchers still want to do more studies to find out if there are limitations to fingerprint sex determination. \"We will need to study people with diseases or people that take medications,\" Francese notes, to \"see if the profile survives beyond these disturbing elements.\"\nOther projects are focusing on how investigators develop fingermarks in the field, because obtaining a fingerprint from a given surface is still considered impossible in many situations. One team of researchers in Israel, for instance, is currently trying to develop fingerprints on rocks \u2014  surfaces that investigators usually don't sample because of a low success rate. Another project is even more ambitious, as researchers in Spain are trying to develop prints that were  formed underwater .\nUnderwater crime-solving\n\"Some of the elements that make fingermarks \u2014 those that are soluble \u2014 are lost when they come in contact with water,\" says Ana Castello, a forensic science researcher at The University of Valencia who worked on the project. \"There are several publications on the treatment of fingerprints on surfaces that have been wet after depositing the fingermarks, but not when these fingermarks were generated underwater.\" Her technique, she says, makes use of various powders, including what's known as small particle reagent \u2014 a powder that investigators already use to lift prints off slightly wet surfaces. To develop a fingerprint that was formed in water, the object in question needs to be dried out properly, and the surface can only be made out of glass or plastic.\nStill, Castello thinks there's a future for underwater fingerprints in forensics \u2014 and a future for technological improvements in forensics as a whole.  \"We need to know more and better methods that can help us get as close as possible to the truth,\" Castello says. This quest, she says \"represents nothing more and nothing less than helping bring criminals to justice.\"\nChanging attitudes, assessing odds\nBut bringing the right people to justice can only be achieved if examiners properly report the reliability of their findings. \"In the past, fingerprint testimony has been badly overstated in court, but now we are working in the right direction,\" says Edward Imwinkelried, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who has  written about the need for fingerprint matching technique reform.\nImwinkelried credits two reports released by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology in 2009 and  2012 \u2014 both of which outline steps for examiners to improve fingerprint matching \u2014 for the change in attitude he's witnessed in the forensic community. \"Some now say things like \u2018you should regard my testimony as an opinion and not scientific fact.'\" This is a big improvement, Imwinkelried explains, because examiners used to testify that they could match a print to a specific person, \"to the exclusion of everyone else.\"\nBut David Kaye, a law professor at Penn State, says the change isn't universal. \"How many people are following those recommendations, I don't know,\" he says. \"And does it make any difference to remove a sentence that says \u2018to the exclusion of everyone else?' \u2014 it seems more like a cosmetic change, really.\"\nQuantifying the reliability of fingerprints so jurors can understand\nKaye represents a part of the legal community that thinks juries still have trouble evaluating forensic expert testimony. Views like these are why Sargur Srihari, a computer scientist at the University at Buffalo who has served on a national committee that sought to improve forensics in the US, has developed a  way of quantifying the reliability of fingerprint evidence that's easier for juries to understand. \"We all live our lives with odds,\" Srihari says. \"People understand them.\" If a juror knows what the odds are that a print matches that of a given suspect, he says, they'll be able to gage the weight that each testimony deserves in their final decision.\n\"When an examiner looks at a print, they have to take into account not only the similarity of the two fingerprints, but also the rarity of those similarities,\" Srihari says. So he used population frequency data to determine how often one might encounter a set of fingerprint features, and how independent these features are from each other. Armed with this math, Srihari says, jurors will have the tools they need to make sense of the science.\nUnfortunately, this approach assumes that jurors can understand what odds like 5 in 1000 or 50 to 1 actually mean \u2014 and some studies have already shown that jurors can have trouble  understanding probabilities in courtroom settings. Moreover, some fingerprint examiners are reticent to include probabilities in their work. \"The fingerprint community has been quite conservative about embracing statistical models,\" Kaye says. \"And there are examiners who worry that they will be replaced [by computers].\"\n\"That experience can be flawed.\"\nBut forensic examiners will undoubtedly be forced to embrace new technologies as they become more accessible \u2014 and more accurate than examiners themselves. \"Fingerprint, handwriting, and tire tread evidence all involve experts who come in and testify based on their experience,\" Srihari says. On that basis alone, an examiner can testify that a fingerprint on the crime scene belongs to a certain suspect. \"But that experience can be flawed,\" he says, \"and you can have the same flawed experience for over 20 years.\"\n\"Well-trained analysts have been known to make mistakes,\" Kaye adds, \"but fingerprint evidence is generally good.\" The hard part, he says, \"is figuring out when it's not, and presenting it for what its worth \u2014 and no more than that.\"\n","Title":"Red-handed: can we make fingerprints better at catching criminals? | The Verge","Tags":["report","science"]}
