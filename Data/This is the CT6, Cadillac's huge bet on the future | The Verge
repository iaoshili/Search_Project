{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere's Cadillac's next huge car, both literally and figuratively: the CT6, which stands for Cadillac Touring 6.\nGM's luxury brand has been teasing the CT6 for quite some time, and for good reason: it's a flagship sedan, a segment that the company has been absent from since it discontinued the forgettable DTS several years ago.\nIt's no coincidence that crosstown rival Lincoln debuted the giant Continental concept at this very same show \u2014 Cadillac and Lincoln are both learning that luxury marques look a little lost without a big flagship in the lineup, and the red-hot Chinese market is demanding large American sedans anyway. The time is right, if you believe GM and Ford.\nThe CT6 will be offered with an exclusive 3-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine (like the Continental) that puts out 400 horsepower and 400 ft-lb. of torque, impressive numbers considering the displacement. There's also an enhanced version of Cue \u2014 Cadillac's infortainment system \u2014 that now includes a touchpad in the center console and the promise of faster response times. (The first-generation Cue hardware is notoriously laggy.)\nWhat this all means is that the era of V-8s in big, American flagship luxury sedans is over \u2014 efficiency reigns supreme, and engineers are squeezing absurd amounts of reliable power out of smaller engines. It's a little surprising that they're not showing a plug-in hybrid variant here \u2014 much less a full electric \u2014 but that can't be too far off.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"This is the CT6, Cadillac's huge bet on the future | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","transportation"]}
