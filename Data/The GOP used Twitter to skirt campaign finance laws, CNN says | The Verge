{"Main text":"US & World\nThe GOP used Twitter to skirt campaign finance laws, CNN says\nTweets posted costly internal polling data, and may have crossed the line on rules about \"coordinated\" campaign spending\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBoth Democrats and Republicans take millions of dollars from outside groups to run campaigns, but under law, the parties can't \"coordinate\" with those groups, only accept the cash. As  CNN reports today , the GOP may have found a way to quietly keep in touch: Twitter.\nThe accounts posted internal polling data\nReporter Chris Moody uncovered Twitter accounts that, at first blush, seem like gibberish \u2014 sequences like \"CA-40\/43-44\/49-44\/44-50\/36-44\/49-10\/16\/14-52-->49\/476-10s.\" But the numbers, posted on multiple public accounts, showed internal polling data for House races ahead of this month's election. Using that information, the GOP could better know where to focus time and resources for maximum effect.\nAccording to a CNN source, at least two spending groups \u2014  American Crossroads and American Action Network \u2014 as well as the House GOP campaign arm \u2014 the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 knew about the accounts. The accounts were deleted minutes after CNN contacted the NRCC about them.\nThe definition of \"coordinated\" in campaign spending sits on murky legal territory. In this case, since the tweets were posted publicly, albeit quietly, it's unclear whether any rules were violated. The GOP accused Democrats of skirting campaign laws when tweets posted by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's accounts later showed up in ads funded by outside groups.\nIt does seem like the people behind the Twitter accounts had a sense of humor. As CNN explains, one of the now-deleted accounts was named after the fictional West Wing character Bruno Gianelli, who attempted to fund campaigns with possibly unethical cash.\n","Title":"The GOP used Twitter to skirt campaign finance laws, CNN says | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","tech"]}
