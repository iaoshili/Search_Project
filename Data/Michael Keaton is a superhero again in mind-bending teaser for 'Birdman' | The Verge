{"Main text":"Michael Keaton is a superhero again in mind-bending teaser for 'Birdman'\nKeaton plays an actor playing an iconic superhero in self-referential new film from '21 Grams' director.\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBefore Christian Bale came along,  Batman was synonymous with one actor:  Michael Keaton . Now the man who brought the caped crusader to life in the darkly cartoonish 1989 Tim Burton movie is returning over 25 years later as a similarly angsty superhero with wings: Birdman . Or, to be accurate, Keaton plays the part of an actor famous for playing a superhero called Birdman trying to mount a late-career comeback in a Broadway play. If that sounds confusing, that's because it's meant to be.\nThe new black comedy from acclaimed Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu (Babel, 21 Grams) is a self-referential look at the business of Hollywood and what it does to movie stars and those close to them. But as is clear from this first trailer for Birdman, the film will also involve surreal scenes of asteroids, beached seals, nightmarish giant birds, and a shirtless Keaton leading paparazzi through Times Square. It's also got Emma Stone and Edward Norton. If that sounds like your thing (and why wouldn't it?) prepare to heed the call this fall: the film hits theaters October 17th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
