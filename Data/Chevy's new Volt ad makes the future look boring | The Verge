{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe  second-generation Chevrolet Volt that's coming out later this year is probably the most technologically advanced production car that General Motors has ever announced. You wouldn't know that from the ad it  posted to YouTube this week, though \u2014 a one-minute, 11-second sequence of sensible motoring through urban and suburban landscapes interjected by finger swipes that are supposed to make it look like an iPad or something, I guess? All the while, inoffensive jams waft from your speakers. There's no narration or graphic overlay, because you wouldn't actually want to know anything about the car.\nHow do you sell a vanilla car with mint chocolate chip technology?\nThe ad is indicative of a larger problem for Chevrolet: the Volt has to look and act like a normal, mass-market vehicle with vanilla styling and performance to match. Ergo, you end up with a vanilla ad like this one. But the car's high-tech underpinnings \u2014 the extended-range electric drivetrain that promises 50 miles on battery power alone \u2014 drive up the cost. So you have something that looks like a bit like a Honda Civic for many thousands of dollars more, paired with an ad that makes no attempt to explain the difference.\nGM has plenty of time between now and the Volt's on-sale date to explain why everyday drivers should shell out for one of these, but this sleep aid ( like Samsung's for the Gear VR ) isn't the campaign to do it.\nVerge Video: Up Close with the All New Chevy Bolt\n","Title":"Chevy's new Volt ad makes the future look boring | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
