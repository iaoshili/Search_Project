{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith the  first Star Wars: The Force Awakens teaser out of the way and talked about ad infinitum, the next big question is: what's next? Well, looks like we'll be waiting at most half a year: SlashFilm reports (and sound logic dictates) that the next Star Wars trailer will play before Disney's very large superhero blockbuster sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's scheduled for release May 1st, 2015, which also happens to be the weekend before May 4th \u2014 aka  Star Wars Day . (\"May the Fourth \/ Force Be With You.\" Get it?)\nThat all seems obvious enough, but what about the 165 or so days before Marvel's next film? There are two big Disney films in between (Into the Woods on Christmas Day and Cinderella on March 13th), but those don't necessarily seem as obvious of a tie-in as, say, the Super Bowl. Plus Abrams and company have been (mostly) good about keeping the excitement going online through various teasers. We probably won't get any major reveals, however \u2014  by our count , there are about six newcomers and all the returning players whose faces we've yet see \u2014 until some tentpole event.\nLook on the light side: you've only got, like, five or six months to go. At most.\n","Title":"A new Star Wars trailer is coming with Avengers: Age of Ultron | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
