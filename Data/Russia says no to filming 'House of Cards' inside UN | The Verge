Diplomat Mikael Agasandyan explained the reasons over email, stating that the premises should be kept available for use by members and were not appropriate as a stage for the political drama series. China was similarly hesitant, wanting a \"rough idea on the scripts\" before making a concrete decision.\nForeign Policy reports that the UN Department of Public Information had advocated cooperation, as it believed that the production could help raise awareness about the organization. The show's producers reportedly wanted to film a scene depicting a meeting in the Security Council and a discussion between ambassadors. Shooting was planned for mid-August, and would have taken place during weekends or late at night. An anonymous council member also noted that discussions may still be underway, meaning that Russia's decision might eventually be rescinded.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
