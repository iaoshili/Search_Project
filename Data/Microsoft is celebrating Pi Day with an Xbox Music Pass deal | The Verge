{"Main text":"Microsoft is celebrating Pi Day with an Xbox Music Pass deal\nA 12-month pass is only $31.41 \u2014 get it?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday, March 14th, is Pi Day. While some will celebrate by eating lots of pie, or  waking up at exactly 9:26:53 AM , Microsoft is paying homage to the mathematical constant with a deal that doubles as a play on the pi digits. But for 24 hours, you'll also be able to buy a 12-month pass to Xbox Music for just $31.41.\nA year-long pass for the service usually costs $99, which means the Pi Day price will save you almost $70. The offer is good for new subscriptions and renewals of existing subscriptions.\nMicrosoft  started charging for the music streaming service at the end of last year, so if you gave up once the free ride was over, now might be a good time to reconsider.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
