This is the exact same evolution that Netflix has been going through, building out its own CDN and agreeing to pay ISPs for interconnection. The major difference is that Netflix has loudly opposed the fact that ISPs can charge a fee for this arrangement, while Apple has stayed mum on the...\nApple is not short on cash\nUpdate\nNetflix is now also paying AT&T to improve streaming quality\nBy Chris Welch on July  29, 2014 05:57 pm\nNetflix has signed another interconnection deal with another ISP: AT&T. The two sides have reached an agreement that should over time result in better streaming performance for Netflix subscribers. Terms of the deal aren't being disclosed, so we don't know how much Netflix paid for direct access to AT&T's network. But it's likely modeled after similar deals Netflix reached with Comcast and Verizon earlier in the year.  Mashable first reported the new agreement between Netflix and AT&T.\nU...\nAdd another to the list\nUpdate\n20 9 months ago 160\nVerizon says Level 3 is looking to get a 'free ride' for its massive Netflix traffic\nBy Ben Popper on July  21, 2014 11:35 am\nThere's a new volley in the war of words over the internet congestion that is hurting the performance of Netflix streaming video:  Verizon published a blog post this morning pointing out that, back in 2005, Level 3 got into a dispute with fellow internet provider Cogent over an imbalance in the way they shared traffic. Level 3's position was that Cogent needed to find a way to balance that traffic or pay for the difference. Verizon argues that this is exactly the same dispute now playing out...\ntrying to get a free ride on someone else's network.\nUpdate\nHow one man bypassed internet congestion and fixed his Netflix streaming\nBy Ben Popper on July  18, 2014 03:31 pm\nColin Nederkoorn, a startup CEO living in New York City, was unhappy with his Netflix service. He pays Verizon for FiOS service that promises 75Mbps down. But when he tried to stream video, it was a miserable experience, with buffering and low-definition pictures. So Nederkoorn decided to measure the speed of his connection. What he found was that when he was streaming Netflix he was getting speeds of just 375kbps, or 0.5 percent of what he was paying Verizon for.\nOne man cuts through the crap\nUpdate\nDid Verizon accidentally admit it's slowing down Netflix traffic? Level 3 thinks so\nBy Ben Popper on July  17, 2014 04:27 pm\nThere has been a back-and-forth battle in recent weeks about what is  causing the internet congestion that is degrading service to Netflix consumers. Last week Verizon published a blog post that offered the first real specifics in the debate, saying that it had studied the situation closely based on a customer in Los Angeles and found that there was plenty of capacity available at different points where Netflix could deliver traffic to its network.

Netflix had previously sent its customers messages blaming congestion on Verizon's network,  messages it withdrew after a Verizon filed a cease and desist. And while many consumers have been siding with Netflix in blaming the big ISPs, the truth is that Netflix...\nNetflix wants a free ride\nUpdate\nFCC scrutinizing Netflix speed issues on Comcast and Verizon\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on June  13, 2014 01:18 pm\nAfter months of complaints by Netflix, the Federal Communications Commission  is beginning to look into the streaming quality issues that Netflix subscribers have been seeing on Comcast and Verizon. Netflix has been in  a heated and public battle with internet providers over network congestion that's supposedly slowing its service down, with both sides pinning responsibility on the other. \"Consumers pay their ISP and they pay content providers like Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon.

In a blog post accompanying its monthly speed reports, released today, Netflix says that it will be ending the \"small-scale test\" of these messages, one of which gained wide attention last week for claiming that Verizon's network was congested. Verizon issued a cease and desist against the messages on Thursday, claiming that Netflix...\nNetflix does not purposely select congested routes.\nUpdate\nVerizon sends Netflix cease and desist over streaming quality warnings\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on June   5, 2014 02:53 pm\nVerizon has sent Netflix a cease and desist order demanding that it stop presenting its subscribers  with messages that blame Verizon's network for poor streaming performance.

In May,  Netflix began testing an error message telling users that congestion with their ISP was hurting their service quality. \"The Verizon network is crowded right now,\" said one message shown during buffering. But \"this claim is not only inaccurate, it is deliberately misleading,\" says Verizon, suggesting that the choice was a political move meant to score points in the net...\nIt is sad that Netflix is willing to deliberately mislead its customers so they can be used as pawns.\nUpdate\nNetflix tests warnings that blame internet providers for poor streaming quality\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes on June   4, 2014 09:23 am\nNetflix wants you to know whose fault it is that your movie isn't loading \u2014 and, big surprise, it's pinning the issue on internet service providers.

This positions Google squarely behind Reed Hastings, who has argued that such interconnect fees are an  unfair toll being charged by internet gatekeepers and that the FCC should ban them as part of an expanded definition of net neutrality.

It argued that Comcast could use its newfound power to charge a toll for content that might compete with its own video offerings \u2014 a toll like the one that Netflix  already found itself paying to improve the quality of streaming for Comcast customers.
