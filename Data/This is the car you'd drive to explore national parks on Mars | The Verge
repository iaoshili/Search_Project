{"Main text":"This is the car you'd drive to explore national parks on Mars\nThe dream of the VW Microbus lives on in this concept car\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBrazilian designer Eduardo Galvani has put together renderings for a concept car he's dubbed the \"Nimbus.\" It's a bulbous, van-like hybrid that evokes the nostalgia we feel for the classic VW Microbus, but lives in a future world where car design is free to be whimsical \u2014 if not a little weird.\nGalvani also imagined the features and the details of how the van would operate: a rear engine paired with an electric motor, big knobby semi-cross tires, a tablet-based center panel display, and of course a mini-fridge with room for eight cans of your beverage of choice. Though Galvani says it would weigh about 3,570 pounds, what it really weighs is nothing; it's as solid as the CAD rendering file it was made with, as hefty as our dreams of touring a national park on Mars while ensconced in a glass-and-metal orb.\nYou can see more of the Nimbus below, or visit Galvani's site for a full gallery .\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe Nimbus is a bubble-shaped combination of curved glass, carbon-fiber, titanium, aluminum, and whimsy.\nA ladder and roof rack help evoke the classic VW Microbus.\nGalvani imagines the Nimbus would offer four drive modes, including 4WD. It would also have sensors for obstacle detection.\nThe 130Kw (180hp) electrical engine would be mounted in the back and also powered by a gasoline engine.\nAlongside the roof storage, the Nimbus would have solar panels to help power itself.\nThe central feature of the dashboard would be a multi-function, removable tablet.\nThe Nimbus seats only five people, however, to better make room for the built-in refrigerator.\nThe Nimbus has a proposed range of 200 miles and a max speed of 100 mph.\nGalvani says the Nimbus would have a \"safe virtual position,\" with drivers and passengers situated high above the ground.\nThe Nimbus could be the perfect vehicle for observing the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
