{"Main text":"Bud Light's Super Bowl ad puts a man in the middle of a life-size Pac-Man game\nIf only drinking beer could actually make this happen\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor many people, the big-budget,  celebrity-exploiting commercials are the best part of the Super Bowl, and Bud Light is responsible for some of the  most popular ones . It doesn't look like that's going to change in 2015. This year, Bud Light is appealing to America's fondness for nostalgia and super-sized things with a life-size Pac-Man game.\nDreams do come true\nIn the commercial, one lucky dudebro, after accepting a crisp Bud Light, gets to enter the maze. He's shoved into a dubstep-soundtracked stadium, and a woman with a microphone says, \"You. Are. Pac-Man.\" He darts through the maze \u2014 sweaty, exhilarated, kind of drunk. The floor is lined with glowing pac-dots, and around every corner are big, waddling ghosts, waiting to cause trouble.\nThe commercial's \"Up For Whatever\" tagline  continues from last year , when Bud Light's Super Bowl commercial planted a guy in a pseudo-reality hidden camera show. Beer in hand, he popped champagne in a limo with comedian Reggie Watts and met Don Cheadle in an elevator \u2014 pretty much on the same plane of adventure as playing a giant Pac-Man game.\nAt the end of the day, this is still a video hawking a low-calorie beer, but sometimes consumerism (especially during one of the  most-watched sports events ever ) still gives us nice things to look at. Oh, and you won't believe what the man wins once the game is over. Hint: it's Bud Light.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story stated that Budweiser, not Bud Light, was responsible for this commercial. Apparently they're totally different.\n","Title":"Bud Light's Super Bowl ad puts a man in the middle of a life-size Pac-Man game | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
