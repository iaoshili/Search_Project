{"Main text":"HBO available on Sling TV starting today\nIf you want HBO, your Sling subscription will now cost $35\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHBO can be yours on Sling TV starting today if you're willing to pay  the extra $15 fee each month . Add that on top of Sling's $20 subscription price and you'll get both the linear, live HBO channel plus a video-on-demand section that's the same sort of thing cable providers offer. Sling says that HBO is available across all devices that support the internet TV service today; those include Roku, Xbox One, Fire TV, iOS, Android, PC, and Mac.\nYou can stream HBO on three devices at once\nHere's where it gets a bit interesting: since you can't use the HBO Go app as a Sling customer (Sling says you shouldn't need to since everything's right in its own app), the company is upping the number of simultaneous streams it's allowing. But only for HBO. Normally Sling TV enforces a single-stream limit, so you're restricted to watching it on one device at all times. But you'll be able to stream HBO on up to three devices simultaneously. This is probably a modest attempt on Dish's part to make up for the lack of proper HBO Go support. Sling says this new multi-stream functionality will be added to customer accounts \"on a rolling basis starting today.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
