{"Main text":"Jamie XX shares his new track Loud Places, featuring The xx's Romy Croft\nHis debut album In Colour arrives in June\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's hard to believe that there hasn't been a Jamie XX solo album yet, but the kid's been busy \u2014 two albums with his day job The xx, popping up at seemingly every festival on God's green earth, and remixing everyone from Radiohead to Adele. After releasing two indispensable summer soundtrack songs last year \u2014 \" Sleep\/Sound \" and \" All Under One Roof Raving \" \u2014 he finally announced the album those tracks will find a home on. In Colour will drop some time in June on Young Turks, and in the meantime we get another sample courtesy of the BBC: \"Loud Places,\" featuring his xx counterpart Romy Madley Croft.\nSo what keeps a Jamie xx song featuring Romy from just being an xx song? The answer is obvious enough once the song hits its first peak, a perfect deployment of a sample and hand claps, elevating Romy's whispery vocal to something warmer and universal. While xx songs tend to look inward, Jamie's solo production reaches out to the crowd, finding some quietude in even the loudest of places.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
