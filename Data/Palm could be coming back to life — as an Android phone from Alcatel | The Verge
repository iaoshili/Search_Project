{"Main text":"Palm could be coming back to life \u2014 as an Android phone from Alcatel\nThe resurrection of Palm may be upon us\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere was a time in the last 15 years when the main mobile device people used wasn't an iPhone, or made by BlackBerry. Palm was the company changing the lives of people on the go with its line of popular PDAs. Palm's Treo smartphones were well regarded, but by the time the smartphone revolution was in full swing, it was falling behind. It ended up making an earnest run with WebOS \u2014 but a botched sale to HP finally sealed the company's fate.\nThe company as we knew it was put down by HP back in 2011, but Palm's trademark may be gracing smartphones in the near future. If you head over to  palm.com , you will be redirected to a new site, mynewpalm.com, which carries the slogan \"smart move.\" According to documents unearthed by the Palm diehards at  WebOS Nation , HP  sold the Palm trademark to a shell company owned by Nicolas Zibell last month. Zibell also happens to hold the title of President, Americas and Pacific at Alcatel One Touch, the mobile phone maker. Alcatel's slogan is \"smart move.\"\nThis could be the first signal that Palm may not be out of the smartphone game for much longer. If new Palm phones are made, it's doubtful they will run WebOS, which  HP sold to LG last year. That means new Palm devices will likely be running Android, a fact that may upset the few remaining WebOS fans. While Alcatel \u2014 owned by Chinese electronics giant TCL \u2014 has sold more than 300 million handsets, it doesn't have a notable footprint in the US outside of feature phones and low-end Android devices. The Palm trademark could help change that. Palm still has strong brand recognition in the US and Europe, something which Alcatel \u2014 hasn't been able to achieve on its own.\n","Title":"Palm could be coming back to life \u2014 as an Android phone from Alcatel | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
