{"Main text":"Tech\n12 Monkeys television series will synchronize with Hue home lighting\nSyfy\u2019s original series is the first with a 'light track' that adjusts room lighting to on-screen action\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOwners of Philips Hue light bulbs will have the chance to experience something rather unique with the premiere of  12 Monkeys on Friday, January 16th. The Syfy original drama based upon the 1995 Terry Gilliam film will feature a \"light track\" that marries the action on the screen to the lighting in your room. Not just once, but for the entirety of the 13-episode season.\nThis isn\u2019t the first collaboration between Syfy and Philips. Sharknado 2 also  featured live synchronized Hue lighting when it premiered in July.\nThe transmedia lighting experience is controlled by the Syfy Sync app which connects to the Hue bridge and translates audio cues into web-enabled lighting commands. The result is room lighting that helps strike the right mood, with bulbs changing colors to better immerse the viewer in the on-screen action, akin to the effect achieved by those Philips-branded  Ambilight televisions that always look neat but few people buy.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
