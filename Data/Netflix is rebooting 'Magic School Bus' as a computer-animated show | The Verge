{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix has resurrected popular '90s children's series The Magic School Bus for its latest push into original kids programming. The streaming service will release 26 episodes of the reimagined show, now called The Magic School Bus 360, beginning in 2016. Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, told The New York Times that the original series ranks as one of the most popular educational programs in his company's catalog \u2014 despite the fact that new episodes were last produced in 1997. \"It teaches science in a way that transcends generations.\" Sarandos said. Magic School Bus debuted on PBS 20 years ago and urged young viewers to expand their science knowledge. Just like the groundbreaking original, this one's being produced entirely by Scholastic Media.\nA much different generation awaits the reboot, and Scholastic has modernized The Magic School Bus 360 accordingly. That all starts with the animation, which will now be computer generated. The bus will be different and fitted with upgraded technology, and the students will gain access to \"the latest tech innovations such as robotics, wearables and camera technology.\" Sarandos said he hopes it will be the first of many future collaborations between Netflix and Scholastic. Netflix is already working on numerous kids shows with DreamWorks Animation that will eventually join Turbo Fast, the series that debuted last December. Those new programs will be based around popular franchises like Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon.\n","Title":"Netflix is rebooting 'Magic School Bus' as a computer-animated show | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","entertainment"]}
