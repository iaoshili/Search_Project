Former 20th Century Fox head Tom Rothman has been named as Pascal's replacement, where he'll serve as the chair of Sony's Motion Picture Group.\nRothman is a Hollywood veteran, having been at Fox for nearly two decades. There he oversaw huge blockbusters like Titanic, Avatar, and the X-Men franchise. He left in 2012, and joined Sony in 2013 to bring the company's TriStar movie label back to life. TriStar subsequently co-produced films like Elysium and the Evil Dead reboot.\nRothman oversaw 'Titanic' and 'Avatar'\nVariety reports that some of the other candidates that were up for the gig included Michael De Luca, Sony's current president of production, and Doug Belgrad, president of Sony's Motion Picture Group. Belgrad, however, was considered to be one of Pascal's top lieutenants \u2014 not an asset when Sony was no doubt looking for a change. De Luca and Belgrad are staying with Sony Pictures, according to reports, and Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has also extended his contract.\nAs for what this will mean at the theaters, the answer is likely to be a strategic move towards as many blockbuster-ready films as possible, made as cheaply as possible. \"We're going to be lean and mean and efficient, and my job is to make hits,\" Rothman said when he first signed up with TriStar , and with Sony now focusing on making its divisions profitable \u2014  or else \u2014 he seems tailor-made for the bigger job. Amy Pascal, on the other hand, was known for taking creative risks; it's not like a movie about Mark Zuckerberg was a sure thing by any stretch of the imagination. And while sometimes those paid off (The Social Network, Zero Dark Thirty) Pascal struggled in recent years with big-budget blockbusters (White House Down, After Earth, and what's probably best described as \"The Spider-Man Debacle\").\nRothman will have a lot of catching up to do, but he's already got one ace up his sleeve: the new  Spider-Man the company is co-producing with Marvel .\n","Title":"Sony Motion Picture Group names new chairman after hacking embarrassment | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
