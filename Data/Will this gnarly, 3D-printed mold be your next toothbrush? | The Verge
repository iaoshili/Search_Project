It looks absolutely terrifying, but its maker, Blizzident, says it should have a revolutionary level of efficiency, claiming it'll take just six seconds to properly brush your teeth when using one.\nFloss zigzags between every single tooth along form-fitting hooks\nThough the prospect of putting the company'sÂ  eponymous toothbrush in your mouth may seem horrifying, Blizzident says it should fit perfectly, and it really ought to: its toothbrushes are all custom-made to precisely form to the shape of each customer's mouth. Molds are all created by taking a 3D scan of someone's teeth, and then modifying a toothbrush to fit around them. They're then 3D printed as a plastic mold and embedded with about 400 bristles.\nWhile Blizzident's speed claims may seem unlikely, it has a reasonable enough explanation for how they're achieved: its toothbrush is cleaning an entire mouthful of teeth at once. The toothbrush is meant to be bitten down and grinded on, while the bristles \u2014 all pointed directly toward your teeth at 45 degree angles \u2014 quickly swipe away at grime. A circular handle on the front of each toothbrush doubles as a storage holder for floss, which Blizzident says can be looped perfectly between each tooth thanks to form-fitting hooks that it builds into the mold.\nThough you'll have to provide your own 3D scan, Blizzident is already starting to sell the toothbrushes. Your first brush will cost $299 to account for both printing and customizing the model. And naturally, you'll need to replace it as the bristles wear down \u2014 Blizzident suggests about once per year \u2014 though it's only charging $159 for additional brushes. It's a wild idea nonetheless, though whether the brush can live up to its lofty claims of quick and thorough dental hygiene is another matter entirely.\n","Title":"Will this gnarly, 3D-printed mold be your next toothbrush? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","concepts","design"]}
