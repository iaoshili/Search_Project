Actor and comedian Norm MacDonald contributed a remembrance that may be the sweetest Williams story yet, involving a terrified MacDonald about to perform for David Letterman for the first time. Williams had never met MacDonald, and yet he stopped by his dressing room and improvised a bit for the ages. MacDonald  recounted the tale on Twitter , and it follows in chronological order below.\nIt was my first stand-up appearance on Letterman and I had to follow the funniest man in the world. #RIPRobinWilliams\n\u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) August 12, 2014\nI was a punk kid from rural Ontario and I was in my dressing room, terrified. #RIPRobinWilliams\n\u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) August 12, 2014\nI was on the phone to a friend back home when the funniest man in the world ambled by. #RIPRobinWilliams\n\u2014 Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) August 12, 2014\nThere was no one else on the floor.
