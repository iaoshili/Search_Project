Tim Cook doesn't plan to just sit on what he's received from Apple, however.Â  According to Fortune , Cook intends to give away all of his wealth, aside from what will presumably be a very small portion used to put his nephew through college.\n\"You want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripple for change.\"\nHe plans to use the money for philanthropy. Fortune doesn't say for what causes exactly, but it mentions that human rights, immigration reform, and stopping HIV transmission have been among the issues that Cook has spoken out on. Increasingly, he's used his position at Apple as a platform to advocate for issues important to him. \"You want to be the pebble in the pond that creates the ripple for change,\" he tells Fortune.\nCook's plan is not unique among those who have become wealthy in the tech sphere. Bill Gates, notably, even helped to launch the Giving Pledge \u2014 a pledge encouraging the wealthiest people in the world to give the majority of their wealth away to charity. Fortune reports that Cook currently has a net worth of $120 million and is also holding restricted stock that, if fully vested, would be worth another $665 million. Cook has reportedly already starting making quiet donations, but Fortune says that he eventually plans to figure out a more \"systematic\" approach.\nVerge Interviews: Bill Gates on how the world will change by 2030\n","Title":"Tim Cook plans to use his entire fortune for philanthropy | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture"]}
