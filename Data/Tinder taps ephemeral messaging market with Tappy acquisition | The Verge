{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTinder has made its first ever business match,  acquiring ephemeral messaging app Tappy for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition is aimed at helping the dating app add some depth to its hugely popular matchmaking services. Although users love Tinder's swipe-based mechanics (the company recently hit the  5 billion match mark \u2014 swift growth from 1 billion matches in March last year), Tinder CEO and co-founder Sean Rad says that the difficulty is improving the quality of matches. Ironically it seems that Tappy \u2014 an app which forces users to start every interaction with a photo and deletes conversations every 24 hours \u2014 could be the answer.\n\"We want to broaden the reasons for connecting in the first place.\"\n\"We\u2019re very good at connecting people, but there\u2019s this \u2018what happens after that?\u2019 moment that we want to improve,\" Rad  told TechCrunch . \"We not only want to get better at the way we use criteria to connect people, but we want to broaden the reasons for connecting in the first place. The Tappy team will help us tackle both fronts, the pre-match experience of creating that first connection and the post-match experience of communicating with that person.\"\nIt's likely that Tappy\u2019s expertise will be used to expand  Tinder Moments , an update to the dating app released last June that lets users broadcast photos to matches. Using Moments, users can draw on their photos and add captions and filters \u2014 all in the hope that an extra flash of social media peacocking will attract the right date. Tappy's engineers could expand this functionality (perhaps adding direct photo messaging) and maybe even help Tinder take its relationship with its users up a level \u2014 from dating app to social media messenger.\n","Title":"Tinder taps ephemeral messaging market with Tappy acquisition | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
