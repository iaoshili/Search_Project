{"Main text":"Microsoft reveals Windows 10 will ship with two browsers\nSpartan and Internet Explorer\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft unveiled its new Windows 10 browser,  codenamed Spartan , at a press event yesterday, but the company didn\u2019t discuss the fate of Internet Explorer. While Spartan is a new modern browser, Internet Explorer isn\u2019t going away just yet. In a  blog post detailing some of the changes with Spartan, Microsoft confirms that Windows 10 will ship with two browsers. \"We recognize some enterprises have legacy web sites that use older technologies designed only for Internet Explorer, such as custom ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects,\" says Jason Weber, program manager of Internet Explorer. \"For these users, Internet Explorer will also be available on Windows 10.\"\nInternet Explorer will use the same \"dual rendering engines\" as Spartan, but it\u2019s clearly positioned as a browser simply for legacy support. It\u2019s not clear exactly how this will be implemented in the final version of Windows 10, but it\u2019s possible Microsoft may choose to only ship Internet Explorer with enterprise copies of the operating system. \"Windows 10 Enterprise Technical Preview with Internet Explorer\" could be seen on several screens at Microsoft\u2019s corporate campus yesterday, suggesting that a separate version of Windows 10 will ship with Internet Explorer.\nA version of Windows 10 WITH Internet Explorer explicitly. iiiiinteresting. pic.twitter.com\/Q3FWt2YuB2\n\u2014 Tom Warren (@tomwarren) January 21, 2015\nGiven the confusing mix of a desktop and \"Metro-style\" version of Internet Explorer in Windows 8, it would be equally confusing to have both Internet Explorer and Spartan visible to consumers in Windows 10. While Microsoft is clear Internet Explorer will be available on Windows 10, we suspect it will be limited or hidden away unless you really need it. Microsoft\u2019s confirmation also hints that its next browser will likely drop the Internet Explorer moniker, especially as the company is referring to each browser separately. Spartan is just a codename for now, but Microsoft sure does love its Halo references.\n","Title":"Microsoft reveals Windows 10 will ship with two browsers | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
