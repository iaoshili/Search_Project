{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFans who collectively donated $5.7 million on Kickstarter to make Veronica Mars were promised they'd be able to watch the movie online the same day it came out in theaters . But many were frustrated and disappointed when the only online option was Flixster, the Warner Brothers-owned distribution platform. After vocal complaints, the studio has decided to refund backers who purchase the film on iTunes or Amazon as well.\n\"I genuinely want today to be perfect for all of you.\"\n\"Flixster was the best option for getting the digital movie reward out to all of you, worldwide, at the same time,\" director Rob Thomas wrote yesterday when the film was released. \"But more than anything, I genuinely want today to be perfect for all of you... your movie came out worldwide, and I want you to be able to watch it on whatever platform or device works best for your needs.\"\nSome backers ran into technical difficulties with Flixster, which some users were unable to download; the service also doesn't work with Apple TV. Others just resented the fact that non-backers had more choices. The offer to repay backers buying the movie elsewhere seemed to pacify fans. \"Flixster is not working for a lot of people, myself included, but being able to buy the movie on preferred platform and send the receipt to get a refund is great,\" wrote backer Alex Collins.\n","Title":"After Flixster fail, Warner Brothers will refund 'Veronica Mars' backers using iTunes or Amazon | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
