{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGame of Thrones is just a month away from its season four premiere, and HBO is hoping to stoke fans' and newcomers' excitement with a little bit of music. Not music from the show though: it's reportedly releasing a 10-track mixtape featuring hip-hop and Latin-music artists rapping about the fantasy series. According to The Wall Street Journal , Common, Wale, and Big Boi \u2014 best known as half of Outkast \u2014 are among the 10 artists that HBO put together to create music about Game of Thrones for a record that's expected to debut online for free on Friday. With a nod to Kanye and Jay Z, the album will be titled \"Catch the Throne.\"\n\"I can bring you that Khaleesi heat.\"\nEach song on the album reportedly places hip-hop beats over samples of dialogue and orchestral music from the show. According to the Journal, some lyrics include: \"Dungeons, dragons, kings and queens,\" on Big Boi's track; \"I sit and think when I'm in my zone \/ This life is like a Game of Thrones,\" on Common's track; and \"I can bring you that Khaleesi heat \/ Use my King, knack for words, as an actual sword,\" on Wale's track. HBO declined to tell the Journal how much the artists were being paid.\nHBO's goal, the Journal reports, is to appeal to the African-American and Latino demographics. \"Our multicultural audiences are a very important part of our subscribers, and we don't want to take them for granted,\" Lucinda Martinez, an HBO multicultural marketing executive, tells the Journal. HBO reportedly began the project after discovering that a number of famous rappers were fans of the show. That doesn't include everyone on the mixtape, but apparently some are pretty into it: Big Boi is reportedly caught up on the series and has even started reading ahead in the books.\nUpdate: Big Boi's track from the album, \"Mother of Dragons,\" is now available toÂ  stream over at Pitchfork . Listen to it, and reorient your expectations from where the album's corny lyrics and concept may have initially set them.\n","Title":"There is going to be a 'Game of Thrones' rap album | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
