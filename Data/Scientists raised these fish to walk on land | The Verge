But for three McGill University researchers, it made perfect sense. How else would you find out what behavioral and physiological changes might have taken place when fish first made the move from sea to land over 400 million years ago?\n\"I used to look at fins and their motion, and I always thought it was so interesting and complex,\" says Emily Standen, lead author of a study published in Nature today, and an evolutionary biomechanics researcher who now works at the University of Ottawa. \"And then I thought, wow, how does that change from a fin to something that might work on land? That\u2019s how this project started.\"\nTo find out exactly what might have happened when aquatic animals first moved to land, Standen and her colleagues took 111 juvenile Polypterus senegalus \u2014 a fish species that goes by the common name Senegal bichir, or \"dinosaur eel\" \u2014 and raised them for eight months in a terrestrial environment. This environment consisted of mesh flooring covered in pebbles and just 3 millimeters of water \u2014 a precaution that, combined with water misters, prevented the fish from drying out. The researchers also formed a control group using 38 fish growing up in their usual aquatic environment.\n\"There\u2019s anecdotal evidence that they move on land.\"\n\"These fish have functional lungs and can breathe air,\" explains Standen. Dinosaur eels also have gills, but they breathe at the surface regularly to increase their oxygen supply. They also occasionally use their fins to walk on land. \"There\u2019s anecdotal evidence that they move on land from ephemeral pond to ephemeral pond [when they dry up],\" Standen says, \"but they don\u2019t do it voluntarily.\" Still, that was more than enough to attempt to raise these young fish on land.\n\"We used high-speed video to analyze their movements at the end of the eight-month period,\" Standen says. Because of time restraints, this part of the analysis was carried out in 20 of the terrestrial fish and 10 of the aquatic fish. The researchers also killed and scanned individuals from both groups to look at how living on land had affected their skeletons.\nAs it turns out, growing up on land really does change how a fish walks.\nGrowing up on land really does change how a fish walks\n\"Fish raised on land walk with a more effective gait,\" Standen says. \"They plant their legs closer to the body\u2019s midline, they lift their heads higher, and they slip less during that walking cycle.\" The fish raised on land were also generally more consistent in the way they walked than their aquatic counterparts. But their behavior wasn\u2019t the only thing that changed. For example, \"the bones in the pectoral girdle \u2014 the bones that support the fins \u2014 changed their shape,\" she says. \"And their clavicles became elongated.\" Most changes that occurred were ones that gave their heads and fins more room to move around.\n\"It\u2019s an important change, because if you think of a terrestrial lifestyle,\" Standen explains, \"you actually need a neck on land because you\u2019re stuck on this plane, and you need to have more head motion that\u2019s independent from the body.\"\n\"they lift their heads higher, and they slip less.\"\nYet, the experimental nature of this study does limit some conclusions the researchers can draw. For one thing, the dinosaur eel isn\u2019t directly related to the fish species that first walked on land, such as the Eusthenopteron. \"We don\u2019t have a living ancestor of the fish we\u2019re interested in,\" Standen explains. Instead the scientists went with the next best thing: a species that\u2019s physically similar to the fossils from that period. \"It\u2019s a great model because it\u2019s elongate, has armor scales, and has ventral lateral pectoral fins\u201A which means its fins are at the side, close to the belly of the fish.\"\nDespite this limitation, Standen says it\u2019s exciting to think that we can use experiments on living animals to make inferences about what might have happened to physically similar animals during large scale evolutionary transitions. \"It seems quite clear that environmentally induced changes may have facilitated their transition to land,\" Standen says. \"Selective pressures then acted on these changes, and they became fixed in the genome over very long periods of time.\"\nStanden is now repeating the experiment with the hope of identifying changes in the fish\u2019s muscles. She would also like to look at what happens when the fish are kept on land for longer periods. \"It\u2019s quite possible that larger changes would occur if we kept them on land for longer,\" she says. \"The big dream is to do this over several generations.\"\n","Title":"Scientists raised these fish to walk on land | The Verge","Tags":["report","science"]}
