{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere it is, the first full-length trailer for Halo: Nightfall, the  live-action series coming to Xbox from executive producer Ridley Scott (i.e.  not the Steven Spielberg one ). We  got a tease in late July , but this video expands on that with a stronger glimpse at the characters and the world.\nHalo: Nightfall focuses on agent Jameson Locke, played by Mike Colter, and his investigation into a biological weapon affecting only humans. A multitude of classic weapons from the series seem to make an appearance, including an energy sword wielded by a Covenant soldier. There's actually two quick looks at the Covenant.\nAnd because it's a trailer for an action series, we can't help but notice all the key dramatic one-liners they manage to put in a 2:42 video. Some of our favorites:\n\"Death will come to all of us. Especially soldiers.\"\n\"We will not go out like this\"\n\"My question to you, Commander Locke. How will you lead \u2014 and for what?\nLocke will be playable in Halo 5: Guardians when it comes out late next year. Halo: Nightfall will be released November 11th with  Halo: The Master Chief Collection for Xbox One \u2014 which, since you asked, includes the following:\nHalo: Combat Evolved Anniversary (the remastered version from 2011)\nHalo 2 Anniversary (similarly remastered)\nHalo 3 (now 1080p and 60 frames per second)\nHalo 4 (ditto)\nAccess to Halo 5: Guardians multiplayer beta\nHalo: Nightfall\nThe first episode of Nightfall will reportedly premiere the day prior, November 10th, as part of the official HaloFest livestream .\n","Title":"Watch the full-length trailer for Ridley Scott's live-action 'Halo: Nightfall' | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
