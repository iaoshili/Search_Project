{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter years of legal wrangling, revenge porn pioneer Hunter Moore is finally headed to prison.  According to The Smoking Gun , Moore pled guilty to felony hacking charges today, as part of a plea bargain deal that leaves him facing as much as seven years in prison, with a mandatory minimum of two years. Additional fines and probation are still to be determined.  First arrested in January of 2014 , Moore is best known for founding the now-defunct Is Anyone Up, which drew traffic by posting nude pictures without the subject's consent. The site was accused of extortion numerous times, and in 2013, Moore lost a defamation suit over claims associated with the website.\nNotably, Moore is not being tried under a law that specifically targets revenge porn, although such laws have been passed in California and New Jersey. Instead, Moore was tried for paying accomplice Charles Evens to hack into specific computers so as to obtain more photos for the site. The indictment named nine different victims and six separate payments from Moore to Evens, paid as bounties for new material. Under the terms of the plea agreement, Moore's future access to computers will also be severely restricted, and prosecutors reserve the right to argue for a sentence outside of traditional federal guidelines.\n","Title":"Revenge porn magnate Hunter Moore will face up to seven years in prison | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
