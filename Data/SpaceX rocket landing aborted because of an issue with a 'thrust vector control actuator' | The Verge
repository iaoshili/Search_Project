{"Main text":"SpaceX rocket landing aborted because of an issue with a 'thrust vector control actuator'\nThe mission has been rescheduled\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne minute before SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was supposed to launch for a cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station this morning, SpaceX aborted the mission. The launch would have been its fifth mission to ISS, but its first attempt at landing a rocket on a barge out at sea. But because of an issue with a \"thrust vector control actuator,\" the launch and historic landing have now been delayed. The next attempt will be Friday morning at 5:09AM ET, NASA said, \"pending resolution of the issue.\"\nLaunch is scrubbed for today and we are now targeting launch on Jan. 9th at 5:09am ET. http:\/\/t.co\/hniEJZVl4k\n\u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) January 6, 2015\nThe launch was halted by the flight team because a thrust vector control actuator wasn't functioning correctly. The actuator was central to the landing mission and would have triggered an automatic abort if the team hadn't stepped in to stop the launch. This was the second delay for SpaceX's landing mission. In December, SpaceX delayed a launch prior to the actual attempt because of aÂ  problem with routine test-firing of the engine .\nAt 1:21 before launch, a thrust vector control actuator for the Falcon 9\u2019s 2nd stage failed to perform as expected. @SpaceX is evaluating.\n","Title":"SpaceX rocket landing aborted because of an issue with a 'thrust vector control actuator' | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
