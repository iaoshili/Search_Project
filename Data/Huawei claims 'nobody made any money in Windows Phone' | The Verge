{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHuawei revealed earlier this year that it was creating a dual-booting Windows Phone and Android handset for the US, before  ditching its plans a short time later . While the Chinese manufacturer never explained its backtracking, it\u2019s making its feeling for Windows Phone clear this week. In an  interview with The Seattle Times , Huawei\u2019s head of international media affairs, Joe Kelly, has revealed the company didn\u2019t make money from its two handsets running Windows Phone, and that \"nobody made any money in Windows Phone.\"\nA bold statement at a bad time for Microsoft\nThe bold statement comes just months after  Microsoft made Windows Phone free for device manufacturers, and more than a year after Huawei previously described Windows Phone as \"weak.\" Since then, Microsoft has also launched a web-based  hardware partner portal alongside Windows Phone 8.1 , allowing smaller device manufacturers, stores, and operators to create white-label Windows Phone devices with low specifications and low prices. Microsoft is trying to boost Windows Phone sales and usage through this and many other efforts.\nMicrosoft also announced new Windows Phone partnerships with Chinese manufacturers like Foxconn, Lenovo, Longcheer, and ZTE earlier this year, and Huawei appears to be the first existing partner to put its plans on hold for future Microsoft-powered devices. Huawei\u2019s comments come just as Microsoft is desperately trying to tempt more device manufacturers to adopt its mobile operating system amid its ongoing struggle to compete with Android.\n","Title":"Huawei claims 'nobody made any money in Windows Phone' | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tech"]}
