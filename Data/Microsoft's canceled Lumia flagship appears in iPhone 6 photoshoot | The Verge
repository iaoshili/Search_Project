{"Main text":"Microsoft's canceled Lumia flagship appears in iPhone 6 photoshoot\nNo Lumia 1030 just yet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft was originally planning to  release a new Lumia flagship Windows Phone with a huge camera bump in time for the holidays. The device, known as codenamed McLaren, would have been the first to use Microsoft\u2019s new  Kinect-like 3D Touch gestures that the company is developing.  Photos of McLaren leaked last weekend , and The Verge can confirm they\u2019re genuine and that the device is simply a canceled prototype. The wait continues for Microsoft\u2019s next flagship Windows Phone.\nNew photos have been  published today , showing McLaren in every possible angle. The aluminum device runs Windows Phone 8.1 with on-screen buttons, alongside 2GB of RAM and what appears to be a 5-inch 1080p display. Compared to the iPhone 6, the camera bump on McLaren is clearly significant, but it\u2019s not a 50-megapixel shooter as some have speculated. Sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the device was designed to look like a successor to the Lumia 1020, but that the camera was around 20 megapixels in reality and similar to the Lumia 930 and Lumia 1520.\nNext\nWhile McLaren was largely focused on upcoming 3D Touch features for Windows Phone, Microsoft is still working on the basic concepts to enable additional gestures across its operating system. Some of those will debut in the phone version of Windows 10, and Microsoft may choose to detail some of that work at an upcoming  consumer-focused event in January.  Windows Central reports that an exploding Live Tile view, codenamed MixView, will be available in Windows 10, allowing users to hover over a tile to reveal additional actions that are relevant to that particular app.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
