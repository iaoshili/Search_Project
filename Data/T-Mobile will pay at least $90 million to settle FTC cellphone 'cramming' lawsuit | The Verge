{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nT-Mobile has agreed to pay at least $90 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the wireless carrier of placing unwanted, third-party charges on its customers cell phone bills, a practice commonly referred to as \"cramming.\" The FTC  filed its suit back in July , claiming that T-Mobile charged unwitting customers fees for \"premium\" SMS-based services that offered junk content like flirting tips, horoscope information, or celebrity gossip. These services typically cost $9.99 a month; T-Mobile is now required to pay back all affected customers. In addition to paying that sum back, the carrier will also have to pay $18 million in fines to the attorneys general of all 50 states as well as another $4.5 million directly to the FTC.\n\"Today's settlement is a win for consumers who have been victimized by cramming,\" said FCC chairman Tom Wheeler  in a statement . \"It means compensation for T-Mobile customers who were fraudulently billed for third-party services that they did not want or authorize. And it goes one step further. Today's action will also help protect all of T-Mobile's customers from bogus third-party charges in the future.\"\nT-Mobile is hardly the only carrier under scrutiny for such practices \u2014 earlier this fall, AT&T  settled its own FTC lawsuit for $105 million . Similar to this T-Mobile lawsuit, most of that money is going back to consumers, with similar fees being paid to the states and FTC. And it looks like  Sprint may be next \u2014 reports indicated that the FTC would bring another $105 million lawsuit against the carrier, though the suit hasn't officially be filed just yet.\n","Title":"T-Mobile will pay at least $90 million to settle FTC cellphone 'cramming' lawsuit | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","us-world","tech"]}
