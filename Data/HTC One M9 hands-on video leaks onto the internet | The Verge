{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHTC's new flagship, the One M9, will be anything but a surprise when it is announced tomorrow at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. After a number of  major leaks , a hands-on video of the new device has found its way onto the internet.\nLeaks steal HTC's thunder\nThe video confirms everything we already knew: the M9 looks much like its predecessor, the HTC One M8, though the dual-camera setup has been scrapped and the front-facing camera has been beefed up with the company's \"Ultrapixel\" technology to take better selfies in low light. There are a handful of minor cosmetic changes; the power button has been moved from the top edge to the side, and the unibody design now employs a two-tone look. We should expect refreshed internals as well.\nIt seems the video was recorded during an embargoed press event, which tech companies often use to show off new devices to the media ahead of their official unveiling. Those who attend such meetings are contractually prohibited from revealing details before a set date and time. Unfortunately for HTC, it appears this video accidentally found its way onto the internet.\nWhile the similarities to the One M8 may be disappointing for some HTC fans,  we are reserving our judgment until we get the device into our own hands. Who knows \u2014 the M8 was a wonderful phone, and these changes could be just what HTC needed to make a truly spectacular device.\n","Title":"HTC One M9 hands-on video leaks onto the internet | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech","mwc-2015"]}
