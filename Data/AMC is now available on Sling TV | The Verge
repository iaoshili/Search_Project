{"Main text":"AMC is now available on Sling TV\nPlus IFC and a whole bunch of EPIX channels\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nStarting today, Sling TV subscribers can watch AMC and its marquee shows including The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Mad Men. You don't need to pay anything extra for AMC; it's joining Sling's core channel lineup. That $20 package also bundles ESPN, CNN, TNT, TBS, Disney Channel, and other networks. AMC was a noticeable holdout when the Dish-owned internet TV service launched earlier this year, but both sidesÂ  quickly reached a deal and in February announced that AMC was on the way. IFC, another channel covered in that agreement, is also launching on Sling TV today. And like AMC, it costs nothing extra.\nFurther, Sling has also launched its fourth $5 content add-on pack, and this one's called \"Hollywood Extra.\" It includes EPIX, EPIX 2, EPIX3, EPIX Drive In, and Sundance TV. Like the previous kids, sports, and news packs, this one adds $5 onto Sling's regular monthly subscription. It too is available starting right now.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
