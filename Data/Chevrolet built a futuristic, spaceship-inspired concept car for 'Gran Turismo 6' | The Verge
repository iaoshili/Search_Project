The car, dubbed the Chaparral 2X Vision Gran Tursimo (VGT), will be available as downloadable content in the PlayStation 3 game later this holiday season. It was designed through a collaboration between Chevrolet Research and Development and Chaparral Racing, and it features a propulsion system based on technology that could one day be used in spaceships.\nThe whole thing sounds pretty insane, with the car featuring \"a mid-mounted laser beamed-energy propulsion system, which pulses beams of light that focus in a shroud, creating shock waves that generate tremendous thrust.\" It features 900 horsepower worth of thrust, a top in-game speed of 240 miles per hour, and can go 0-60 in 1.5 seconds. \"This is a fantasy car by design,\" says Frank Saucedo, who led the concept design team. Even crazier, you don't sit in the car, but instead lie face down with your arms and legs spread towards the wheels. \"Think of it as adapting a wing suit to a racing car,\" says Saucedo, \"where the driver\u2019s movements control certain aspects of the aero package.\"\nThe Chaparral 2X VGT joins other fantastic racing concepts from the likes of Mercedes-Benz , Toyota , and Nissan , as part of the Vision Gran Turismo project.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Chevrolet built a futuristic, spaceship-inspired concept car for 'Gran Turismo 6' | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","photo-essay","transportation\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7692162"]}
