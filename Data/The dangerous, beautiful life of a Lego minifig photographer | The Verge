{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUK-based photographer Andrew Whyte specializes in dramatic light art and long exposures of the night sky, but some of his most striking work involves helping an inch-high fellow photographer get a good shot. For over a year, Whyte has been shooting what he calls the \" Legography \" series, starring a Lego minifig with a bulky black camera and a penchant for exploration. The minifig travels with Whyte, waiting to be posed scaling a fence, watching the sunrise, or playing tourist in London.\nIn order to allow for some portability and spontaneity, the Legography series is shot on an iPhone, initially the 4S and now the 5S. Whyte uses the app 645 Pro to get more manual control over his shots than the default camera software would allow, then processes them in Snapseed before uploading them to the Legography Facebook page . \"As an exploration of mobile photography, the project was very enlightening and quite liberating \u2014 to know I could be just about anywhere and still keep on top of things,\" says Whyte. The rest of his photography can be found at Long Exposures .\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n\"Having reviewed my archives, this took 19 attempts to capture the camera drop in the right position.\"\n\"The iPhone 4S's only real weak spot was image quality in low light; even so, results from twilight were acceptable.\"\n\"I've become the subject of other tourist's shots in several key locations, as I work at ground level to create Legography images.\"\n\"Our weather turned grim towards the year end but the series continued, and due to various considerations like low-light performance and compositional perspectives, it mostly continued outside. A raincoat was in order.\"\n\"I've suffered broken equipment, got injured, and been chased by wild animals in the course of my photography so it was fun to relay some of those experiences from the character's perspective.\"\n\"Hometown is Portsmouth, the UK's only island city. The beach and seaside-ness featured highly in the series and although it's known as a pebble beach, with the photography focusing on such small areas a small patch of sand could give the impression of a grand vista.\"\n\"Whilst the minifigure was quite posable the facial expressions were unchanging so it really worked that I was able to shoot over the figure's shoulder to avoid his face. This was his only 'selfie,' taken during Movember!\"\n\"The one thing I longed for was a decent long exposure app. Just two weeks before the end of the year, upgrades to SlowShutter Cam made that a reality. The app received focus and exposure locks, finally making it useable in dark conditions.\"\n\"The day before this had been very flat so to liven things up I'd run the image through every filter in Snapseed. Frankly, the result was a mess! Serendipity occurred next morning when I caught this scene without the need for further editing.\"\n\"The original figure still soldiers on but I built quite a collection of legs, torsos and hats over the year, giving me the freedom to change his outfit daily.\"\n","Title":"The dangerous, beautiful life of a Lego minifig photographer | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
