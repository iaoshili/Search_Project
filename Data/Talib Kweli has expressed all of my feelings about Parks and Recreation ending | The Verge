{"Main text":"Talib Kweli has expressed all of my feelings about Parks and Recreation ending\nReflection Eternal\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe were going to write a PSA anyway to let you know that Parks & Recreation is ending its seven-season run tonight at 10PM on NBC (schedule around Twitter accordingly), even though technically the season itself takes places two years in the future so it doesn't \"end\" until 2017. That's when we noticed hip-hop icon Talib Kweli was having the same feels as we were. So take it away:\nA photo posted by Talib Kweli (@talibkweli) on\nFeb 24, 2015 at 7:43am PST\n\u2014 Talib Kweli Greene (@TalibKweli) February 24, 2015\nTo the cast of Parks and Rec. I slept on season 1. I never thought a show abt an Indiana Parks Dept could be so great. I was wrong.\n\u2014 Talib Kweli Greene (@TalibKweli) February 24, 2015\nParks and Recs has given me so much joy over the years. Sad to see it go but happy I got to watch. RIP Harris Wittels.\n\u2014 Talib Kweli Greene (@TalibKweli) February 24, 2015\nAt least we still have Broad City.
