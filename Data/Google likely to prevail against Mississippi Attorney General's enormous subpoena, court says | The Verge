{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA federal court in Mississippi is convinced so far that Google will prevail against the state's attorney general in a lawsuit over an allegedly burdensome and over-broad subpoena. Google filed the suit a week after  The Verge published a report tying Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood to a secret Hollywood campaign to fight Google, pinning blame on it for piracy. Hood had handed Google a 79-page-long subpoena requesting a wealth of information and interviews, which Google is now fighting back against on grounds that it violates its First and Fourth Amendment rights.\n\"The Attorney General\u2019s interference ...would likely produce a chilling effect.\"\nThe court  granted Google a preliminary injunction against the attorney general earlier this month, and that's now being elaborated on in an order issued Friday. The court says that it believes Google has demonstrated a \"substantial likelihood\" that it will prevail on its First Amendment claims and that Google's Fourth Amendment claim has \"substantial merit.\" This isn't necessarily a surprise \u2014 Google appeared to have a strong case, and a \"substantial\" chance at prevailing in a case is necessary for this kind of injunction \u2014 but the court's language emphasizes why it's critical here.\nLegal precedent suggests that Google's interpretation law \u2014 particularly that search engines are generally protected from liability in the type of piracy cases that Hood is complaining about \u2014 is likely correct. \"The attorney general\u2019s interference with Google\u2019s judgment, particularly in the form of threats of legal action and an unduly burdensome subpoena, then, would likely produce a chilling effect on Google\u2019s protected speech, thereby violating Google\u2019s First Amendment rights,\" the court writes.\nThe court also notes that the attorney general may not threaten prosecution because Google is using its First Amendment rights. The court writes, \"Google has submitted competent evidence showing that the attorney general issued the subpoena in retaliation for Google\u2019s likely protected speech, namely its publication of content created by third parties.\"\nOf course, this is only the court's initial thoughts and may have no bearing on its final ruling. But it suggests that the court is strongly on Google's side for now. In response to the order, the Electronic Frontier Foundation  writes that , \"although the case is far from over \u2014 this is just a preliminary order \u2014 the court\u2019s recognition of Google\u2019s rights under the First Amendment and the [Communications Decency Act] is encouraging, and important for the overall health of the internet.\"\nhttps:\/\/www.eff.org\/files\/2015\/03\/28\/hoodorder_copy.pdf\n","Title":"Google likely to prevail against Mississippi Attorney General's enormous subpoena, court says | The Verge","Tags":["google","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7166326"]}
