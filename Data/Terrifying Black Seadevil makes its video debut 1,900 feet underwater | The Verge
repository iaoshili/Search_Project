{"Main text":"Terrifying Black Seadevil makes its video debut 1,900 feet underwater\nScientists record the same anglerfish that terrorized Nemo\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nResearchers in California have  recorded rare images and video of a Black Seadevil \u2014 a mysterious and rather hideous female anglerfish that lives in some of the deepest corners of the ocean. The fish was observed on November 17th by scientist Bruce Robison and his team at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. To capture it on film, they sent a remotely operated vehicle named Don Ricketts into the Monterey Canyon, some 1,900 feet below the surface of the ocean.\nAnglerfish have been filmed fewer than six times before, but Robison  believes this is the first time it's ever been recorded alive at this depth. The female's most striking feature is a long pole that sticks out of her head, which is used to lure prey with its illuminated tip. They also have huge, fanged jaws capable of devouring larger prey, though at just 9 centimeters long, the fish isn't quite as terrifying as it may seem in photos.\nAnd if the Black Seadevil looks familiar, it's probably because of Pixar. The species  ambushed and almost devoured Nemo and Dory in the 2003 film Finding Nemo.\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly reported the depth at which the Black Seadevil was recorded. It has been corrected.\n","Title":"Terrifying Black Seadevil makes its video debut 1,900 feet underwater | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
