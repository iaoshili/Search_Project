{"Main text":"Already seen the most exciting films in theaters? There's still plenty to look forward to down the road. Come take a look with us at some of the latest trailers to hit the web.\n'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For'\nIt'll be hard to get too much of the new Sin City before it's released this August. This  recut trailer runs through the film's characters at their most stylized, with glowing eyes, comic-book backgrounds, and striking, declarative statements to make. If you weren't already excited, you should be now.\n'Crossbones'\nYou probably won't need much convincing on this one: John Malkovich stars as the notorious pirate Blackbeard in NBC's upcoming hourlong drama Crossbones. The 10-episode series premieres on May 30th, and its first trailer just debuted this week.\n'The Immigrant'\nThe Immigrant puts three amazing actors \u2014 Marion Cotillard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Jeremy Renner \u2014 all together for a tale of one woman's search for the American dream gone awry. The film screened at Cannes last year, and, as the trailer highlights, it's received some glowing reviews. It opens in a limited release next month.\n'LFO'\nLFO is a quiet sci-fi film about a man who discovers that he can hypnotize others using some strange frequencies of sound. His neighbors become his test subjects, and all of the dark and comic things that you can imagine him doing with them, he soon begins to do. This (mildly NSFW) trailer actually debuted last year, but it's finally been announced that the movie will head to the US this fall.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Crossbones,' 'The Immigrant,' and 'Sin City: A Dame to Kill For' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
