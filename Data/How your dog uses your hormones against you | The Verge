{"Main text":"How your dog uses your hormones against you\nMore evidence that dogs really are your fur-babies\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe bond between dogs and their humans is weirdly strong. Despite belonging to entirely different species, we treat them like family, and they really do seem to love us. When they stare at us \u2014 and we\u2019re not holding food \u2014 it feels real. It feels right.\nNow, we\u2019re one step closer to figuring out why that is. As it turns out, when humans gaze into their dogs\u2019 eyes, they experience a rise in oxytocin \u2014  a hormone linked to human bonding and some other, less cuddly behavior. Moreover, when dogs stare back at their humans, they experience a similar rise in oxytocin. Taken together, the findings hint that the reaction may have evolved simultaneously in both humans and dogs, as these animals were domesticated. It may also explain why humans and their dogs bond so tightly.\nAffection \"similar to that felt toward human family members.\"\n\"These results suggest that humans may feel affection for their companion dogs similar to that felt toward human family members,\" the researchers write in  the study , published today in Science. That's because when dogs make eye contact with their owners, they trigger biological signals similar to the ones that are activated when a mother looks at her child.\nTo figure out what role oxytocin plays in dog-human relationships, researchers conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, researchers compared oxytocin levels in urine belonging to 30 dogs and their owners before and after a 30-minute interaction. They also measured how long dogs and owners stared at each other, and how often they touched. Then, they did the same things with pairs of wolves and their owners; the wolves has been raised by humans their entire lives. The idea here was to see if undomesticated animals that are closely related to dogs would lead to the same result.\nCredit: AAAS\/Carla Schaffer\nThe researchers found that the dogs and their owners had increased levels of oxytocin in their urine after gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. This didn\u2019t occur in the wolves, or the humans who own them, however. Moreover, the owners whose dogs looked at them the most experienced the largest increase in oxytocin \u2014 an increase that their dogs mirrored.\nFemale dogs were more affected by the drug\nTo see if there was a causal relationship between the increase in oxytocin seen in the dogs and the increase seen in humans, the researchers conducted a second experiment. This time, they administered oxytocin \u2014 or a saline solution devoid of oxytocin \u2014 to the noses of a new group of 27 dogs. This didn't affect the male dogs. But in female dogs, researchers saw an increase in the amount of time they spent staring at their owners. Also, the dog owners experienced a larger-than-normal increase in their own oxytocin levels when they interacted with their doped-up female dogs.\nThe researchers aren\u2019t sure why female dogs were more affected by the oxytocin than the male dogs. This difference wasn\u2019t observed in the first experiment, so it\u2019s possible that female dogs are simply more sensitive to the artificial administration of the drug. There may also be some dog behaviors at work here that we don\u2019t quite understand yet; scientists will have to conduct more experiments like these to figure that out.\nOne thing to note, however, is that oxytocin hasn\u2019t just been linked to  caring , love, and trust. Some studies have linked it to  increased envy in humans, and decreased  cooperation . So, you probably shouldn\u2019t refer to it as the \"love hormone\" \u2014 as many have  in the past . That said, it does appear to play a role in human social interactions in general, regardless of whether the interactions are positive. And if this study stands the test of time, we\u2019ll probably be able to add dog-human bonding to the \"love\" side of the oxytocin list \u2014 which is a pretty ingenious evolutionary phenomenon, when you think about it.\nWhen dogs look at us \u2014 and we're not holding food \u2014 it feels real\nAfter all, the rise in oxytocin seen in humans when they look at their dog is pretty similar to the rise in oxytocin seen in mothers when they look at their kids. And humans who report feeling very satisfied with their dog-human relationship tend to maintain a mutual gaze with their pet for longer periods. This means that dogs, through domestication, may have figured out a way to insert themselves in a hormonal pathway that was once exclusive to humans. It\u2019s a neat biological and evolutionary trick \u2014 one that likely secured the dog\u2019s spot as humanity\u2019s \"best friend.\"\n","Title":"How your dog uses your hormones against you | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","science"]}
