{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt\u2019s official, Microsoft has acquired Sunrise, the maker of  one of the best calendar apps for iOS and Android . Rumors  suggested Microsoft was willing to pay $100 million for the purchase, but neither side is yet disclosing financial terms of the deal. Microsoft first made the news official with a new video posted to its YouTube page, later releasing a statement.  Sunrise's co-founders say the Microsoft pact is \"just the beginning\" of a promising future and are emphasizing that the current app will remain available on its current platforms. \"We're not going anywhere,\" the company said.\nThe move comes less than two months after Microsoft  acquired Acompli , a mail app for iOS and Android, and days after the software maker  rebranded that app as Outlook . Microsoft\u2019s Outlook app is now  one of the best email apps on Apple\u2019s iOS platform. \u201CToday\u2019s acquisition of Sunrise, our recent acquisition of Acompli and our new touch-optimized universal Office apps for Windows 10 all exemplify Microsoft\u2019s ambition to rethink the productivity category,\" said Rajesh Jha, corporate VP of Outlook and Office 365.\nSunrise supports a number of features you\u2019d want to organize events, including recurring appointments, alerts, birthdays, Google Maps directions, and more. Sunrise currently supports Gmail accounts and Facebook events \/ birthdays from the social network. The iOS and Android calendar app also integrates well with popular services like SongKick and TripIt to map upcoming gigs and help plan trips. There\u2019s even Foursquare integration to see a history of places you\u2019ve visited, and Evernote features to let you view reminders inside Sunrise. So Microsoft's interest in Sunrise is understandable, it's simply the Swiss Army knife of calendar apps.\nIt\u2019s not clear how Microsoft plans to use Sunrise in future, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect the company will fold the features into its Outlook app. Outlook on iOS and Android has its own calendar, but Sunrise\u2019s features are a lot more powerful so it would make a lot of sense to combine the two. The acquisition is yet another step in Microsoft's plan to own productivity across multiple platforms, and expand its mobile Office suite.\nVerge Video Archives: Sunrise - The best calendar app for iPhone (This Is My Next)\n","Title":"Microsoft acquires Sunrise, the best calendar app for iOS and Android | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","breaking","tech"]}
