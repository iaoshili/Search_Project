{"Main text":"Inside Tumblr and the battle for net neutrality\nThe day the internet sort of, but didn't really, stop\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt\u2019s Wednesday afternoon on Tumblr, and the internet is in a perpetual loading state. Starting early in the morning, users have been greeted with a cluster of spinning wheels in place of the normal dashboard. \u201CMake it stop,\u201D says a button at the top. Click it, and Mark Ruffalo will explain to you in a video why the FCC (represented whimsically by stock footage of Santa Claus) needs to stop cable companies (a man in a sweater and hard hat) from slowing down the internet (an exploding Earth, covered with a loading sign). Other sites have their own banners , glitchy videos, and explanations of why they\u2019re joining the Battle for the Net \u2014 an attempt to get Congress and the FCC to ban \u201Cfast lane\u201D deals between web services and broadband companies. By definition, every fast lane creates a slow lane, so protesters have coalesced around the loading \u201Cwheel of death\u201D to symbolize the effect.\nBut back at Tumblr\u2019s New York headquarters, the issue isn\u2019t quite settled yet. \u201CAre we aestheticizing this loader?\u201D muses designer Zack Sultan. \u201CAre we aestheticizing the iconography of our persecutors?\u201D\nCopywriter Tag Savage tentatively agrees. \u201CI think we are. It\u2019s now a totem.\u201D\n\u201CNow everybody wants the loader all the time.\u201D\n\"Are we aestheticizing the iconography of our persecutors?\"\nFrom there, they move on to explaining a documentary on Gore Vidal\u2019s Caligula. But a more serious question pervades the discussion: how do you compress a long and complicated policy fight into a single day and a single symbol? And how much does it matter?\nTumblr general counsel Ari Shahdadi helped instigate the day of action, which was organized by pro-net neutrality groups Demand Progress, Engine Advocacy, Fight for the Future, and the Free Press Action Fund. One floor up, he and public policy lead Liba Rubenstein have been monitoring feedback and directing the occasional tweak to the page \u2014 users were worried, for example, about the amount of information that an automated calling program gathered before putting them in touch with their Congressional representatives, and some seemed leery of even dialing in (\"Kids don\u2019t use phones to call people,\" Savage explains). But Shahdadi believes the overall response has been overwhelmingly positive, especially for something as difficult to explain as net neutrality.\nReclassify the net\n\"For SOPA\/PIPA it was just much easier,\" says Shahdadi, referencing the 2012 blackout campaign that has set the bar for internet activism ever since. \"You just had to get this bill to not get passed. Here it\u2019s like \u2014 oh, we need to convince an independent regulatory agency to promulgate rules under a certain authority that they haven\u2019t used before, and part of that is reclassifying, but then they have to forbear from certain\u2026 it starts getting byzantine and ridiculous.\"\n\"It starts getting byzantine and ridiculous.\"\nIt\u2019s the same problem that activists have had with things like NSA reform. But in this case, net neutrality supporters are pushing for a specific goal: getting the FCC to redefine broadband as a telecommunication service instead of an \"information\" one. This would give the agency more leeway to set net neutrality restrictions, and it would make it harder for ISPs to sue and get the rules thrown out in court \u2014 something Verizon managed to do to the old rules earlier this year. Title II reclassification, as it\u2019s called, could be politically disastrous for FCC chair Tom Wheeler; a former chair referred to the likely fallout as \"World War III.\" It\u2019s anathema to many Republicans, who say it would tie up companies in regulation and tempt the FCC to abuse its newly granted power. Wheeler has previously leaned towards using a more nebulous section of telecom law to justify his rules. But he\u2019s facing increasing pressure to change his mind.\nMarvin Ammori, a lawyer and activist who serves on the Board of Directors for several nonprofits, doesn\u2019t think the net neutrality fight is a sure win. But he also believes there\u2019s something of a public consensus on the issue. \"We have ten times more support right now than we did at this stage in the SOPA fight,\" he says, pointing to a highly favorable analysis of the record-breaking number of comments to the FCC. The main issue is creating an environment where Wheeler feels empowered to reclassify broadband, especially by getting Congressional support. \"In DC, the people to reach are sort of moderate and centrist conservatives,\" he says \u2014 liberals jumped on board early, and some conservatives will never be convinced. Title II includes more potentially restrictive rules like price controls, though the FCC isn\u2019t required to implement any of them. Libertarian-leaning nonprofit group TechFreedom, which organized its own day of action, warns it will \"trigger endless litigation, cripple investment, slow broadband deployment and upgrades, and thus harm underserved communities.\"\n'We love net neutrality' no longer cuts it\nAll of this is way, way more complicated than anything people probably saw during the day of action, although Tumblr and other participating sites linked out to more detailed information. Rubenstein points out that that \"net neutrality\" and the \"open internet\" have become nebulous phrases used even by cable companies themselves, so it\u2019s necessary to be a little more specific. \"If it\u2019s just about \u2018We love net neutrality,\u2019 that\u2019s not necessarily going to move the needle.\" Even so, the main focus is on what a world without meaningful net neutrality would be like.\nHence, the wheel.\nLiba Rubenstein and Ari Shahdadi of Tumblr.\nThe wheel of death\nThe ideas behind net neutrality have stayed relatively constant over time, but the way we talk about them is constantly evolving. From 2007 to 2010, when the FCC\u2019s Open Internet Order was adopted, the major threat was Comcast, which had been caught throttling BitTorrent traffic on its network. If Comcast could all but block an entire file transfer protocol, what else could it do? Would telecoms decide to degrade online phone services or other things that competed with their networks? As internet usage caps became more common, a more subtle form of discrimination emerged: ISPs could give certain services a boost by not counting their usage towards the monthly limit. Now, the issue isn\u2019t whether ISPs could degrade a service. It\u2019s whether they could reserve their upgrades for paying customers, leaving the rest of the internet stuck in the past.\nThe minute a faster option is available, we'll adopt that as the norm\n\"The spinning wheel of death really was this incredibly simple way of crystallizing what the issue was without exaggerating,\" says Rubenstein. Poor-quality internet service is already a reality in many places, and the idea that \"fast lanes\" will kill the incentive to make it better isn\u2019t a far-fetched one. \"The idea that the standard that we have now will always be the standard that we feel comfortable with, and that the minute a faster option is available we won\u2019t immediately adopt that as the norm, is just totally ignorant of the way the internet has worked since Day One,\" she says.\nOf course, it\u2019s still a big simplification. Netflix\u2019s ongoing fight with ISPs and the resulting congestion, for example, is a highly visible \"slowdown,\" and CEO Reed Hastings has been outspoken about the need for regulation. But no matter how easy it is to mention Netflix in the same breath as net neutrality, the problem isn\u2019t covered by the rules being proposed right now. The Open Internet framework has always covered the \"last mile\" between ISPs and individual subscribers, not traffic on the huge \"backbone\" cables of the internet, which Netflix is paying to improve.\nTwo million emails\nThe day of action isn\u2019t going to change minds \u2014 \"I think if you\u2019ve formed an opinion for or against [Title II], you\u2019re there. Okay, fine, you\u2019re done,\" says Shahdadi. But according to statistics gathered by Battle for the Net, it mobilized a lot of people, whether avowed supporters or simply internet users who were alerted by the banners. 22 hours into the day-long \"slowdown\" period, 286,192 people had called Congress and 2,167,092 sent emails. The FCC, which has already received 1.5 million net neutrality comments, got another 722,364 \u2014 enough to take down its servers. Over 10,000 websites participated by posting a \"loading\" widget or other notification, including Tumblr, Netflix, Vimeo, Kickstarter, Reddit, and Etsy.\nWhile it easily outstrips the similar NSA-focused Day We Fight Back, the Battle for the Net is not even close to SOPA levels . At this point, honestly, it\u2019s not clear that anything ever will be. What is clear is that net neutrality has mobilized the internet community in a way few policy issues can. Wheeler\u2019s draft has drawn more comments to the FCC than any docket in the agency\u2019s history.\n\"Your phone is the internet, and your appointments are the internet, and your friends are the internet.\"\n\"Last time we did this fight in 2010, and before that, the internet was a place you went to read articles, listen to music. It was sort of a media platform,\" says Ammori. \"Now it\u2019s become a platform for almost everything in our economy.\" In a way, we feel it less, and that makes it more important than ever. \"The internet is increasingly background, just this mesh that holds everything in your life together,\" says Savage. \"The issue becomes more personal every year. Theoretically in 2005, it might be like \u2018This place I go for this and this and this may suck a little more.\u2019 But now that your phone is the internet, and your appointments are the internet, and your friends are the internet, and everything is the internet, this kind of legislation would have a deeper impact on your everyday life.\"\n","Title":"Inside Tumblr and the battle for net neutrality | The Verge","Tags":["policy","report","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5416491","2775343"]}
