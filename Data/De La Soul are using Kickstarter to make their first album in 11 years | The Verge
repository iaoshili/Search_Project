{"Main text":"De La Soul are using Kickstarter to make their first album in 11 years\nJust me, myself, and a pledge goal of $110,000\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's weirdly humbling to see De La Soul \u2014 that is, Posdnous, Dave, and Maseo \u2014 explain in the simplest terms who they are in a Kickstarter description. The hip-hop trio is legendary, even if they never found the same commercial success as their contemporaries. (Worst-case, you know them for their Grammy Award-winning work on the Gorillaz track, \"Feel Good, inc.,\" but seriously, drop everything and listen to their back catalog.)\nNew De La Album!! Check out our Kickstarter page!! Support, Donate, Pre-Order you copy NOW!! https:\/\/t.co\/a5WXlmnOqe #delasoul\n\u2014 De La Soul (@WeAreDeLaSoul) March 30, 2015\n\"For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves.\"\nIt's been 11 years since the group has released a studio record ( mixtapes don't count ), and they're  funding it with Kickstarter . According to the page, the group has already recorded 200 hours worth of new samples, which will now form the basis of this album. \"For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves,\" proclaims the page. (Some relevant history: In 1989, De La Soul was sued by sixties pop band the Turtles for using an uncleared sample from their song \"You Showed Me.\" It was later settled out of court.) \"They had to create a new kind of lawyer to sue us,\" quipped Masseo in the Kickstarter video.\nCollaborators include Damon Albarn (Blur \/ Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and Talking Heads legend David Byrne, and the group promises more to come. The pledge rewards range from  $5 \"love bucks\" (...) and $15 for a digital copy of the album all the way up to $10,000 that'll get you a lot, lot, lot of De La Soul.\nThe album's estimated delivery? September 2015.\n","Title":"De La Soul are using Kickstarter to make their first album in 11 years | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","music"]}
