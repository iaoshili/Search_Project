{"Main text":"Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake are bigger than bigger on the new iPhones' sizes\nSo huge\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSize does matter, especially when your own is being called into question. The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and musician Justin Timberlake return in two Apple commercials, both of which are focused on the girth of the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. Of the two, \"Camera\" is subtler about  its opinion on mass . The aptly titled \"Huge,\" however, presents no illusions about its purpose. It has Fallon listing the advantages of the larger display while Timberlake breathlessly reminds viewers, again and again, that the new devices are \"huge.\"\nIt's a hilarious shift from Apple's 2012 paradigm, which evangelized the iPhone 5's relatively diminutive size in comparison to its more hefty competitors. The company even created an ad calling the screen size \"a dazzling display of common sense.\" Who knew that two years could change so much and yet so little?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
