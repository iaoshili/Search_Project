{"Main text":"Listen to the first song on Kanye West's new album\nWest has said his next album won't go in the same direction as Yeezus\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn the midst of his fashion show in New York City to unveil his  long-awaited collaboration with Adidas , Kanye West dropped some new music off his upcoming album. The song called \"Wolves\" featuring Vic Mensa and Sia and  reportedly co-produced by Cashmere Cat and Sinjin Hawke, is the first track on West's new album, which still has no release date. West has said his next album wouldn't necessarily follow the dark tone of Yeezus, and while still maintaining those familiar deep bass lines, \"Wolves\" feels a bit more fun. There are rumors of a tour with Rihanna this year, so it shouldn't be too long before we get a full body of work from Yeezus himself.\nA video posted by Off-White c\/o Virgil Abloh™ (@virgilabloh) on\nFeb 12, 2015 at 2:03pm PST\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
