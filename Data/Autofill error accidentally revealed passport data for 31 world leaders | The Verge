The mistake an Australian government official made is a bit worse. Passport and visa details for 31 world leaders who attended the last G20 summit (including President Obama) were sent to the wrong recipients.\nInstead of finding its way to another government agency, the data was sent to organizers of the Asian Cup, who quickly alerted the Australian immigration department of the embarrassing blunder. Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, and David Cameron were among the other leaders who unknowingly had their personal information slip out.\nIn a letterÂ  obtained by The Guardian , it was determined that the mistake could've been prevented if the sender had just double checked the message's recipient. \"The cause of the breach was human error,\" the letter reads. \"[Redacted] failed to check that the autofill function in Microsoft Outlook had entered the correct person\u2019s details into the email \u2018To\u2019 field.\" But lucky for the immigration department, this never turned into a real privacy or national security crisis. The Asian Cup committee said the email was promptly deleted \u2014 and they emptied the trash just to be sure it wouldn't be recovered. Apparently that was enough assurance for the agency to keep the breach a secret and not notify world leaders, a decision that's already stirred some controversy and may be in violation of privacy laws in some countries.\n","Title":"Autofill error accidentally revealed passport data for 31 world leaders | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
