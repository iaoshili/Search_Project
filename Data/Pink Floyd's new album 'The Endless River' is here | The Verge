{"Main text":"Pink Floyd's new album 'The Endless River' is here\nThe psychedelic rock pioneers set sail again\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPink Floyd fans  freaked out when they found out the legendary psychedelic rock band would be putting out a whole new album of previously unreleased music titled The Endless River. The  first single landed last week and only further stoked interest in the band's turn toward mostly instrumental songs (many of them originally recorded in 1993). Last night, it became the most-preordered album in history on  Amazon UK . Now the full album The Endless River is out on  iTunes and  Amazon and available for  streaming on Spotify and  Rdio . Take that,  Taylor Swift !\nOn top of that, the band has released a  new teaser music video today for \"Louder Than Words,\" the only lyrical song on the album. The video is fittingly surreal for the same band responsible for the classic 1982 film  The Wall , with haunting scenes of the environmentally devastated Aral Sea captured on location in a remote area on the border of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, as  Rolling Stone reports.\nPink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason discuss the album in another video released last week:\nAll of which means if you can't get in touch with your resident prog rock fan today, you'll know why.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
