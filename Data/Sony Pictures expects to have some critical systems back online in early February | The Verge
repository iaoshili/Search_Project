{"Main text":"Sony Pictures expects to have some critical systems back online in early February\nCyberattack probably won't have 'material' impact on earnings\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony has announced that it's applying for an extension of the deadline to submit its third-quarter securities report \"due to the amount of destruction and disruption that occurred\" following theÂ  massive cyberattack directed against its movie division. Sony Pictures shut down its network in response to the hack, but most of the financial systems and \"many other critical information technology applications\" won't be back online until early February. The Wall Street Journal reported at the end of December that the Sony Pictures network would be \" fully operating again within eight weeks \" if the company's systems stayed secure.\nAs such, the third-quarter earnings report will miss its originally scheduled date of February 4th. Sony will still release guidance and hold conferences on that date, so we should get some idea of how it performed during the important holiday quarter. The company doesn't believe the hack will make much difference to the bottom line, however. \"While Sony continues to evaluate the impact of the cyberattack on its financial results,\" it says in a statement, \"it currently believes that such impact is not material.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
