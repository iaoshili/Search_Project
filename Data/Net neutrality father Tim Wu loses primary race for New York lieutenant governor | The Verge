{"Main text":"Net neutrality father Tim Wu loses primary race for New York lieutenant governor\nThe tech hopeful didn't draw enough votes to best his rival this time\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTim Wu , a professor at Columbia Law School and freedom-of-information advocate who coined the phrase \"net neutrality\" back in 2003, lost his bid to become the next lieutenant governor of New York state tonight. According to  the Associated Press, Kathy Hocul, a former Republican Congressman and Wu's rival in the Democratic primary for the lieutenant governorship, drew over 60 percent of the tallied vote at the time of this post's publication. The candidate at the top of Wu's ticket, Zephyr Teachout, also lost her bid to replace sitting New York state governor Andrew Cuomo as the Democratic nominee in the upcoming November 4th general election.\nNEW YORK (AP) _ New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has defeated liberal challenger Zephyr Teachout in the state's Democratic Primary\n\u2014 Joel Siegel (@joelmsiegel) September 10, 2014\nThat\u2019s that, @AP calls Cuomo\/Hochul win the Democratic primary in New York http:\/\/t.co\/HLXjhjAFTw pic.twitter.com\/QWLndA9myH\n\u2014 Michael Roston (@michaelroston) September 10, 2014\nTeachout and Wu ran on an expressly  tech-friendly platform that would have sought to block the Comcast takeover of Time Warner Cable (a New York-based company), and would have made net neutrality state law.  Still, Teachout and Wu outperformed projections and may have acted as spoilers for Cuomo's speculated aims at higher office, including a 2016 presidential run. Alternate political futures may await them.\nAP Calls it for Cuomo. But Cuomo lost pretty big tonight. Both Teachout and Wu way over performed expectations. He's done as a national Dem.\n\u2014 phillip anderson (@phillipanderson) September 10, 2014\nTim Wu is winning Manhattan.
