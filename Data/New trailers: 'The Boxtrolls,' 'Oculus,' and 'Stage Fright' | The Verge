So set aside a few minutes, and let's check out some of the exciting new trailers to debut this week.\n'The Boxtrolls'\nThe studio behind Coraline is back with another adorably creepy stop-motion feature. The Boxtrolls promises charming slapstick comedy and adventure, and from the looks of it, the studio is in for yet another success. (And since you'll probably be wondering: that's Cee Lo Green's cover of \"(You're So Square) Baby, I Don't Care\" that'll be stuck in your head all day.)\nOculus\nWhen you start investigating a haunted object, you'd best be prepared for what's sure to come next. The results in Oculus are predictably spooky \u2014 enough so to scare some of its acting stiff. That's not necessarily reason to fear though: as the latest film from the production company behind Paranormal Activity and Insidious, there's a good chance that this will be among the most terrifying movies this year.\nStage Fright\nYou'd think murder would be enough to turn a musical performance into something a bit more dramatic, but that's not quite the case in Stage Fright. Instead, eccentric thespians and upbeat show tunes make for what looks to be a fun send up of the horror genre. And don't worry: it doesn't look a thing like the Scary Movie series.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'The Boxtrolls,' 'Oculus,' and 'Stage Fright' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
