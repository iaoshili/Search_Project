{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe list of music services that won't impact your data plan on T-Mobile is getting much longer today. The carrier has added Google Play Music, Xbox Music, SoundCloud, and 11 other music apps to its Music Freedom initiative. Those three are the big names, but T-Mobile says it's also added listening options for fans of EDM, jazz, Caribbean, and Bollywood-style music. \"Today we\u2019re taking another huge step toward our ultimate goal of including every streaming music service in the program,\" said T-Mobile CEO John Legere. \"Anyone can play. No one pays. And everyone wins.\" Even if companies aren't paying to participate, the  net neutrality concerns raised by Music Freedom remain just as valid now as they were when the program was announced in June.\nBut even if it's unpopular with net neutrality advocates, the \"Uncarrier 6.0\" reveal has proven a hit with consumers. T-Mobile says the number of customers streaming music on a daily basis has jumped 300 percent since Music Freedom's unveiling, and collectively they're listening to 66 million songs (roughly 200 terabytes) per day. And the company says Music Freedom is often a reason cited by people making the switch to T-Mobile. The carrier has been working to support Google Play Music and Xbox Music for a few months now; both services fared well in a public vote that T-Mobile said would influence which services would be added to Music Freedom. The full list of today's additions follows below.\nGoogle Play Music − Winner of the popular vote among Un-carrier customers\nXbox Music − \u2018All the Music You Love\u2019 on all your devices\nSoundCloud − Provides access to the world\u2019s largest community of music & audio creators\nRadioTunes − Features a wide variety of free streaming radio channels\nDigitally Imported −  The first service in Music Freedom devoted entirely to electronic dance music\nFit Radio − A wide selection of great workout songs for the gym\nFresca Radio − Delivers 40 channels of the best Latin, Hispanic and Caribbean music\nJAZZRADIO −  Enjoy endless hours of the best jazz music around\nLive365 − Thousands of internet radio stations featuring music in every style\nMad Genius Radio − For those who like a lot of music and who like their playlists fresh\nradioPup − Featuring 300+ local radio stations streaming the best music available\nradio.com − Original programming including streaming music and more\nROCKRADIO − 100% rock, streaming the most diverse variety of rock music online\nSaavn − All the best Bollywood and Indian music, online and on the go\n","Title":"T-Mobile adds Google Play Music, Xbox Music, SoundCloud, and others to Music Freedom | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","google","apps","mobile","tech"]}
