{"Main text":"Who\u2019s the new guy running the NSA?\nMeet career Navy man and self-identified geek liaison Michael S. Rogers\nActually, he didn\u2019t really downplay them \u2014 he just didn\u2019t up-play them as much as his predecessor, General Keith Alexander, who called the leaks \" the greatest damage to our combined nations\u2019 intelligence systems that we have ever suffered \" and is going around calling Snowden a Russian spy .\nBy contrast, the new guy is playing it cool. Rogers has been on the job for about three months, and he\u2019s been exceedingly diplomatic and measured. \"A broad dialogue about what we\u2019re doing and why is a good thing for our nation,\" he said at the  Bloomberg Government Cybersecurity Summit . \"I don\u2019t question that for one minute.\"\nThen-Vice Admiral Rogers addressing sailors at the Center for Information Dominance. ( US Navy \/ Wikipedia )\nIn addition to serving as the face of public relations for the Defense Department's \"silent service,\" Rogers has taken on two formal roles that come bundled with the NSA director position: head of the Central Security Service, another arm of the US\u2019 17-tentacled intelligence apparatus, and commander of US Cyber Command, the hub of the military\u2019s cyber efforts.\nThat means one man is in charge of the NSA\u2019s domestic and foreign surveillance, along with defending US government networks, coordinating cyberattacks against enemies, and supervising what is essentially the security IT department for the rest of the Defense Department.\nSo, who is he?\nAge: 54\u201355\nHometown: Born in the Chicago area; lives in Washington, DC.\nHobbies: Working 14-15 hour days , \"geek speak\" , stopping sailors from plugging their cellphones into the Secure Internet Protocol Router.\nProfile: Rogers graduated from New Trier East High School in Winnetka, Illinois, where he \"managed to avoid signiﬁcant notice or accomplishment\" but \"enjoyed participating in the performing arts and broadcasting\" while \"gaining a group of friends with whom he remains close to this day.\"\nRogers wanted to go to the US Naval Academy \u2014 he'd wanted to be a Navy officer  ever since he was young \u2014 but couldn\u2019t get in. He ended up in the Reserve Officers Training Corps program at Auburn University, where he was bad at math and dropped calculus. He became a Surface Warfare Officer after graduation, a rank for junior officers just out of college. His redesignation to cryptology a few years later started his career in intelligence.\nThe young officer worked his way up through the Navy\u2019s ranks, eventually serving as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and then head of the US Tenth Fleet and Fleet Cyber Command, the Navy\u2019s cyber-warfare force. There he fought off around \" 100 probes ,\" or cyberattacks, a day, including those from one Iranian hacker who twice prompted an organization-wide email shutdown and was \" driving the Navy ... nuts \" (he or she was never caught). Rogers liked to refer to his men in the Fleet as \" Jedi knights .\"\nRogers is a manager. He likes to build teams. \"I can lead,\" he told a class of high schoolers at his alma mater. \"I can bring groups together. I can motivate people.\"\nHe prides himself on being a liaison to the military\u2019s technologists. \"I\u2019m not a computer engineer,\" he says.\" I\u2019m not a computer scientist. I\u2019m not a mathematician. But I\u2019m comfortable with it.\"\nHe acknowledges being  groomed for the NSA position. When he was nominated, he reasoned that he owed it to the military to step up even though Snowden\u2019s revelations had put the agency in a \"tough spot.\" \"Now it\u2019s payback time,\" he told his wife, Dana, according to a military press release . \"What kind of leader, what kind of teammate would I be if I turned my back?\"\nThe new NSA chief has spent his first three months appearing at conferences , meeting with other agencies, and dialing back the government's rhetoric about Edward Snowden. (Rogers still believes the former NSA contractor is \"arrogant,\" however.) According to Rogers, Americans' expectation of privacy is being weakened because of  cellphones and online services , not because of domestic surveillance.\nQuote: \"If you are not excited by the opportunity that cyber represents to the Navy \u2026 then you do not have a pulse.\"\nRogers seems like a level-headed, analytical thinker not unlike President Barack Obama, who signed off on his nomination. It\u2019s too early to guess what he\u2019ll do, but so far he seems willing to at least pretend to engage the public about the NSA\u2019s activities and submit to new limits on its power . He also seems ready to compromise. But with the agency facing more scrutiny than ever, he'd have to be.\n","Title":"Who\u2019s the new guy running the NSA? | The Verge","Tags":["report","us-world","national-security"]}
