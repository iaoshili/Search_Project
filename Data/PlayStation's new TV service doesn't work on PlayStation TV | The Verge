{"Main text":"PlayStation's new TV service doesn't work on PlayStation TV\nOh, Sony\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony's odd-duck PlayStation TV hardware seemed like a good idea at the time \u2014 an inexpensive box that lets you play many of the excellent and inexpensive PS Vita games out there as well as a way to stream shows and movies. Unfortunately, the execution  left something to be desired on a number of fronts.  Plenty of the Vita's best games don't work with the hardware , and there's no great reason to use it as a set-top media box when compared with options from Amazon, Apple, Roku, and many others.\nThe  just-launched PlayStation Vue streaming TV service could have been the most compelling reason yet to buy a PlayStation TV \u2014 but Sony decided it didn't want potential customers to have a cheap box for potential new customers to use. Instead, PlayStation Vue is only available on the PS3 and PS4, which means the up-front hardware cost a good bit over $100.\nYou read that right: PlayStation Vue, Sony's new TV service, won't work on PlayStation TV.

But I couldn't help but laugh out loud and shake my head when I realized a device called the PlayStation TV doesn't work with Sony's new PlayStation TV service.\n","Title":"PlayStation's new TV service doesn't work on PlayStation TV | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","hd-home","tldr","entertainment","tech"]}
