{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAziz Ansari is teaming up with some of the producers of Parks & Recreation for a new sitcom at Netflix.  Deadline reports that the currently untitled show, which stars Ansari, has been given a 10-episode run. Eric Wareheim (the latter half of Tim & Eric), H. Jon Benjamin (who voices Archer), Lena Waithe (a Dear White People producer), Noël Wells (formerly of Saturday Night Live), and Kelvin Yu (who writes for Bob's Burgers) have also been cast. There's no formal description for the show just yet, but Deadline describes it as a semi-autobiographical comedy that \"deals with dating and relationships,\" which sounds like an elaborate way of describing almost every sitcom.\nAnsari has worked with Netflix in the past, with two standup specials currently exclusive to the service. This new show is being co-created with Alan Yang, a Parks & Rec executive producer. Both Ansari and Yang will serve as executive producers of the show, as will Parks & Rec co-creator Michael Schur and Parks & Rec executive producer David Miner. The show is said to have started filming in New York, but there's no word on when it's expected to be ready to air. Based on the people involved, it's probably something that comedy fans \u2014 or, at the very least, Parks & Rec fans \u2014 will want to look out for.\nVox Video: Netflix's Daredevil is the most recent example of fantastic original programming\n","Title":"Aziz Ansari is making a Netflix sitcom with Parks & Rec producers | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
