{"Main text":"Classic Macs turned into modern furniture\nKlaus Geiger makes Apple computers with a different kind of storage\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Apple Power Mac G5 was a classic computer of the early millennium, but for all of its strengths \u2014 besides its gorgeous design, it was the fastest Mac in Apple's lineup when it was released in 2003 \u2014 it didn't last: the G5 family was retired in 2006 for the Mac Pro. The rest is recent history .\nBut what to do with the old models? Designer Klaus Geiger had the idea of turning them into furniture, which resulted in the concepts you see here, part of the cleverly titled \"benchma[r|c\" project. Somehow, the pieces are all cohesive: Apple's commitment to flat, clean design translates well into a modernist style. If you passed one of these benches in a park, you might not blink.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
