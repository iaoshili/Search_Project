After being  announced last June , the game has seen  a few delays , but is finally  set to launch on PC on April 14th . And today is the first chance to see the latest version of the game in action. The new game is largely the same as the enhanced edition of GTA V that hit the Xbox One and PS4 last year, introducing  new features like a first-person mode . But PC gamers with the right hardware will get the prettiest version of the game yet, including support for 4K resolution and up to three monitors, so you can really immerse yourself in Los Santos. It's a big step up from  the original release of the game on Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2013, which went on to  earn more than $1 billion in just three days .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
