{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJ.K. Rowling has written  a new story about Harry Potter, featuring the character as an adult for the first time since the conclusion of her book series nearly seven years ago. The story is the latest in a series about the the Quidditch World Cup that Rowling has been writing  over at Pottermore for a few months now in anticipation of the actual World Cup. Written from the perspective of gossip journalist Rita Skeeter \u2014 a name that's also out of the Harry Potter books \u2014 the column runs across details on Harry at age 34, as well as his wife, his closest friends, and a few other of the series' recurring characters.\nHarry, Hermione, and Ron over a decade later\nThere's not necessarily a lot for fans to take away \u2014 these are mostly surface level observations and sketchy information from a gossip columnist, after all \u2014 but there are a few new details on what Harry, Hermione, and Ron have all been up to in the years since Rowling left them. That's certainly more than fans have been expecting, as Rowling has said in the past that she's done with Harry's story. Don't expect her to break the rule again anytime soon though: Rowling's spokesperson  tells The Bookseller that she has \"no plans\" to write additional Potter stories.\nThere will be more stories in the Harry Potter world, however. Rowling is  writing the screenplay for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , the first in a new movie series set in her \"wizarding world.\" The movie will take place 70 years before the events of the Harry Potter books, and it's currently  scheduled for release on November 18th, 2016 . There's no word on how many films will follow it or how closely Rowling will be involved after that, but it's easy to imagine that with the series' continued popularity that Rowling and Warner Bros. won't be quick to let it go.\nRowling has largely been staying away from Potter\nFor the most part though, Rowling has been trying to build the rest of her career around new stories. Most notably, she even  published a detective novel under a pseudonym in order to avoid publicity for it, allowing the novel to succeed or fail on its own. It's a bold decision, and it's one that we may well still not know about had her authorship not leaked out to the press.\nRowling's new Harry Potter story is available to read  at Pottermore , but the site is crawling right now and largely inaccessible (you can probably make an educated guess as to why). You'll also have to create an account at Pottermore and be logged in to read it. Fortunately, the full text of Rowling's story has been reprinted  over at Today , which seems to be the best place to start reading. The Bookseller reports that Rowling will publish a final Quidditch World Cup story on Friday.\n","Title":"J.K.
