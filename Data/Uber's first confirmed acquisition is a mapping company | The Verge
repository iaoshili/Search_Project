The company will become a subsidiary of Uber, continuing to offer products including local search and turn-by-turn navigation. Of the company's 40 employees, 30 will remain at Uber, including its CEO, Mashable reported.\nFrequent Uber riders know its Google Maps-based routing isn't always reliable; drivers often arrive a block or two away from where the rider has requested the ride. And Uber is investing more in mapping as it develops  UberPOOL , its multi-person ride hailing offering, which involves more complex routing. \"A lot of the functionality that makes the Uber app so reliable, affordable and seamless is based on mapping technologies,\" Uber told Mashable. \"With the acquisition of deCarta, we will continue to fine-tune our products and services that rely on maps \u2014 for example UberPOOL, the way we compute ETAs, and others \u2014 and make the Uber experience even better for our users.\"\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. DeCarta  had raised $56.1 million , according to CrunchBase.\nUpdate, 7:18PM: An Uber spokeswoman wrote in to say that Uber has acquired \"a very small number\" of other companies, but isn't naming them.\n","Title":"Uber's first confirmed acquisition is a mapping company | The Verge","Tags":["business","tech","transportation"]}
