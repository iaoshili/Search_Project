{"Main text":"HP\u2019s Surface Pro 3 replica debuts today\nAnother HP clone\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHP is launching its own version of the Surface Pro 3 today. No, it hasn\u2019t taken over manufacturing of Microsoft\u2019s tablet, it\u2019s merely imitating it. HP\u2019s new Envy x2 has a multi-angle kickstand, a fabric keyboard cover that clicks into place with a stylus holder loop, and it all adds up to something that looks eerily similar to Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 3 tablet. There\u2019s a 13.3-inch model and a 15-inch version, and both ship with Intel\u2019s latest Core M processors in a variety of configurations. Although the 13-inch model has a base display that\u2019s 1366 x 768 resolution, it can be upgraded to match the 1920 x 1080 resolution of the base 15-inch model.\nWhile the similarities are clear, HP\u2019s tablet hybrid is significantly heavier and thicker than Microsoft\u2019s tablet despite it using a fanless design and no visible venting. The 13-inch Envy x2 is 13.7mm thick compared to the 9.1mm Surface Pro 3, and it weighs 2.81 pounds without the keyboard, compared to the 1.76 pounds of the Surface Pro 3. HP is trying to match Microsoft on price, too, with the 13-inch model starting at $799 and the 15-inch version starting at $749.\nNext\nHP has made some subtle changes, and those include an SD slot at the side, Beats Audio speakers, and an interesting keyboard design. The keyboard folds away and the trackpad has been strangely positioned to the side of the keyboard on the 15-inch model. If there\u2019s one trick that Microsoft has missed and HP has capitalized on it\u2019s a Bluetooth-powered keyboard to let you use the keyboard when it\u2019s detached from the tablet. Microsoft has accessories for this, but it\u2019s good to have this built-in if you want to work further away from the screen. HP\u2019s offering of a 15-inch version will also appeal to the masses of consumers that  still buy a lot of 15-inch laptops . Oddly, the 15-inch model also has a traditional 500GB hard drive rather than the solid-state storage found on the 13-inch model.\nHP might not be a stranger to  mimicking competitor designs , but it\u2019s still unusual to see a close partner of Microsoft offer a product that\u2019s clearly inspired by the Surface Pro 3. Both HP Envy x2 models go on sale today.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
