{"Main text":"The AP confused an accused murderer with the lead singer of Limp Bizkit\nA lesson learned\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn a brief from last night, an AP reporter confused accused murderer Robert Durst with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst. Santa Monica-based NPR hostÂ  Eric Roy spotted the error as it came over the AP wire \u2014 apparently the mistake was limited to a California AP broadcast. This morning, the news service posted this correction:\nIn the second item of the California 10th NewsMinute sent March 16 to users of the state broadcast wire, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Robert Durst is a member of a band. He is a real estate heir; Fred Durst is the former frontman of Limp Bizkit.\nAs noted by Twitter user @psamp, another Bizkit member is vaguely connected to another of today's trending topics.\nRobert Durst and Chris Borland both trending at the same time is the closest we'll ever get to Limp Bizkit being back in style.\n\u2014 psamp (@psamp) March 17, 2015\nThe joke is in reference to Wes Borland, the guitarist you might remember wearing spooky all-black contacts. Borland has a pretty good sense of humor about the band, which tours to this day. He had an honest and illuminating interview with Stereogum earlier this year.\nIt's easy to mess with Limp Bizkit, but you can't mess with Limp Bizkit. (Yes, that's a play on actual Limp Bizkit lyrics (we were all 11 once)). But I admire the philosophy Borland brings to the band. After all, even being in Limp Bizkit is a job.\n\"Because now it's like, it is what it is,\" says Borland. \"I'm fine with it, I'm fine with the criticisms that come with it. I totally get it, and it also allows me to work in a band and tour, and I'm really lucky that I was in the last wave of bands to be able to have a large fan base and tour the world, and it allows me to do other stuff, too. So I have other projects that I'm working on outside of it. I get to play guitar in my girlfriend's band [Queen Kwong], and that's like the completely other end of the spectrum. I get to do a bunch of different kinds of music and be in Limp Bizkit and not have pressure like bands today who are struggling to rub two nickels together.\"\n","Title":"The AP confused an accused murderer with the lead singer of Limp Bizkit | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
