While such a landmark show returning in one form or another is almost expected at this point, the big news is that the entire team is on board: David Duchovny will be returning as Agent Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Agent Dana Scully, and creator and executive producer Chris Carter will be overseeing it all.\nThe X-Files originally ran for nine seasons and spawned two theatrical films; its network run ended in 2002. \"I think of it as a 13-year commercial break,\" Carter said in a statement. \"The good news is the world has only gotten that much stranger, a perfect time to tell these six stories.\"\nFollowing in the footsteps of '24: Live Another Day'\nAfter a long hiatus from the medium,  Carter has tried to work his way back into television over the last few years, with mixed results. He created a new show called The After for Amazon, and while the company ordered it to series the show was  subsequently cancelled . He's also been  working on a show about Area 51 for AMC, but that has yet to move forward either.\nFox previously brought back a beloved franchise under the \"limited series\" moniker \u2014 essentially a mini-season's worth of episodes \u2014 with 24: Live Another Day. That did quite well for the network , and as  Variety points out , it also renewed interest in previous seasons, leading to a lucrative new 24 streaming deal with Amazon. That is no doubt just one of several factors behind the return of The X-Files, but for fans only one thing matters: Mulder and Scully are back.\n","Title":"The X-Files is coming back to television | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
