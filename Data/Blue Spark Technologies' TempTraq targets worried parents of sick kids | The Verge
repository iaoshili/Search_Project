{"Main text":"Blue Spark Technologies' TempTraq targets worried parents of sick kids\nThe patch is placed in a child's armpit\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNervous parents are an easy sell. That may be why Blue Spark Technologies is expanding its temperature-reading devices into human thermometers. The TempTraq adhesive patch goes under a sick child's armpit and monitors temperature for a little over a day. It sends temperatures to a parent's smartphone, and allows for easy export of the data \u2014 if, for instance, parents want to send it to their child's doctor.\nRight now the FDA is reviewing Blue Spark's application for marketing approval.
