{"Main text":"Netflix orders sketch comedy series from Bob Odenkirk and David Cross\nThe Mr. Show duo is back\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix has  grabbed a new comedy series from two big names: Bob Odenkirk and David Cross, the duo behind the classic HBO sketch series Mr. Show. They're beginning production on a Netflix series, titled With Bob and David, that'll include four half-hour episodes and an hourlong making-of special. The episodes will have the duo doing sketch comedy, entirely using new characters (presumably, that's because this is a Mr. Show reunion in spirit, not in name and rights). Along with a number of others, the comedy duo of Tim & Eric are listed as executive producers. There's no word yet on when the series is expected to premiere.\nIn addition to With Bob and David, Netflix  also ordered today a supernatural drama called Montauk. It'll take place in the \u201980s and involve a boy's disappearance and secret government experiments \u2014 the actual story is being kept pretty vague for now. Eight hourlong episodes are expected to premiere next year.\nEight men out... of the 1990s. Maybe something new coming from the Mr. Show gang in the new year? #MrShow pic.twitter.com\/gBy8CQ49nv\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
