{"Main text":"Republicans and Democrats are fighting over who loves Uber more\nAfter big Democrat hired, Republican Chairman tweets support\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou may not recognize the name David Plouffe offhand, but as President Obama's former campaign manager, he was instrumental in winning control of the White House twice in the 2008 and 2012 elections, respectively. As of last week, Plouffe, a longtime Democratic Party operative, aligned himself with a very different powerhouse: Uber, the disruptive transportation company that's clashed with local governments and cab drivers over the past few years as its spread around the world and racked up a  reported $17 billion valuation . Uber hired Plouffe as its  senior vice president of policy and strategy , a clear sign the company is getting more serious about political battles in Washington and beyond.\nBut that's why it's funny that today, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republic National Committee (the organizing body of the Republican Party across the country), tweeted about his  continuing support for Uber . \"Even top Dems admit that ride-sharing can benefit all Americans,\"  Priebus wrote , including a link to a petition calling upon people to \"stand-up\" for \"free market principles\" and support Uber in its battle against \"taxi unions and liberal government bureaucrats.\"\nEven top Dems admit that ride-sharing can benefit all Americans. http:\/\/t.co\/VUAfT47pNZ Retweet & Support this bipartisan issue.\n\u2014 Reince Priebus (@Reince) August 25, 2014\nIndeed, Uber's CEO Travis Kalanick is an  outspoken libertarian and fan of objectivist author Ayn Rand, which would seem to place his views more comfortably in line with  some politicians in the Republican Party (which has lately been more hospitable to libertarians). Yet, as  The Hill notes, after Plouffe joined the company, Uber posted a  list of quotes from top Democrats praising the hire. Who loves Uber more now? It seems that politicians on both sides of the aisle can at least agree in their support for a convenient car service app, a heartening development for Uber, and perhaps less so for some of the  other pressing issues facing the country .\n","Title":"Republicans and Democrats are fighting over who loves Uber more | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
