{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGotham premieres tonight at 8pm ET on Fox. Here's our look at the first episode when it first screened at San Diego Comic-Con this summer.\nIn the opening moments of Fox\u2019s new series Gotham, you follow a young, strangely mute Selina Kyle as she leaps up and down fire escapes, picking pockets and making mischief. You guess she\u2019s supposed to be \"young Catwoman\" because of her signature goggles and her cat-like agility, but you never get a glimpse into her inner life.\nA few minutes later she comes across a particularly iconic murder scene. The Wayne family is on their way home after a night out, and have taken Selina\u2019s alley as a shortcut to a cab. A masked gunman appears. A gun fires. Pearls fall to the pavement. And Bruce Wayne is left with the cold bodies of his parents as the murderer vanishes into the night. The drama is palpable in this scene \u2014 the score swells, the camera pulls way back to expose the human wreckage \u2014 but, after Wayne the younger lets out a just-shy-of-bloodcurdling scream, you get the sense that you\u2019ve seen all of this before.\nThat\u2019s the problem with Gotham right from the beginning. As concerned as it is to show you characters and set pieces you might recognize, it never really takes the time to enrich them. It\u2019s hard to really judge a pilot since so much is just set-up, but for Gotham to work, it needs to give you a reason to care about these characters \u2014 many of them future heroes and villains we already know \u2014 beyond what\u2019s familiar on the surface.\nGotham takes place in Gotham City, a place we\u2019ve been trained to believe is as dirty and dangerous as crack-era New York \u2014 and this is all before Batman comes to save the city from itself. Most of the action follows Jim Gordon, played by Ben McKenzie, here a young detective trying to clean up Gotham\u2019s streets amidst corruption and crime. His partner, Harvey Bullock \u2014 played by Sons of Anarchy\u2019s Donal Logue \u2014 is the boozing bad cop to his good cop and has no problem making deals with the criminal element to make a case. The pair are thrown headlong into solving the Wayne murders, and their investigation takes them on a tour of Gotham players, either mainstays from the comics or riffs on noir archetypes, twisted just enough to hint at something fresh but never enough to draw us in.\nTake Fish Mooney, for instance. Played by Jada Pinkett Smith, Mooney\u2019s a take on that classic, grasping crime boss-slash-nightclub owner who has her hand in both legal and illegal activities. You can tell Smith\u2019s having a great deal of fun in the role, blending street smarts with urbane class and chewing scenery while she does it, but she\u2019s so completely campy that you never feel the air of sinister power she\u2019s meant to exude. Her lackey is Oswald Cobblepot, played by Robin Lord Taylor, who\u2019s a serviceable proto-Penguin but never hits the high notes you want him to. In Gotham, you\u2019re always left wanting more.\nIn 'Gotham', you're always left wanting more\nThe rest of the recognizable characters \u2014 Renee Montoya, Alfred, Carmine Falcone, and others \u2014 are all a series of near misses, but none are more disappointing than Jim Gordon himself. Ben McKenzie\u2019s take is just so flat that, by episode\u2019s end, the only thing notable about him is the fact that we know he\u2019ll be Commissioner one day.   He is, however, elevated by a star turn by Donal Logue. Funny, conflicted, and a little dangerous, Harvey Bullock is the kind of dirty cop you want to learn about and root for. As yet another character lifted from the comics, he\u2019s a bit more than what we\u2019ve been trained to expect, even playing something of a mentor to the young Gordon. Frankly, DC Entertainment should just hand the show to him.\nThe biggest disappointment, though, is how the city itself is characterized. Gotham owes much to cop procedurals like Law and Order and the work of Frank Miller, but it wants more than anything to be noir. And as stylish and gritty as it is, this city never breathes. There\u2019s so much noise and so little atmosphere that you just feel like you\u2019re watching the action in a series of rooms and not in a city with its own iconic identity. Everything feels so rushed. And that's a shame, because the best Batman stories are the ones where you can the feel the fabric of Gotham itself, rough edges and all, rather than just look at the grime on the surface.\nThe best Batman stories are the ones where you can feel the fabric of Gotham itself\nGotham got a full series order after it was announced, so the series will have plenty of time to develop its characters after it premieres on September 22nd. But for the show to truly find its way, it needs to do more than just take what we know and put a new spin on things. It has a chance, since there\u2019s some good here worth expanding while the bad can be improved over time. But for this show to really work, Gotham City needs to feel alive.\n","Title":"'Gotham' first look: all set-up and no substance | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","sdcc-2014","tv-reviews\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5695384"]}
