{"Main text":"Spend a few minutes as a robotic museum tourist\nThe Tate Britain is letting people pilot robots for an after-hours tour\nLast night, I heard one of those sentences you're sure you'll never hear again: \"Robot two is moving through the Tudor galleries.\"\n\"Robot two is moving through the Tudor galleries.\"\nThe Tate Britain, a London art museum, is mid-way through an audacious experiment, letting tourists across the world pilot robots around the museum during off-hours. To participate in the project, called After Dark, you visitÂ  the project's website during dedicated hours, and tune in as four telepresence robots scurry around the floor, taking in the culture. If you type in your name, the robots may choose you to participate. You'll end up deciding what to examine as a cheery duo of curators informs the audience what the robots are looking at.\nThe result's disorienting at times, as you swirl between four viewpoints, simultaneously observing modern sculptures and classic 18th-century paintings, but it's also worthwhile: you're guaranteed to learn something with four cameras rolling through. Even if you're not into art, the weirdness of the project itself is enjoyable enough. At one point, two of the robots in the dark museum stopped looking at paintings and started looking at each other. That may have been the most artistic moment of the tour.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
