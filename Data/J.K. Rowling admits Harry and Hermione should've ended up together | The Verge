{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHarry Potter author J.K. Rowling has admitted she may have made a mistake by marrying off Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley in the final book of the series. The comments came in an interview conducted by Emma Watson during her tenure as guest editor for the upcoming issue of the British quarterly Wonderland . Watson played Hermione in the massively successful film adaptions of the best-selling series.\n\"I wrote the Hermione \/ Ron relationship as a form of wish fulfillment,\" says Rowling, explaining that when she first conceived that characters she imagined they would be together by the end of the series. However, as more novels were written and the relationships between the series' lead characters became ever more complex, Rowling admits that the ending had \"very little to do with literature\" and \"far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it.\"\n\"Harry and Hermione were a better match than Ron and Hermione.\"\nThe full interview will be published February 7th, but excerpts were printed in a separate interview with Emma Watson in The Sunday Times , which notes in its write-up that Watson and Rowling \"agree that Harry and Hermione were a better match than Ron and Hermione.\" When not ruing the relationship choices she made on behalf of her beloved characters, Rowling is currently writing a screenplay for a Harry Potter spinoff centered on Newt Scamander, the fictional author of a book featured in the series, and is also developing a stage play that explores Potter's early years.\n","Title":"J.K.
