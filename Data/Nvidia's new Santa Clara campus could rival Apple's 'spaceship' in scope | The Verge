{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang today announced that his company has begun work on a new campus. The building, designed by renowned architecture firm Gensler, will be located \"directly across the street\" from Nvidia's current headquarters in Santa Clara, California. \"The new NVIDIA building will capture the ambition and imagination of our people,\" says Huang. \"It will be the symbol, the physical manifestation, of our vision for the company.\" The news comes as Nvidia celebrates another milestone; it was founded 20 years ago this month.\nThe new campus is centered around a massive building separated into two triangular sections. The shape is an appropriate match for Nvidia, with Juang describing the triangle as \"the fundamental building block of computer graphics.\" \"Efficient in every way, the design is thoughtful in its use of space, energy, and environment, and, of course, cost,\" he says. Unfortunately he doesn't reveal exactly how much the ambitious build will cost, nor does Huang provide an estimate as to when the new campus will be complete.\nOther Silicon Valley mainstays have also revealed ambitious design plans in recent years. Apple hopes to complete a new campus by 2015 . The building, commonly referred to as the \"spaceship\" thanks to its odd design, will supplement Apple's existing presence in Cupertino, California. Facebook has also detailed plans to expand its Menlo Park HQ with a building designed by Frank Gehry. Meanwhile, expansion is the last thing on the mind of longtime Nvidia competitor AMD. The troubled chipmaker announced last year that it hopes to sell its Austin, Texas campus as a means of raising cash.\n","Title":"Nvidia's new Santa Clara campus could rival Apple's 'spaceship' in scope | The Verge","Tags":["design","architecture"]}
