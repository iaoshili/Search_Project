{"Main text":"SpaceX postpones its reusable Falcon 9 launch again\nThe launch has been rescheduled for tomorrow evening\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSpaceX's latest Falcon 9 launch was postponed once again, this time due to extreme upper-level winds. The launch has been rescheduled for tomorrow at 6:03PM ET. This was the third time the company had to postpone the launch, which was originally scheduled for Sunday.\nThe high winds were seen throughout the day both on the ground and at 25,000 feet. Elon Musk foreshadowed the postponement earlier in the afternoon:\nExtreme wind shear over Cape Canaveral. Feels like a sledgehammer when supersonic in the vertical. Hoping it changes \u2026\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 10, 2015\nEven with the scrubbed launch this was still a busy day for SpaceX. One of its Dragon cargo capsules separated from the International Space Station earlier this afternoon, and is ticketed to splash down off the coast of California later this evening.\nThis mission is SpaceX's second attempt at testing the company's reusable Falcon 9 rocket. During the first attempt in January, the rocket made it to the barge but ran out of hydraulic fluid. As a result, it landed too hard and exploded on impact .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
