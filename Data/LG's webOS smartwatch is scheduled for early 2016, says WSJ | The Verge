{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLG's smartwatch plans may be only a year away, according to a new report from The Wall Street Journal . The report says LG's much-rumored webOS smartwatch is set for release in early 2016, citing \"a person familiar with the plans.\" According to the source, \"We\u2019re going to slowly try to build an (software) ecosystem around areas we can have more control over,\" setting the watch in contrast to the company's Android watch offerings. If true, it's an encouraging sign for a project that many thought might never see a final release. As the company told The Verge in October, \"there are many initiatives going on at LG at any given moment. The majority of them never see the light of day.\"\nLG already makes two smartwatches, the G Watch and G Watch R, both of which run Android, and the companyÂ  teased a third model at CES, made in partnership with Audi. Still, the prospect of a watch built on Palm's dearly loved webOS platform has many users and developers excited. LG owns the rights to the platform and has already used it in a line of smart TVs . A developer website published in October seemed to show the device as a classic analog watch, but otherwise it's unclear what new features it might have.\n","Title":"LG's webOS smartwatch is scheduled for early 2016, says WSJ | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
