{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis is  what happens when cartoonist Matthew Inman gets to ride in Google's self-driving car:\nInman, the cartoonist behind The Oatmeal, got to take a test ride in one of Google's autonomous cars last week, and naturally, he's  put his impressions online with some illustrations to go along with them. Though the cartoons depict  the new prototype car that Google unveiled today , it looks like Inman  may have only got to try out one of the existing consumer vehicles that Google has modified to drive on its own. Even so, Inman comes away impressed with the car, writing that Google's vehicle \"drives like a person, and after a few minutes you forget that you\u2019re being driven autonomously.\"\nInman says the cars \"are throttled to act like nervous student drivers.\"\nThe biggest difference between riding in Google's car and with an experienced driver may be that, for now, Google has set its car up to operate with extreme caution. \"Google can adjust the level of aggression in the software, and the self-driving prototypes currently tooling around Mountain View are throttled to act like nervous student drivers,\" Inman writes. Apparently, a more aggressive driving style is being tested on Google's private tracks and has led to some scared observers.\nAs for why Google would invite a cartoonist for a test drive, perhaps it's a matter of helping it to win over the public. The idea of having driverless cars on the road is scary for many, and it's going to take a lot of public support to get regulations in place to make that happen widely. The Oatmeal has an audience that's  willing to stand behind ideas they like \u2014 and Inman's support could just help win Google some fans.
