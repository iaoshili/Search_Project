{"Main text":"Inside the studio where ESPN is betting billions on the future of sports\nBy David Pierce\n\"Oh my goodness,\" NBC football analyst Cris Collinsworth shouts into his headset mic over the roar of the MetLife Stadium crowd. \"This is sick. Put this to music. I don't think he stepped out, either. That may be the greatest catch I've ever seen. You have to be kidding me. That is impossible. That is absolutely impossible what he just did.\"\nIt\u2019s Sunday night on the weekend before Thanksgiving, and Odell Beckham Jr. has just given his New York Giants a big lead on their arch-rival Dallas Cowboys in the beginning of the second quarter. He lies on the turf, briefly savoring the 43-yard touchdown pass he\u2019s just caught. It was an unbelievable, once-in-a-career catch. He\u2019d leapt backwards, stretching the length of his body and snaring the football with two fingers and his thumb. Despite an illegal hit by Cowboys defensive back Brandon Carr, he\u2019d held on: 14-3, Giants. Beckham\u2019s team will ultimately lose , but it\u2019s the catch that everyone will remember.\nBeckham gets up, tosses the ball into the air, and struts through the end zone with his arms outstretched as the 80,520 fans in attendance roar in appreciation. In an otherwise unremarkable game, Beckham has made an utterly remarkable play \u2014 a play that will be seen around the world.\nPhotos of the catch flood Twitter instantly. Most depict paused TVs showing the replay, the TiVo interface visible everywhere. A minute or two later, a Vine appears in everyone\u2019s timeline: six seconds of the catch, recorded by a user named Chipper with a dog for an account photo. To date, the Vine has been viewed nearly 7 million times.\nWhile Beckham is still celebrating, the @ESPNNFL account tweets \"HOLY COW ODELL BECKHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (That\u2019s 14 exclamation points.) But it takes a full 15 minutes before ESPN shares a picture on its SportsCenter Twitter account, with the caption \"Catch. Of. The. Year. #sctop10.\" The account\u2019s 13.5 million followers go rabid: the tweet is shared and fav\u2019d upwards of 50,000 times. Such is ESPN\u2019s power that it can show up late to the party and still dominate the scene.\nUnder president John Skipper and the Disney umbrella, ESPN has spent the last decade amassing an untouchably large amount of live sports programming. The network\u2019s empire extends from football and basketball; to auto sports and the X-Games; to ultimate frisbee, poker, and bowling. It broadcasts the World Cup and the Masters, Monday Night Football and the NBA Playoffs. By any measure \u2013 it\u2019s the most popular cable channel by a mile; it commands a per-subscriber fee from cable companies equal to the next five most expensive combined; it\u2019s valued at more than $50 billion , 13 times as much as Disney-owned ABC \u2014 ESPN is the country\u2019s most powerful media company. The calculus is as simple as it is devastatingly effective: sports is practically the only TV that millions of people still insist on watching live, and ESPN owns almost all the sports.\nESPN's selection of live programming is utterly unequaled\nBut it may not stay that way for long. When ESPN launched in 1979, the company competed for attention with TV, radio, and newspapers. But in 2015 sports fans have online fantasy teams and prop bets; they\u2019re on Twitter, Vine, Snapchat, and Facebook; they\u2019re watching games on their phones, their tablets, and their laptops. They want to read about sports, talk about sports, and watch sports while they watch other sports. If ESPN doesn\u2019t provide those services, someone else will.\nESPN\u2019s long-stated mission is to meet sports fans wherever they are. And so the company is embarking on a sweeping mission to expand its dominion beyond cable TV to whatever comes next \u2014 even if it\u2019s not sure what that will be.\nIn short: ESPN\u2019s not okay with Chipper winning the Vine battle anymore.\nHannah Storm and Kevin Negandhi at the SportsCenter desk (Photo by Joe Faraoni \/ ESPN Images)\nSportsCenter is the most important property at ESPN. It's live 18 hours each day, beginning with the 9AM show. It was the first show to air when ESPN switched on its satellites on September 7th, 1979 \u2013 the second was a slow-pitch softball game \u2014 and has been the network\u2019s flagship brand ever since.\nDuring that first broadcast, Lee Leonard, sitting in front of an impressionistic montage of sports figures, told viewers ESPN would be where viewers could come find \"where all the sports action is, as of right now.\" As the camera zoomed in on Leonard\u2019s enormous glasses and beige suit (which matched the wall a little too well), he introduced SportsCenter: \"Now here\u2019s another innovation on ESPN, and it\u2019s going to be a big part of our future: the SportsCenter with George Grande. He\u2019ll have the latest on what\u2019s happening all around.\" And indeed, for over three decades and more than 50,000 episodes, SportsCenter was the place you went for dispatches from every corner of the sports world. There was no Twitter, no Vine, no YouTube; for sports fans, there was only SportsCenter.\nThe very first SportsCenter, in 1979\nIn 2015, SportsCenter is different. It\u2019s glossier, more personal \u2014 a Good Morning America for sports fans. It\u2019s still a water cooler of sorts, designed to fill you in on things you missed and tell you everything you need to know about them. But now its vaunted \"Top 10\" segment shows more niche sports, more viral videos; its anchors spend more time on news and analysis and far less on showing the games themselves. Like every other show on the network, it\u2019s been forced to adapt to a new audience: the relentless consumer, the one who\u2019s already seen the plays of the day and tunes into SportsCenter to see what they missed and, just as importantly, how they\u2019re supposed to feel about it.\nWhen everyone gets the news from Twitter, SportsCenter has to be something different\nThe morning after Beckham\u2019s catch, I\u2019m standing just off-camera in the SportsCenter studio, in sleepy Bristol, Connecticut. You can hardly make a left turn in Bristol, a town of 60,000, without ending up on ESPN\u2019s sprawling campus. Outside, it\u2019s a dark and dreary Monday. But SportsCenter\u2019s updated set, which debuted in June and looks a bit like the bridge of Star Trek\u2019s Enterprise \u2014 only bigger and with more buttons \u2014 is buzzing.\nWhile an army of producers and camera operators gathers around a desk in the center of the room, co-anchor Kevin Negandhi paces the catwalk (yes, there\u2019s a catwalk, about 18 inches off the ground), perfecting his blocking with a cameraman. Behind him, an enormous screen displays a photo of Odell Beckham Jr., his outstretched right hand completing last night\u2019s catch. Negandhi, who\u2019s anchored the show since 2011, checks his tie clip in the camera\u2019s reflection and asks if he\u2019s in the right spot. To his right are dozens of screens; to his left, more screens, 114 in all. Over the next hour, the screens will work individually and in tandem as they\u2019re moved constantly around the set, broadcasting tweets and videos as Negandhi and co-anchor Hannah Storm show athletes responding to Beckham\u2019s catch, talk about its place in NFL history, and later dissect breaking baseball news.\nAfter SportsCenter wrapped for the morning, I sat down with Negandhi and Storm on comfortable orange chairs inside the stunning new Digital Center 2, where the show is taped. DC-2, as it\u2019s widely known, is the 18th building on ESPN\u2019s campus. It\u2019s an immaculate, slightly sterile new production facility that was under construction for more than three years before opening its doors last summer. It is 194,000 square feet of technological progress, from the studios and the suite of editing rooms to the energy-efficient server rooms and the \"social media lounge\" upstairs. Every corner of DC-2 is a reminder of the intersection of sports and technology: the lobby is outfitted with large vertical screens, one showing every single \"This is SportsCenter\" ad ever made. Walk further and you\u2019ll see a gigantic ticker on the wall scrolling  news and scores. As you walk up the stairs to the studio, there\u2019s a wired CableCam floating above you, ominously watching.\nThe new SportsCenter set is the crown jewel of the building: 9,700 square feet of space that will be used to broadcast the show on ESPN\u2019s mass of channels. The revamped set was designed to make SportsCenter more personal, to show anchors moving around and interacting, but also to help the show move at the speed of the internet. ESPN has long been criticized for allowing news to break overnight while it ran repeats of the previous day\u2019s shows; now the premier show in sports can update and broadcast in real time.\nTV still matters at ESPN, and in every way DC-2 is wired for the future of TV. It\u2019s capable of broadcasting in 4K and 8K, and if by some miracle 3D actually takes off, ESPN will be ready for that, too. TV is still where the network makes most of its money, and it will be for the foreseeable future. But when \u2013 not if, but when \u2014 that changes, ESPN says it will be ready. It has moved staff, built buildings, and overhauled how the company operates to make sure of that.\nBuilding #13, Transmission, and the satellite farm (Photo by Joe Faraoni \/ ESPN Images)\nThe strategy to keep ESPN on top breaks down along two broad lines. The first is an adjustment in how ESPN sees itself: the company has reorganized to promote more sharing across platforms, even launching the buzzword-friendly Content Sharing Initiative. ESPN the TV network, ESPN the radio provider, ESPN the magazine, ESPN the Instagram account, and ESPN the app maker are all becoming one.\nThat\u2019s Rob King\u2019s project. King is the senior vice president of news and SportsCenter, which means he oversees everything from the flagship show to its apps and Twitter handles. In his previous role, he oversaw a merging of ESPN\u2019s digital and print operations into a single publication. He\u2019s also combined the company\u2019s many disparate breaking news and highlights teams into cross-company groups, which funnel information and assets to every ESPN outpost on any platform.\n\"Whatever platform [fans] are using,\" he says, \"whatever time of day it is, however they\u2019re connecting with their friends, we need to be there because that\u2019s holding up our end of the relationship.\"\nESPN SportsZone, circa 1996\nHolding up its end has meant a complete overhaul and upgrade of ESPN\u2019s technology to make it faster, more efficient, and more capable than before. ESPN has a track record of success when it comes to capitalizing on new technology: ESPNet SportsZone, a primitive website, built a huge early-internet audience in 1995; in 2011, WatchESPN let you watch live cable TV on a mobile device for the first time in history. The company has even won accolades for seemingly simple TV innovations, like putting a yellow line on the screen to indicate the first-down line or a square around the plate for the strike zone. In sports TV, most of what\u2019s now ubiquitous began with ESPN.\nThis time, the biggest change is one viewers don\u2019t see: the 1,110 miles of fiber-optic cable wired throughout DC-2. Fiber replaces the copper wire used elsewhere throughout ESPN and has fundamentally changed the speed at which the network can operate. A single fiber cable can carry 15-20 times as many signals more than 200 times farther than copper; that upgrade makes it possible for ESPN to have more footage at its disposal at all times.\nYears ago, Joe Sack remembers, it was all done on videotape. \"You can only do one thing at one time with one tape. Right? So if you want to do two things live, you\u2019ve got to record it twice. If you want to do three things, you\u2019ve got to record it three times.\" That led to confusion and clutter and slowed every process down. Copper cabling sped up the process, but even that only moved one signal at a time. During that era, ESPN had to build huge, impossibly complicated facilities that couldn\u2019t grow or adapt to new uses.\nToday ESPN is struggling to keep up with the speed of mobile and social audiences. And speed is everything.\nJoe Sack at the DC-2 \"fiber-cutting ceremony (Photo by Rich Arden \/ ESPN Images)\"\n\"If you are slow,\" says Anthony Mormile, ESPN\u2019s VP of digital video, \"and want to make it beautiful, you can\u2019t live in the Twitter space. Because some guy just held his phone up to his TV and put it up on Twitter, or some guy just GIF\u2019d it, or some guy made a Vine and got the whole play up, and here we come eight minutes after it happened with a \u2018ta-da! look at this beautiful opening. And we\u2019ve got music and natural sound!\u2019 And you\u2019re like \u2018we already saw it, dude.\u2019\"\nESPN\u2019s brand has long gone beyond TV, but the shift is accelerating. \"There are still a number of people on this campus who are shocked when you give them an all-in report,\" he says. \"They say \u2018whoa, more people watched my video on Twitter than ever saw it on SportsCenter?\u2019 And you\u2019re like, that\u2019s the power of social.\" To do its job properly now, ESPN needs to optimize sports for every platform at once \u2013 and the list keeps growing. \"We [even] have gas station TV now,\" says Mormile, \"so when you\u2019re filling up at the pump you have ESPN content. And the platforms keep changing, whether it\u2019s Apple TV or Roku or you\u2019re trying to make it prepared for Snapchat or Instagram.\"\nRob King, SVP of SportsCenter and News (Photo by Rich Arden \/ ESPN Images)\n\"If you're slow, and want to make it beautiful, you can't live in the Twitter space\"\nThat development is on display at Building 13 of the Bristol campus, known to employees as Transmission. As many as 110 streams can be captured at once here, either via the satellites or through the fiber network, and all are stored on a set of servers. Even as footage is recording, it\u2019s available to be immediately cut and clipped. That means ESPN is now able to take a single stream of a game, and in real time make it available absolutely everywhere \u2014 for ESPN\u2019s producers and for fans around the world.\nWhen something huge happens \u2014 Odell Beckham makes an earth-shattering catch, Usain Bolt breaks another world record, a minor league hockey fight breaks out while the players are all wearing Batman costumes \u2014 the SportsCenter team can cut highlights while the mobile team grabs the play that matters and sends it to your phone with a push alert. Meanwhile, the ESPN.com crew can put together a clip of the five best catches of all time, while the social media team is making GIFs. This is ESPN at its best and most internet-native: everything in its right place, and everything in real time.\nESPN can capture a game, and make it available everywhere in real time\nMuch of ESPN\u2019s historical success is rooted in the fact that covering sports is predictable business. \"In most organizations,\" says Rob King, \"you can\u2019t plan for big events other than elections and hurricane season. But in our world, you can say, this will be a big game.\"\nThat means much of ESPN\u2019s planning is done weeks and months in advance. On this Monday morning, the digital team is already sussing out angles for this weekend\u2019s Packers-Patriots game, and they\u2019re thinking about ranking all 636 players who will make the playoffs two months from now.\nAn employee works in the ESPN Transmission department (Photo by Joe Faraoni \/ ESPN Images)\nBut in the age of Twitter, viewers are hungry for off-the-cuff, unexpected viral moments that no one plans for. \"The best part,\" King says, \"and the most fun, is when Odell Beckham does something you\u2019ve never seen before. And that\u2019s when it\u2019s like alright, where is everybody? And what is this like? And how does this show up in the social space? And how can we compare it to other catches? And, you know, we\u2019ve got the ESPYs coming up in July, how do we make sure that that\u2019s going to be a play of the year nominee?\" This is the tension, King says: the best time to be a sports fan is when the crazy things happen. But that\u2019s when it\u2019s also hardest to be a sports network.\n\"Welcome to my nightmare,\" says Mormile when I bring up Beckham\u2019s catch. Moments after Beckham landed on his back, Mormile\u2019s team sprung to action. \"So now everybody goes \u2018I didn\u2019t see the catch! I heard there was a sick catch last night.\u2019 So I turn around and I say, how do I get that catch to mobile fans?\"\n\u2014 SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) November 24, 2014\nIt\u2019s a race, one ESPN is investing heavily in winning. \"The fans,\" Mormile tells me, \"just want to see the play. They don\u2019t care that you ripped it off the TV with your cellphone. So for us, we made a concerted effort to be even faster, and because ESPN technology is just amazing at what they do, we now have essentially real-time plays. And the real-time plays have all but eliminated the piracy. So we get a play up, maybe it\u2019s on a social platform 15 to 30 seconds after it happens, and there\u2019s no need for anybody to [copy].\"\nThere was only one problem in the Beckham example, Mormile tells me with a smirk: \"No video on mobile.\" ESPN doesn\u2019t own the rights to NFL highlights on mobile platforms (for now), so they have to develop workarounds. \"We get real creative with a still shot, and analysis of \u2018is it the greatest catch of all time?\u2019\" Even without video, the tweet went viral.\nThe Sanyo MVP\nOn Mormile\u2019s desk sits a Sanyo MVP, the black, ESPN-branded flip phone released in 2006. It represented the beginning of a company-wide effort to bring sports content to cellphones. This was two years before the iPhone and Android, and there was no useful way to get sports news and scores to the growing mobile market. So ESPN announced it was becoming a cellphone provider and would be making devices for sports fans. The MVP shipped with a simple Java app that delivered real-time scores (often ahead of the TV broadcast) and text message alerts whenever your team scored.\nMobile ESPN, as it was originally called, failed . Spectacularly. The phone was big, slow, and expensive, and it was useless for anything but getting sports news. Steve Jobs famously called Mobile ESPN \" the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard .\" Seven months after launch, ESPN shuttered the project at a loss of $150 million.\nBut the MVP is surely part of why ESPN\u2019s mobile offering was more popular than its desktop website as long ago as 2006. It\u2019s also why ESPN is a launch partner for Snapchat Discovery, the company\u2019s first tentative foray into professional content. The whole ethos here is to throw things at the wall and see what sticks. For all its faults, Mobile ESPN helped the company see what works (and what doesn\u2019t) on phones. It may have been clunky, but it gave the company a huge head start on mobile that\u2019s still paying dividends now.\nThe set of Monday Night Countdown (Photo by Joe Faraoni \/ ESPN Images)\nLong-term, ESPN\u2019s future will have to exist somewhere in the massively distributed content landscape. But for now, it\u2019s still mostly a TV network.\nAnd inside DC-2, a floor below the SportsCenter studio, there\u2019s another show to plan for. The Monday Night Countdown stars sit around a table with the show\u2019s producers, debating the merit of Beckham\u2019s catch. Keyshawn Johnson and Cris Carter, two Hall of Fame-caliber wide receivers turned Monday Night Countdown analysts, practice for the show: Carter talks about \"clearing your shoulders\" to make a catch, twisting his body to demonstrate. New gloves, he says, make difficult catches easier than they once were. Johnson says he made a catch similar to Beckham\u2019s when played for the Jets, but decides not to mention it on-air when he laughingly remembers the pass wasn\u2019t actually intended for him at all.\nThey work on transitions and monologues, making sure their analysis is interesting and distinct. Then each makes his pick for the evening\u2019s two games and talks about who\u2019s going to win the AFC West. (Four analysts, four strongly worded and radically different opinions.) The group breaks, off to prepare and change before the show starts at 6PM. Keyshawn Johnson bounds up the stairs to the studio two at a time, and Cris Carter ties his scarf back on, whistling \"Oh Christmas Tree\" to himself. Mike Ditka, who is referred to exclusively as \"Coach,\" ambles off without a word. Tom Jackson stays to chat with producers about the rundown.\nBy the time the games start on Monday evening, almost everyone on the ESPN campus will have gone home. Covering the game is the easy part, they all tell me. It\u2019s what ESPN has done for decades, and does better than anyone. ESPN\u2019s concern is making great television. And, increasingly, with making great Snapchat, and great Instagram, and great Twitter, and great Xbox.\nThe mission statement: \"To serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about or played\"\nIt all comes back to the company motto, which I first saw in giant letters hanging outside the building, facing the parking lot: \"To serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about or played.\"All over ESPN, people recite the motto to me and to each other, and they consider the question it poses: how do you do that in 2015, when the number of channels starts to lurch toward infinity? ESPN has a lot of answers, and a lot of technology to throw at those answers, but the questions come up more and more frequently.\nIt\u2019s been a long Monday, and a chaotic one, but it feels like everyone at ESPN is hoping something crazy happens tonight: that someone makes another internet-shaking catch, or breaks a record, or says something so outrageous that sports fans across the planet snap to attention and look to ESPN for coverage. And as I stand in Transmission, where hundreds of screens capture hundreds of games and prepare them for immediate broadcast to every platform you use and a half-dozen you don\u2019t, I get the sense ESPN loves the opportunity to prove what it can do.\nAnthony Mormile certainly does. As we talk in the afternoon, he runs through the day: two high-profile baseball players traded to the same team, two important football games, and that Odell Beckham catch. He riles himself up just talking about it. \"This is an amazing sports day.\" Then he pauses.\n\"Actually, Mondays are already pretty fun days for us.\"\nNote: piece has been updated to more accurately reflect Rob King's role, and that the Cowboys and Giants played at MetLife Stadium, not in Dallas.\nVideo by Jimmy Shelton and Jordan Oplinger, audio mixing by John Lagomarsino\nDesign by Dylan Lathrop\n","Title":"Inside the studio where ESPN is betting billions on the future of sports | The Verge","Tags":["culture","features","front-page","entertainment","longform\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"thephinsider"]}
