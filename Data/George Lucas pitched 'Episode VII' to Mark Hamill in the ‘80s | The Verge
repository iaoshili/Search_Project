{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt doesn't take a leap of the imagination to envision Mark Hamill playing an old Jedi mentor like Obi-Wan in the upcoming Episode VII. We know  he certainly has the beard to play the part , and according to a vintage interview that surfaced this week, it looks like George Lucas had just the same idea over 30 years ago.\n\"As much as I'd like to have a job lined up at the turn of the century...\"\nIn the 1983 interview, Hamill reveals that Lucas once asked him, \"Would you consider playing an Obi-Wan-like character, handing Excalibur down to the next generation?\" The sequel wouldn't be made until roughly 2011, Lucas said, and in return Hamill replied, \"Gee, as much as I'd like to have a job lined up at the turn of the century ... well, I don't know.\"\nNow, all of these years later, we're on the precipice of another Star Wars, but Hamill never could have imagined that George Lucas himself wouldn't be at the helm of the sequel. Of course, we don't know for certain what type of role Hamill will play in the upcoming film, but we do know that the script is based on some of Lucas' ideas for a sequel trilogy.\n","Title":"George Lucas pitched 'Episode VII' to Mark Hamill in the \u201880s | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
