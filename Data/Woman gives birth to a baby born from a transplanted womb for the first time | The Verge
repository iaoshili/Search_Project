{"Main text":"Woman gives birth to a baby born from a transplanted womb for the first time\nThe donor was a 61-year-old woman who had already given birth to two kids\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA women in Sweden gave birth to a baby boy last month, and it was nothing short of historic: the baby is the first child to be born from a transplanted womb. His mother, a 36-year-old woman, received a uterus from a family friend last year, the Associated Press reports. And although her baby was born prematurely by C-Section, both mother and child are well.\nIt\u2019s \"still sinking in that we have actually done it,\" Mats Brannstrom, an obstetrician at the University of Gothenberg, told the AP.\nThe donor had gone through menopause already\nThe news is a big deal for science and women in general, but it\u2019s especially important for people living in Sweden, where surrogacy isn\u2019t legal, reports The Washington Post . The mother was born without a uterus (but with functioning ovaries), which means that she would have been unable to have kids of her own without the surgery. Still, even after the transplant, Brannstrom was unsure whether a pregnancy would be possible. The donor was 61-year-old woman who had given birth to two kids. She had also gone through menopause.\nThe transplant's aftermath wasn't easy. The mother came close to rejecting the organ three times, including once during the pregnancy. Fortunately, her doctors were able to use drugs to prevent her body from rejecting the organ.\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether the mother will be able to carry a second child to term, Brannstrom said. But the parents really aren\u2019t thinking about that just yet.  \"Right now,\" the father said, \"we're very happy with just one baby.\"\n","Title":"Woman gives birth to a baby born from a transplanted womb for the first time | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world"]}
