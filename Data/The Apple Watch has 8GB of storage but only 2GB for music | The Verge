{"Main text":"The Apple Watch has 8GB of storage but only 2GB for music\nOnly 75MB of storage for photos\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDon't expect to store a ton of music on your Apple Watch. According to  9to5Mac , it has confirmed with Apple that the Apple Watch only has 8GB of storage, and only 2GB of that can be used to store your songs. That breaks down to roughly 200 songs, which is more than enough to get through a workout without your iPhone. You'll also be able to store photos on the Apple Watch, with 75MB of storage reserved for the Photos app. That's not much, but photos are downsized when downloaded from iCloud Photo Library, which will let you keep something around 100 photos on your wrist, according to 9to5Mac. The rest of the storage will be taken up by the OS and resources from other apps. And if you're thinking about spending more for the  $10,000 Edition to get extra storage, that won't work; it comes with 8GB too.\nVerge Video: It's finally here- Reviewing the Apple Watch\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
