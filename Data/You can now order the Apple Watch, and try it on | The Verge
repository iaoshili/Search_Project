{"Main text":"You can now order the Apple Watch, and try it on\nAnd the new MacBook is now shipping\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Apple Watch is now available to order, along with the new 12-inch MacBook. Apple is taking orders for both in its online store and the Apple Store app from 3:01AM ET, and it's actually the only way you can buy the Watch during the \"initial launch period.\" However, the Watch is available for preview in Apple Stores around the world, and today also sees three pop-up shops open in Tokyo, London, and Paris department stores. Deliveries for the Watch will begin on April 24th, while the MacBook starts shipping today. The Watch is available in the US, UK, China, Japan, Australia, France, Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong.\nApple's new Concierge site is also live, letting you schedule appointments for Watch fittings. The Concierge overhaul to the Genius Bar appointment system was first rumored in February .\nApple expects that \"strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,\" according to retail chief Angela Ahrendts, so now is the time to order if you're interested in the Watch. Delivery dates for some models are already pushing into May and even August. Apple's website has held up better than it did when orders opened for the iPhone 6; the US store went down for hours , frustrating customers who'd woken up in the middle of the night.\n","Title":"You can now order the Apple Watch, and try it on | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
