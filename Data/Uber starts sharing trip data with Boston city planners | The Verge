{"Main text":"Uber starts sharing trip data with Boston city planners\nAnonymized statistics to be used in the fight against congestion\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUnder fire from regulators  around the world , Uber is trying to make friends in the city of Boston by providing its municipal government with anonymized data on all the rides it serves in the area. Specifically, Uber will inform Boston's authorities about the distance traveled, the starting time and duration of a trip, and the zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) of the pick-up and drop-off. Much like the way Jawbone's Up fitness tracker can give insight on  the sleeping patterns of a population , Uber's granular stats can help inform Boston's city and traffic planners by identifying the ebbs and flows of private transit.\nThe coding of trips according to ZCTA may make the rider superficially anonymous, but the level of detail could still lead to some trips being identifiable to a particular person. Still, Uber believes it's the right approach and promises it \"will champion municipal efforts devoted to achieving data-driven urban growth, mobility and safety for communities.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
