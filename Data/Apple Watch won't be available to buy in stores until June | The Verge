{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple isn\u2019t planning to sell its Watch in retail stores until June. A leaked memo,  obtained by The Telegraph , reveals that Apple Watch orders will be online-only for weeks after its initial launch next Friday. \"We expect this to continue through the month of May,\" says Angela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s retail chief. While the company had previously revealed  Apple Watch sales would be taken online \"during the initial launch period,\" it wasn\u2019t clear this would extend to the end of May.\nApple will contine to launch products in stores in future\n\"Are we going to launch every product this way from now on? No,\" says Ahrendts in the leaked memo. \"We all love those blockbuster Apple product launch days - and there will be many more to come.\" For now, don\u2019t plan on camping outside Apple Stores for at least a month if you want to avoid internet ordering for an Apple Watch. With sales online-only for at least a month, it does question the usefulness of  Apple\u2019s dedicated pop-up stores in Paris, Tokyo, and London . Customers will be able to try the Apple Watch at these locations, but orders will still need to be placed online.\nApple is also opening special separate boutique stores in Paris, London, Los Angeles, Berlin, China, and Japan, and the company previously noted the Apple Watch would be \"available\" at these stores on April 24th. Whether available means to simply try on or purchase in-store is not clear, and we\u2019ve reached out to Apple for clarification around the leaked memo and its launch plans. We\u2019ll update you accordingly.\n","Title":"Apple Watch won't be available to buy in stores until June | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
