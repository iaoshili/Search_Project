{"Main text":"Features\nA real stand against antibiotic resistance starts at the farm, not the hospital\nWe know that animals are the biggest consumers of antibiotics \u2014 so why doesn't the US government's efforts on antibiotic resistance pay more attention to farms?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe US government made history on September 18th when President Obama signed an executive order establishing a task force to combat antibiotic resistance at the federal level. The order outlined general goals such as tracking the use of antibiotics and creating incentives for drug development. Some applauded the announcement, while pointing out other countries\u2019 continued failure to do the same.\nAntibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to humans worldwide, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a professional group of disease specialists. It costs the US health-care system over $21 billion each year to treat resistant infections. Those treatments aren\u2019t always successful, though: antibiotic resistance claims about 23,000 lives in the US each year, from its more than 2 million annual illnesses across the country.\nBut even though America has taken some steps to help curb superbugs, infectious disease researchers and doctors just don\u2019t think the government\u2019s strategy is enough. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t take into account some major consumers of antibiotics: farm animals.\nThere's not the same control [on antibiotic use in animals] as there is in people\nApproximately 80 percent of antibiotics are used on animals, not humans. \"There\u2019s not the same    control or restriction on their use as there is in people,\" says    Stuart Levy, a microbiologist at Tufts University who has spoken out    against the overuse of antibiotics for 30 years. And some of the drugs    used on animals are medically important for humans. So  when   they\u2019re overused in animals, we humans end up with bacterial   infections  that our drugs can\u2019t treat.\nResistance occurs when bacteria encounter antibiotics in their    environment in doses too small to kill them. This allows them to adapt    to the drugs in ways that help them resist to larger doses in the    future. And although many emerge from human antibiotic use (about 50 percent of people who take antibiotics don\u2019t actually need them), it\u2019s thought that the    large quantities of antibiotics given to livestock for disease    prevention, treatment, and growth purposes leads to people ingesting bacteria that doesn\u2019t respond to antibiotics. That\u2019s why some epidemiologists    and infectious disease experts are stung that the agricultural uses of    antibiotics didn\u2019t receive more attention in the bill.\nObama\u2019s plan largely glossed over the use of antibiotics in agriculture\nObama\u2019s  plan largely glossed over the use of antibiotics in  agriculture.  Besides banning their use for growth purposes \u2014 something  the FDA had  already announced it would do in December 2013 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t address the preventative use loopholes that remain. \"I   think it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\" Levy says, \"but we wanted a   leap.\"\nOther scientists were more blunt in voicing their discontent. \"It  reads as if it had been written by someone either from the meat  industry, or the vet drug industry,\" says James Johnson, an infectious  disease researcher at the University of Minnesota. Although the  government\u2019s strategy bans the use of antibiotics for growth purposes,  Johnson says, one could easily continue to use them for that purpose,  and call it a preventative measure. \"The language is the standard party  line about how antibiotic use in animals makes stronger animals \u2014 that  it\u2019s all wonderful. But that\u2019s just one perspective, and I don\u2019t think  it\u2019s a science-based perspective.\"\nA better strategy, would be to change the way meat is produced  in the US, says Lindsay Grayson, an infectious disease researcher at  the University of Melbourne, in Australia. Large-scale chicken farms,  for instance, can scale down their use of antibiotics by thinking in  terms of infection control. Physically separating different batches of  birds and minimizing overcrowding is key, he says. That way, when one  bird gets sick, the bird can be diagnosed before disease spreads. \"No  one is against using antibiotics to treat sick animals,\" he  says, \"but we shouldn\u2019t endorse mass preventive use on a daily basis  simply because your farming practices allow for rapid spread.\"\nA typical antibiotics user - USDA\/Lance Cheung.\nNot everyone is of this opinion, however. Christine Hoang, assistant director of scientific activities at the American Veterinary Medicine Association, says the goals outlined by the Obama administration are good enough. They reflect the FDA\u2019s stance on antibiotics use in food production and the intention to phase out growth promotion uses, she says. \"There aren't really any loopholes,\" Hoang says. Under Obama\u2019s plan, drugs will be used to treat and prevent disease, she says, and there will be more veterinary oversight. \"I don't think we should limit antibiotic use any more. It's a great detriment to us as a profession, as well as to animal welfare, to restrict them further.\"\nHoang\u2019s take was echoed by Paula Cray, microbiologist at North Carolina State University and former leader of the USDA\u2019s Bacterial Epidemiology and Antimicrobial Resistance Research Unit, who added that the planet will be home to 4 billion additional humans by 2100, all of which will expect to be fed. \"There\u2019s a need to double the production of animal protein,\" she says. And that kind of production \u2014 the kind that presumes that every human will want to eat meat \u2014 will take a certain capacity, one that may not be compatible with less crowded animal housing practices.\nThis might very well be the thought process behind the US antibiotic plan. Instead of trying to change farming practices \u2014 which guarantees a painful fight with large agricultural corporations \u2014 the government has opted to push for the development of new drugs, ones that will be used on either humans or animals, but not both. Accordingly, the US has promised to support basic research and \"leverage existing partnerships\" that will help reduce the obstacles that pharmaceutical companies face during clinical trials. The White House also pledged to inject drug research with an additional $800 million a year to develop new medicines. That may not be enough.\nThere aren't really any loopholes\n\"I\u2019m   not sure that the incentive part will get the pipeline full,\" says   Henry Chambers, chair of the Antimicrobial Resistance Committee at the   Infectious Diseases Society of America. Developing a new drug costs about $5 billion . When companies make that kind of an   investment, it\u2019s because they expect sales numbers for the drug to be   high enough to turn a profit. But when doctors encounter a new   antibiotic, their instinctive reaction is to use it sparingly, so they   have it on a rainy day.\n\"The   first inclination is to say, \u2018Wow this is really good, we better not  use  it because resistance will occur,'\" Chambers says. Besides, new   antibiotics might not be better than the old ones, he says. And some,   such as ciproflaxin and daptomycin ,   may have serious side-effects. Doctors who choose new antibiotics therefore end up making their patients purchase drugs that are probably   just as effective, but far more expensive.\nWhen you look at it that way, Chambers says, the incentive for doctors to   use new drugs isn\u2019t all that high. And without doctors pushing the drugs out to patients, drug companies aren\u2019t as likely to profit off their $5 billion investment. For many companies, even the government  incentives  don\u2019t make antibiotics as appealing as blood-pressure pills  and cancer  medications.\nMagic bullets no more - photo by Iqbal Osman\nThe US can\u2019t fight off superbugs alone, of course. Countries need to talk to each other when they encounter new health-care challenges, or when they find solutions. The sooner scientists and policy-makers know about new resistance, the easier it is to slow the organisms\u2019 spread. Right now, there\u2019s no fast way to do that, Cray says.\nAlso crucial are better diagnostics. Remember the 50 percent of people who take antibiotics and don\u2019t need them? Cray, Levy, and Johnson all say that aiming antibiotics only at people who need them is key. To do that, faster tests may be needed to separate people who really require antibiotic treatment from those who don\u2019t. Right now, doctors don\u2019t always determine whether something is a bacterial infection before prescribing antibiotics, if they test at all.\n\"What an idiotic species.\"\n\"With our current tests, even if they\u2019re done, many take several days and by then people have already taken antibiotics,\" Johnson says. Quicker tests are starting to trickle down to physicians, he says, but they rarely come cheap. Finding ways to accelerate test development \u2014 and lower prices \u2014 could do a lot more than finding novel antibiotics. But Obama\u2019s plan only provides $20 million for the development of a rapid diagnostic tests, a small sum when compared to the $800 million going to drug development.\nSince antibiotics were discovered in 1942, we\u2019ve wasted a lot of them, Grayson says. \"If you were an alien standing on Mars, and looking down on the Earth \u2014 on humans \u2014  you would say, \u2018What an idiotic species!\u2019\" So it\u2019s good that the president is doing something, even if it isn\u2019t as comprehensive as experts at hoped. At least it\u2019s a start, Grayson says.\nOf course, one of the most important steps to take in curbing antibiotic resistance remains the one that has evaded us for over 70 years: education. Teaching the public about proper antibiotic use \"really has to be developed,\" Cray says. Even basic levels of public education on antibiotic use are lacking. For instance, says Cray, lots of people still think antibiotics will help them get over a cold. That\u2019s wrong, since colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria. The real preventive strategy for viral infections is usually a vaccine, but lots of people go to doctors and ask for antibiotics anyway; sometimes doctors even prescribe them. That contributes to antibiotic resistance too.\n\"I don\u2019t think everyone needs a deep understanding, but we should have some idea of how things work,\" she says.\n","Title":"A real stand against antibiotic resistance starts at the farm, not the hospital | The Verge","Tags":["features","science","us-world"]}
