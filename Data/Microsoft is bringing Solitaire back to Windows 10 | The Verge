{"Main text":"Microsoft is bringing Solitaire back to Windows 10\nNostalgia trumps productivity\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDespite admitting games like Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts \" have a devoted following ,\" Microsoft chose to remove them from Windows 8. While overhauled and modern versions were  available in the Windows Store , there\u2019s nothing quite as nostalgic as navigating to Start > Programs> Accessories > Games, and finding the classic Windows games. Microsoft is now bringing back Solitaire as a built-in game on Windows 10. It\u2019s the same modern version from Windows 8, but you no longer have to search around the Windows Store to find it and play.\nIt\u2019s a similar decision to the  return of the Start Menu , bringing back features Windows users are familiar with. Only Solitaire is back as a built-in app so far, and that may even change by the time Windows 10 ships in the summer. If you\u2019re a fan of Minesweeper or Hearts then you\u2019ll still need to search for both in the Windows Store, or just admit defeat to Solitaire and spend your office day shuffling virtual cards instead of working on that important Excel spreadsheet.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Windows 10\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
