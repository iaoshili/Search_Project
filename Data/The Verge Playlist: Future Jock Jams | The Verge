{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt some point on Sunday, if you\u2019re watching the Super Bowl, you\u2019ll hear a familiar sound. Not the sound of a referee making a bad call, or the sound of an abandoned hot dog falling to the floor,  or the sound of  half-drunk fans growling at other half-drunk fans. No, I'm talking about the sound of jock jams; the only sound capable of satisfying an entire stadium of aggressively competitive people with  a lot of money . There's \"Tootsie Roll,\" \"Pump Up The Jam,\" \"It Takes Two.\" Even if you haven't listened to those songs in years, I bet you can hear them in your head right now if you try.\nInspired by the mid-90s compilation tapes of the same name, I\u2019ve put together a playlist of \"Future Jock Jams.\" Not songs that will be jock jams in the future, but songs that already are jock jams of the future.  It\u2019s mostly a collection of polished future-funk sprinkled with enough sucrose to make your dentist hate you, but there\u2019s also Makonnen and his lounge-singer drawl, one muddled Travis Scott remix, and a gurgling rework of Popcaan, the Jamaican dancehall artist who put out  one of the best albums of 2014 . Personally, I\u2019ve got no love for the NFL, but this playlist will make you feel like you could pull off a 27-yard interception up-the-middle reverse-sweep at the fourth down. Or whatever.\nLate Ride - Swear\n","Title":"The Verge Playlist: Future Jock Jams | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3834807"]}
