{"Main text":"Microsoft's next Windows 10 preview will include the Project Spartan browser\nHere comes the Internet Explorer successor\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is planning to let Windows 10 testers experiment with its brand new Internet Explorer replacement, Project Spartan, very soon. While Microsoft first  demonstrated the new browser at its Windows 10 event in January , testers have been waiting eagerly to try Project Spartan. Microsoft's technical lead for Windows universal apps, Kevin Gallo, confirmed at Mobile World congress today that the company will release a test version of the browser in the next Windows 10 preview. It's not clear exactly when that will be available, but sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that it should arrive by the end of March, and likely a lot sooner.\nMicrosoft briefly demonstrated Project Spartan on Windows 10 for phones during a press event earlier today at Mobile World Congress. The browser looks similar to the desktop counterpart, and it's reasonable to assume both the phone and desktop versions of the next Windows 10 preview will feature Spartan.  Gallo demonstrated a number of universal test apps using a new version of the Windows 10 preview. Build 10026 was running on Gallo\u2019s machine, so Windows 10 testers will likely receive a similarly numbered build once it\u2019s publicly available later this month. Separately, Microsoft is also planning to preview its Office apps for Windows 10 on phones in the next few weeks. In an interview with The Verge, Microsoft Office product manager Julia White confirmed they will be made available to Windows 10 testers this month.\n","Title":"Microsoft's next Windows 10 preview will include the Project Spartan browser | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech","mwc-2015"]}
