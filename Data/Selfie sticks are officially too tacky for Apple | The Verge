{"Main text":"Selfie sticks are officially too tacky for Apple\nTake your stick and go home\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI have a deep hatred of the selfie stick (and a deeper hatred of people who hold up their phone for the duration of a concert).  Not everyone on staff agrees with me, but at least Apple does. The creators of the scourge known as  iPad photography have banned selfie sticks from its  Worldwide Developers Conference , apparently not looking to support anything that further compromises the audience's viewing experience. \"You may not use selfie sticks or similar monopods within Moscone West or Yerba Buena Gardens,\" Apple  wrote on its WWDC page today.\nApple bans selfie sticks from WWDC. pic.twitter.com\/hGzgfACgph\n\u2014 Chris Welch (@chriswelch) April 14, 2015\nJust like  Coachella, Lollapalooza , and apparently every halfway decent  art museum in the world , Apple will not allow a room filled with floating sticks to ruin the viewing experience for others. Now we all can stare lustfully at the next versions of iOS and OS X without the risk of a concussion. Thank you, Apple.
