Today, the company announced that it's rolling out audio descriptions, which are narration tracks that describe \"what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes.\" The first series to get audio descriptions is Netflix's newest  (and very good) original series Daredevil , and it's something  comic book fans have been asking for . To feature an original series starring a blind protagonist \u2014 while not doing all it could to accommodate blind customers \u2014 has recently put  Netflix's lacking accessibility options through fresh scrutiny.\nBut the company says audio descriptions will quickly be expanded beyond just Daredevil to include House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, and Marco Polo. Narration tracks for those shows will be added in the \"coming weeks,\" and Netflix says customers can access them like any other alternate audio track. Netflix isn't stopping with its own original programming though, pledging that it's \"actively committed to increasing the number of audio-visual translations for movies and shows\" in a blog post today. Discussions with studios and content owners to move that effort along are ongoing, and Netflix is \"also exploring adding audio description into other languages in the future.\"\n","Title":"Netflix gives blind fans of Daredevil the audio descriptions they asked for | The Verge","Tags":["apps","hd-home","tech"]}
