{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHTC is expected to announce the One M9 in just a few days at Mobile World Congress, but as is often the case with new smartphones, virtually  all of the details about the device have leaked beforehand. We've already seen renders of what the M9 will look like (it looks like the M8 with a bigger camera module and no DuoCam sensor), but now three promotional videos have been published on YouTube  by user upleaks .\nThe videos show off the design of the phone, with it's two-tone color scheme, the new camera's capabilities and software, and a more in depth theming system than on prior HTC phones. The videos also show a new home screen that will show you different apps based on your location, similar to Yahoo's Aviate contextual launcher. The camera apparently can capture better selfies in low light, as well as let you edit your images with more powerful tools. And the BoomSound feature has also been apparently upgraded with Dolby Audio surround sound.\nBut for the most part, the M9 appears to be the same phone as the M8, but with better front and rear cameras, new software, and likely more powerful internal components. Oh, and the power button has been moved from the top of the phone to the side. Whether those minor aesthetic changes are a good thing or not is up to personal taste, but few would argue that the M8's problems last year had anything to do with design. With just a few days left until HTC's press conference, will the company have anything left to show?\n","Title":"New HTC One M9 detailed in leaked promotional videos | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech","mwc-2015"]}
