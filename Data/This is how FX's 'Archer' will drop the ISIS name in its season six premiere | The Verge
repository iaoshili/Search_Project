As in, the same acronym (formerly) used by  mobile wallet company Soft Card \u2014 and more importantly, an acronym  used by an active Islamic militant group . At this weekend's  New York Comic Con , the cast and crew confirmed that the name ISIS will no longer be a part of the show.\nAs described by executive producer Matt Thompson, the only visual representation will be movers rolling away a large ISIS sign in the background behind Jessica Walter's character Malory Archer. A few other ISIS signs have been painting out and the name will not again be spoken aloud.  According to The Daily Beast , Walters recorded new lines to stress that everyone now works for the CIA, following the events of season five, \"Archer Vice.\" The militant group, meanwhile, does not and will not exist in the show's universe.\nAnd now for this amusing anecdote from show creator Adam Reed:\n\"I was at a meeting with the FX execs and I said, \u2018You know, with all this extra ISIS merchandise, you should just make the bad guys buy it.' Dead silence. And then they said, \u2018We have a lot of ISIS merchandise.' So I guess that's all going to a landfill somewhere.\"\nIndeed, the only trace of ISIS we could find was in the  category descriptions of FX's Archer shop (\"Caffeine and scotch are critical when you're an undercover ISIS agent\") and that's probably going to change soon enough, too.\nSeason six of Archer will premiere in early 2015.\n","Title":"This is how FX's 'Archer' will drop the ISIS name in its season six premiere | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
