{"Main text":"I hate that I love this Coke commercial\nThe best Coca-Cola ad has no Coke in it at all\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, I'm no fan of sugary drinks. This is why I find myself so conflicted over this delightful new ad campaign for Coca-Cola, produced by Ogilvy in Paris. There's no product, branding, or logo anywhere in the shot, except for the negative space between a pair of mismatched hands coming together to form the Coke bottle . It's a subtle reminder of the most iconic piece of contoured glass of the past century \u2014Â which is fitting since the campaign is designed to celebrate the centenary of the original 1915 Coca-Cola bottle. I just wish this kind of clever advertising could be put to use when promoting carrots instead of caffeine .\nSide note about Ogilvy: the Parisian ad agency is also responsible for one of Neil deGrasse Tyson's favorite commercials , featuring a daring mission to stop the Sun from melting the Earth with the help of Perrier bottled water.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
