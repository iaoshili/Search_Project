{"Main text":"You can now 3D-print the new Star Wars lightsaber\nBring the internet's favorite conversation piece offline\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBy this time next year, the crossguard lightsaber seen in the  new Star Wars: The Force Awakens teaser will be in every toy store for about $25 (our estimate based on  current market value for plastic lightsaber toys ). But why wait? If you happen to have access to a 3D printer, you can create your own 3D printer using these files provided by Le FabShop and a lot of PLA filament. Then, present the lightsaber to your most pedantic friends to argue (in a physical space) whether or not the hilt is really protective, hazardous, or just really cool. (Full-length black cowl and  the gravely voice of Andy Serkis are not included.)\nFriendly reminder: it's only been about eight days since the 88-second teaser came out and already we're  already inundated with  an abundance of  awesome fan-made creations .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
