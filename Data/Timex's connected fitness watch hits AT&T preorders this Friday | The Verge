{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAT&T today announced that theÂ  Timex Ironman One GPS+ fitness watch will be available for preorder starting this Friday, November 7th. The Ironman One GPS+ is a fully connected 3G fitness tracker that can map your runs, share your location, and send and receive messages without the help of a smartphone. It will cost $399.99 and comes with one year of service. Service for the One GPS+ will cost $40 per year beyond the first year that's included.\nThe One GPS+ is a chunky, rubbery device, but it's designed to withstand sweat and abuse that happens during intense workouts or runs. It's water resistant for up to 50 meters, so it can be worn while swimming too. The tracking system lets wearers share their location with others on both private and public levels, and its data can be synced with a variety of fitness databases, such as MapMyFitness.\nThe display uses Qualcomm's Mirasol technology, so it's easily visible outdoors in direct sunlight. The watch is a bit clunky, but it's lighter than I expected. Most people probably won't want to wear it all the time, but it's much more convenient to wear while running than a 5-inch smartphone strapped to your bicep. The smartwatch functions are limited to a messaging service that uses a special email address just for the One GPS+. There are no apps or other smartwatch features to mention, but that's probably for the better.\nYou don't actually have to be an existing AT&T customer to purchase the One GPS+, though outside of specialty running shops, AT&T stores will carry the device exclusively. The carrier says it may introduce options to add the One GPS+ to its Mobile Share plans once users exhaust the first year of included service.\nIn addition to the One GPS+, AT&T announced today that the FiLiP 2 smart locator device for children ages 4 to 11 will also be available for purchase starting this Friday. The FiLiP 2 will cost $99.99 until January 7th, 2015, after which it will be $149.99.\n","Title":"Timex's connected fitness watch hits AT&T preorders this Friday | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
