{"Main text":"Microsoft has a strange obsession with productivity\n'Getting things done' meets marketing madness\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft started with a mission during the \u201880s to put \"a computer on every desk in every home.\" Having achieved that, the new Microsoft has bigger, more ambitious goals in an era where personal computing is moving to a mobile world Microsoft doesn\u2019t dominate. Computers aren't just working tools anymore, they're components of our entire life. Apple is about creativity and simplicity; Google is about interconnectivity.\nMicrosoft has chosen productivity.\nProductivity is at the center of everything Microsoft is now building across multiple rival platforms, a shift from the company\u2019s focus on its own devices and services just a year ago under former CEO Steve Ballmer. Productivity is the new buzzword that Microsoft is slapping on everything from a fitness band to a tablet, as the company attempts to find its niche against huge competition from the likes of Apple, Amazon, and Google.\nProductivity, productivity, productivity\nThere are examples everywhere you look in the corporate catalog. \" Your productivity will soar \" with Microsoft\u2019s Cortana digital assistant. Microsoft\u2019s new fitness band will teach you to \" live healthier and be more productive .\" Office helps \" more than a billion people be more productive. \" Surface Pro 3 is the \" most productive tablet on the planet .\" As evidenced by its own words, Microsoft is obsessed with productivity.\nProblem is, it\u2019s not a sexy word. It might not be the right one to sell Microsoft\u2019s products, even if productivity is what the company does best (Office, for instance). Most people don\u2019t wake up in the morning with an overpowering desire or need to be more productive. Productivity implies work. It\u2019s a management philosophy, the desire to get more out of their workforce, the stuff of industrial revolutions. You don\u2019t buy a fitness band to \"be more productive\" in the same way that you wouldn\u2019t buy a more productive cereal to eat at breakfast.\nMicrosoft needs to understand why someone wants to use a computer, not why they need to use it.\nConsumers use products because they\u2019re simple, convenient, and sometimes because there\u2019s an element of emotional attachment or trust to a particular brand or company. Productivity, meanwhile, is emotionless \u2014 it\u2019s an idea that evokes feelings of being controlled by your boss or tied to an assembly line, rather than something that delights.\n\"It\u2019s fair to say that productivity as just a single word doesn\u2019t have that emotional appeal.\"\nMicrosoft does at least appear to understand that its continued use of the word productivity everywhere is bizarre. \"It\u2019s fair to say that productivity as just a single word doesn\u2019t have that emotional appeal,\" admitted CEO Satya Nadella at the company\u2019s Future Decoded event in London yesterday. Nadella didn\u2019t really answer what productivity means, but communications chief Frank Shaw has  his own take on Microsoft\u2019s new buzzword .\n\"Productivity is simply a way of thinking about how well we use our time,\" argues Shaw, as he defines Microsoft\u2019s understanding of productivity. Microsoft says it\u2019s now aiming to create natural and intelligent tools that don\u2019t require people to learn how they work, and that can anticipate and prioritize the things that matter across any device. \"Our customers are not constrained by an outdated definition of this thing called \u2018productivity.\u2019 And neither are we,\" says Shaw.\nMicrosoft\u2019s focus on its core strengths of software, platforms, and getting things done is a good approach for the company, the approach to selling it all is weird: instead of telling us we can be more productive, why doesn\u2019t Microsoft just handle it, so we can get on with our lives? \"We\u2019ll worry about your productivity, you worry about everything else.\" There are early signs that\u2019s exactly what Microsoft plans to do, especially with things like Microsoft Band, Cortana, and 3D sound that  put technology secondary to experience \u2014 but today, it\u2019s still shoving the productivity label down our throats.\nMicrosoft is bringing its software and services to iOS and Android in a big way\nIt\u2019s not that productivity doesn\u2019t make money, it\u2019s just not the best way to appeal to regular human beings. The Surface Pro 3 tablet debuted earlier this year, positioned as a laptop killer and productivity tablet \u2014 the type that professionals and creatives could use to get things done \u2014 and it actually appears to be paying off, judging from  Microsoft\u2019s most recent earnings . Microsoft is even making other devices like the iPad more \"productive,\" thanks to  cross-platform software like Office and services like OneDrive. While Ballmer was preoccupied with Windows everywhere, the new Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella, is bringing the company\u2019s software and services to iOS and Android in a big way.\nDespite all the talk of productivity, there are also signs the company wants to balance work and life instead of slowly turning into another IBM or Dell. A new bundle combines all of Microsoft\u2019s main consumer services into a single subscription, for instance, and the company is still focused on Outlook.com, OneDrive, Xbox, and Skype.\nSo Microsoft is already building this work-life balance into its products, but the marketing message is confused and corporate. If there\u2019s one big positive change that comes out of Microsoft\u2019s obsession with productivity, it\u2019s a single vision \u2014 mission first, platform second \u2014 that could help with the company\u2019s culture that has focused far too much on protecting Windows over the years. Ultimately, it\u2019s also a defensive move: Microsoft can\u2019t face a future where businesses start to switch away from its software and services, so it needs to be everywhere. Positioning itself as the company that helps you get things done on every device you own could be the best way for Microsoft to stay relevant.\nProductivity might just not be the best word for it.\n","Title":"Microsoft has a strange obsession with productivity | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","editorial","tech"]}
