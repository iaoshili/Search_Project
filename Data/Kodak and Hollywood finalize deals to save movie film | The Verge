{"Main text":"Kodak and Hollywood finalize deals to save movie film\n'Film has long been \u2014 and will remain \u2014 a vital part of our culture.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFollowing a high-profile period of lobbying by directors such as Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino, Kodak has secured agreements with movie studios to keep supplying them with motion picture film. Sony Pictures, Paramount, NBC Universal, Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and Disney will all continue as major customers of Kodak's film stock, guaranteeing the technology's future at the storied imaging company.\n\"Film has long been \u2014 and will remain \u2014 a vital part of our culture,\" Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement. \"With the support of the studios, we will continue to provide motion picture film, with its unparalleled richness and unique textures, to enable filmmakers to tell their stories and demonstrate their art.\"Â Kodak is essentially the only company still producing film for movies after Fujifilm left the market in 2013.\nAlthough digital imaging has swept the industry with its convenience, ease of use, and cost-effective nature, several directors still prefer to use film for its inherent qualities. Recent movies like Boyhood, Interstellar, and The Imitation Game were all shot on film, and upcoming blockbusters including Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, Jurassic World, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice will be filmed using Kodak products.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
