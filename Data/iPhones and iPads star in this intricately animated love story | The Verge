The latest example of this comes from Ukrainian band Brunettes Shoot Blondes, whose single \"Knock Knock\" has been set to an endearing animated love story taking place across a variety of iPhones, iPads, iPods, and a trio of MacBook laptops. Apple's products provide the stage, but it's the creativity and finesse of the animation that really make this video worth watching. Snippets of the story play on each device for mere seconds, as it jumps around from iPhone to iPad and back to phone. This classic tale of courtship crashes its way through the iOS home screen, tumbles across a series of iPhones, and ultimately provides a satisfying - if somewhat predictable - conclusion.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
