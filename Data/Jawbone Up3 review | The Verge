It\u2019s \u201Cthe world\u2019s most advanced tracker,\u201D according to Jawbone\u2019s marketing campaign. Put it next to the $99 Up2 or last year\u2019s Up24, and the company will point out that the Up3 contains more sensors, and that those sensors have more advanced capabilities. From a technology perspective, sure, this $179 Up3 is the best device Jawbone has produced. But is that enough for it to stand up against a new wave of competition?\nCompanies big and small are trying to build the one true fitness companion that wraps around your wrist; on the high end, Jawbone is facing off against Microsoft Band and Apple Watch. On the low end, it\u2019s got companies like Misfit eager to establish a spot. And then there\u2019s longtime rival Fitbit, which recently rolled out its own updated lineup of health trackers. I\u2019ve recently taken a greater interest in staying fit and maintaining some semblance of a healthy lifestyle, so the Up3 arrived at a pretty great time for me. I just wish it were a better product.\nThe Up3 features a design that\u2019s not far off from the less-expensive Up2. It\u2019s a bit larger and chunkier overall to accommodate for the added technology inside, but not noticeably so if you\u2019re looking at the thing on someone\u2019s wrist. Most of the Up3\u2019s guts are located inside an aluminum casing that sits on the top of your wrist. The Up3 is splash-proof and safe for the shower, but you won\u2019t want to submerge it. After originally promising that it would be fully waterproof (a requirement for swimmers), Jawbone realized during mass production that it couldn\u2019t follow through and had to go back on its word. The downgrade is disappointing, but you can\u2019t take Microsoft Band or the Apple Watch underwater, either.\nAs it turns out, some of the Up3\u2019s most important sensors are actually located on the inside of its strap. Look at the band\u2019s underside and you\u2019ll see a total of five gold-colored squares that make contact with your skin whenever it\u2019s strapped on. These are what separate the Up3 from all the Ups that have come before it. They\u2019re bioimpedance sensors that can measure your resting heart rate and make the Up3\u2019s improved sleep-tracking features possible by monitoring your respiration rate, body temperature, and galvanic skin response.\nShowering's fine, but don't take it in a pool\nWith these, the Up3 can track the stages of your sleep every night between light, deep, and REM. That\u2019s something the Up2 won\u2019t do. Instead, the less expensive model guesses your sleep patterns based on movement using its accelerometer.\nUnfortunately, the Up3 has the same poorly designed, awkward clasp as the Up2. Worse yet, it doesn\u2019t even guarantee a secure fit; the Up3 has randomly come loose on a few occasions over the week I\u2019ve been wearing it. It\u2019s never happened while I was asleep, but it still makes me think there had to be a better, simpler way. If there's one plus, it's that you won't be taking it off frequently. The Up3's battery life is exceptional, and it'll last nearly a week on a single charge.\nA word of advice on style: go with the black one. Jawbone gave me a gray-and-silver model for review, and I never once received a compliment for its appearance. Like most other fitness bands, the black version won\u2019t attract much attention. But this one? It screams, \"Oh, that\u2019s one of those fitness things.\"\nThe best thing about this product is Jawbone\u2019s app on your smartphone. I came away impressed with its ability to automatically detect when I\u2019d started working out or fallen asleep. Jawbone does give you the option to manually switch between activity and sleep-tracking modes, and you really should, since it\u2019s the only way for the Up3 to figure out how long it takes for you to fall asleep.\nBut to make that switch, you have to suffer through a pretty awful user experience. Your physical interactions with the Up3 (and Up2) are based around a bewildering system of taps. Tap twice to wake it up, and then hold to toggle between modes. That\u2019d be simple enough if it worked reliably every time, but I regularly found myself tapping repeatedly to trigger the lights hidden beneath the Up3\u2019s aluminum housing. Too often, it just didn\u2019t register. Next time, they should really put a button on it. Jawbone has told me that the sensitivity around these controls might be fine-tuned in a coming firmware update.\nTap, tap, tap, tap, tap\nBack to the software: Jawbone\u2019s Smart Coach system is pretty great. After picking a daily step goal (I\u2019ve learned 10,000 takes some effort), you can set progress alerts so the band will vibrate every 3,000 steps or at another interval of your choosing. Smart Coach constantly keeps you updated on the previous day\u2019s progress and how you stack up against the Jawbone community at large. I felt a decent sense of accomplishment after seeing that my daily step average ranks in the top 30 percent; sometimes it\u2019s these and other little messages of encouragement that prove most effective. The system tracks your activity milestones (like hitting 50,000 steps) and pushes you to try a bit harder by entering into \"Today I Will\" challenges that go beyond your daily goal.\nI\u2019m not someone who bothers with meal tracking or logging my weight. I\u2019ve found \"don\u2019t eat like an idiot or late at night\" is a sufficient strategy, and the process in Jawbone\u2019s app always proves to be too much of a hassle. Thankfully Jawbone\u2019s Up software lets you ignore both of these features entirely, and even better, it won\u2019t pester you about them. I also liked the Smart Alarm option, which attempts to wake you during a light stage of sleep at any point between your target wake-up time and 30 minutes beforehand.\nAnd that brings us to the heart. Initially, I was pretty excited as Jawbone executives spoke about the Up3\u2019s heart rate monitor. Whereas Apple, Microsoft, and most other fitness bands use LEDs and sophisticated algorithms to sample your blood flow and produce a best guess at your heart rate, Jawbone went with the sensors mentioned earlier. It\u2019s a lot like putting your finger on a treadmill\u2019s heart rate sensor; the Up3 \"measures the resistance of skin tissue to tiny electric currents,\" according to Jawbone. But is that more accurate than the path Fitbit, Microsoft, and Apple are pursuing? Well, it\u2019s impossible to know. Right now, Up3 only measures your resting heart rate. And it only does that once a day. One time.\nThis isn't much of a heart rate monitor\nJawbone\u2019s new flagship fitness tracker can\u2019t tell you how hard you\u2019re pushing your heart during a run or midway through your workout at the gym. It just won\u2019t do it. I even opened up Apple\u2019s Health app, hoping maybe it would pick up a reading as it does for my Polar chest strap: no dice. Measuring your heart rate during a workout is the key thing people expect when they see a fitness tracker has a monitor, and the Up3 just plain can\u2019t do it.\nJawbone\u2019s reasoning for this approach is that your resting heart rate is a good gauge of your overall health. Every morning when you wake up, Smart Coach will reveal your reading for that day. And when it notices spikes or sudden changes, the app will do its best to figure out why. Often this is tied directly to sleep; if Jawbone detects you had a lousy night\u2019s sleep or woke up multiple times, it\u2019ll urge you to head to bed sooner and try for better rest.\nDuring my time with the Up3 so far, my resting heart rate has averaged between 54 and 58 beats per minute. That\u2019s a bit below the wide range Jawbone says is recommended by the American Heart Association (betwen 60bpm and 100bpm). But Smart Coach never explained why. It\u2019s not a big difference, and I attribute it to the fact that I put in 5 miles on the treadmill a few times each week. But right now, Smart Coach just basically says, \"Here\u2019s your number,\" and only puts in extra effort if it notices something irregular.\nI can\u2019t see how that\u2019s any better than what Microsoft is doing with the Band. Even if accuracy issues remain, I have to give Redmond credit for trying experimental things and pushing forward. Apple Watch\u2019s heart rate monitor is also said to be fairly on the mark, as is Fitbit\u2019s Charge HR. If keeping tabs on your heart rate is important to you, the Up3 just doesn\u2019t seem like the right choice. Hopefully Jawbone will update the device to expand its heart functionality. Otherwise, the best thing about all those advanced sensors is the sleep tracking.\nWhen I strapped on the Up3, I was optimistic this $179 thing could be just what I wanted from \"the world\u2019s most advanced\" fitness tracker. Jawbone has nailed the software end of things marvelously; Smart Coach can definitely help keep you motivated and aware of how much activity you\u2019re getting in every day. It\u2019s helpful and doesn\u2019t get obnoxious about health advice. That alone is a major selling point. Still, after all the months Jawbone spent working on the Up3, I figured this might be the perfect showcase for that mobile app. It\u2019s not.\nUp2 makes more sense for nearly everyone\nTo be clear, the Up3 isn\u2019t terrible. It\u2019s got all the same activity-tracking features as the Up2 and provides somewhat deeper sleep analysis compared to that $99 product. But it\u2019s by no means worth twice the price. I can\u2019t imagine many people will be willing to spend $180 for a single daily record of their resting heart rate. Is it really that useful of a reference for how your health goals are progressing?\nThis is a flagship product that can't make a compelling case against a cheaper option in Jawbone\u2019s own lineup. You\u2019re better off with the Up2. It\u2019s a perfectly fine tool for determining whether you\u2019ve moved around enough in a given day. And in the end, the Up3 is really only good for that same exact thing. (Don\u2019t expect much different from the upcoming Up4, as it\u2019s basically this very product, plus an American Express card on your wrist, for $200.)  I wanted far more out of this product. Using those fancy sensors to track my heart at the gym or during a run doesn\u2019t seem like too much to ask. Maybe next time.\nPhotos by Sean O'Kane.\n","Title":"Jawbone Up3 review | The Verge","Tags":["review","tech"]}
