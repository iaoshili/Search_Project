{"Main text":"HBO's sci-fi western 'Westworld' is coming next year with an insanely good cast\nAnthony Hopkins, Ed Harris, Evan Rachel Wood, and more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLooks like HBO was really happy with J. J. Abrams and Jonathan Nolan's Westworld pilot, an adaptation of Michael Crichton's 1973 novel of the same name. News of the pilot first came out  over a year ago ; today, accompanied by  some bizarre tweets (and the Vine, above), HBO has confirmed that Westworld will be given a full season order and will debut next year.\nThe premiere episode was directed by Jonathan Nolan (Interstellar co-writer and, yes, Christopher's brother) and co-written by both Nolan and Lisa Joy. The series will star Anthony Hopkins as an inventor who runs a futuristic theme park full of lifelike androids.  According to THR , James Marsden, Evan Rachel Wood, and Thandie Newton will portray the androids and can be killed and replaced frequently, giving everyone a chance to play multiple characters. (The cast reportedly signed multi-year deals.) Ed Harris, Miranda Otto, and Jeffrey Wright will also star in the series.\nThe sci-fi western is being executive produced by Abrams, his Bad Robot Productions co-founder Bryan Burk, Jerry Wentraub, Nolan and Joy. Jonathan Nolan is also working on an  adaptation of Isaac Asimov's Foundation for HBO .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
