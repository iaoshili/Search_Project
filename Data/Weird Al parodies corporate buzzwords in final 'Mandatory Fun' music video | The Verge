{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWeird Al's  final song in his eight days of music videos is sort of like your company's CEO on Auto-Tune: a bizarrely compelling string of often-meaningless buzzwords that sound great together. Called \"Mission Statement?,\" the song parodies the style of Crosby, Stills & Nash with a near-constant self-harmony of Al's vocals over a bit of jangling and quiet guitar. As for the lyrics, it's hard to say if they really mean anything in a straightforward way. His lines might make sense from moment to moment, but they're pretty meaningless as a whole: \"Invest in world-class technology \/ and enrich our core competencies \/ in order to holistically \/ administrate exceptional synergy,\" Al sings. You can watch the video over  at The Wall Street Journal .\nThe track's music video is truly what the song might call a value-added experience \u2014 itself a parody of the white-board animations that you see on YouTube videos  by RSA . They're well-made and interesting animations, but they often accompanying a dry talk with a name that begins with something like \"The Power of\u2026\". The premiere of \"Mission Statement?\" concludes Al's eight days of music video releases. The actual album that they're in support of, Mandatory Fun, has been out for nearly a week now, and it includes a few additional songs that didn't make the jump to video too, including a polka medley and an Imagine Dragons parody.\n","Title":"Weird Al parodies corporate buzzwords in final 'Mandatory Fun' music video | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5665968"]}
