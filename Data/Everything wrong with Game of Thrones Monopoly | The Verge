{"Main text":"Everything wrong with Game of Thrones Monopoly\nDo not pass go, do not commit heinous acts of violence\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTo think, there was a time when Game of Thrones merchandising was something of a rarity. That was ages ago; HBO's venerable and violent drama has been a runaway success , and with it comes more than 80 Game of Thrones licensees. There's even a series of books!\nThe biggest addition to the Game of Thrones merchandise catalog this year is the official Game of Thrones Monopoly, which is coming next month. I have some concerns:\nThere's free parking \u2014 probably because there are no cars.\nIn lieu of murder and \/ or mutilation, a grump, blue uniform-clad cop will put you in jail.\nNo nudity, a Game of Thrones staple.\nThe dragon egg token lands on House Targaryen but never turns into a dragon.\n... on a related note, the White Walker token roams free without anyone batting an eye and without first buying the Wall.\n... also, a direwolf can own property. Maybe that's not a problem so much as a potential spoiler.\nWinterfell is the third most expensive property in the game (300) behind only Braavos (350) and King's Landing (400).  Have you seen Winterfell lately?\nEvery player has a stipend. Survive long enough, and you'll definitely get paid fairly.\nGame of Thrones Monopoly has a single, unified currency from the Iron Bank of Braavos.\nThere is no mechanism for winning through violence.\nThus, we already know the winner of Game of Thrones Monopoly: capitalism. C.R.E.A.S.K. \u2014 Cash Rules Everything Around (the) Seven Kingdoms. There's no point to play anymore. Let me know if Game of Thrones Risk ever becomes a thing.\n(My colleague Adi Robertson has already provided the best counterpoint: both Game of Thrones and Monopoly can drag on forever, and you feel disgusted with humanity by the time you're finished.)\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Everything wrong with Game of Thrones Monopoly | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","photo-essay","entertainment","tv"]}
