{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOffice Depot kicks off its Black Friday sales on Thursday, November 27th with deals on Dell and Toshiba computers, and a ton of Android tablets. The big attraction on Black Friday proper is a Toshiba laptop that's $120 off its normal price. More of the deals arrive on Thursday, including up to $300 off a Dell Inspiron notebook, up to $100 off some Samsung Galaxy Tab models, and a handy 20 percent off $50 worth of iTunes gift cards.\nBe sure to read the fine print\nThere are a few things to keep in mind with some of these deals. Many of the tablets are only 8GB, which is not a lot of storage these days, so be sure to double check that you can expand it with a memory card. On something like the $79 Kindle Fire HD6 deal, that's mitigated by Amazon's offering of free unlimited storage for things like photos, but you still need somewhere to keep apps. Some products are also long in the tooth, including the Beats Ekocycle headphones, which are discounted by $130 but have been discontinued. If that kind of thing matters to you, read the fine print.\nThe Thursday sale starts at 12:01AM ET online, and 6PM in stores. The Friday deals also kick off a minute after midnight the following day, and at 8AM in stores.Â Here's how the deals break down by the day:\nThursday, November 27th\n","Title":"Office Depot's Black Friday deals include $179.99 Dell and $159.99 Toshiba laptops | The Verge","Tags":["tech","black-friday\",\"Story Streams\"","\"6957294"]}
