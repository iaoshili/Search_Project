{"Main text":"Lightroom 6 arrives with performance improvements and new tools\nAdobe\u2019s latest version of the photo editor is no revolution\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPhotographers and photo editors are about to hear some long-awaited news: Lightroom 6 is now available. It's available as part of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription \u2014 where it's called \"Lightroom CC\" \u2014 and as standalone software. But the excitement should be tempered, because the new version is really more of an update than a revolution.\nIt's been almost two years since Lightroom 5 was released, which at the time was a major update to the photo editing program's look and performance. The biggest change in this version of Lightroom is speed. Lightroom 6's performance is based heavily on your computer's GPU and processing power, but Adobe is promising speed increases on most modern machines. Even if you're using a MacBook Pro from four years ago, you'll still see an improvement in the overall performance and the speed of individual tools.\nThe biggest improvements are found in the rendering speed of the \"exposure\" and \"distort\" tools \u2014 changes made with these appeared much faster in the preview build of Lightroom 6 I used. Importing a large batch of images into your Lightroom catalog is also faster, but it still takes long enough that you might want to use the time to walk away from your computer or check Twitter.\nThe new Lightroom is faster, but it still crawls here and there\nRendering RAW images still takes some time, though. Lightroom spends a full second or more before you see a fully rendered version of the image you want to edit, so you're still going to want to use another program if you want to quickly inspect the full quality of your images.\nAdobe has added a few new features, the most notable ones being \"HDR merge\" and \"panorama merge.\" While HDR and panorama tools aren't revolutionary, these particular ones generate rich DNG files that can be edited without worrying much about quality loss (as opposed to working like a JPEG, which can degrade quickly).\nOther features announced today are the addition of facial recognition and finer control over the graduated filter tool. There's also DNG editing support on some devices running Android Lollipop \u2014 but only on DNG images taken by phones with that capability. Right now only a few phones can do that, like the OnePlus One and the Nexus 5 or 6.\n","Title":"Lightroom 6 arrives with performance improvements and new tools | The Verge","Tags":["photography","tech"]}
