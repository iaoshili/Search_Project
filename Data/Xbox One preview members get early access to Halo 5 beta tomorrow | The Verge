While 343 industries and Microsoft plan to launch a Halo 5 multiplayer beta on December 29th, Xbox One preview members will be able to play content from week one a whole 10 days early. The early access is invite-only, and all current Xbox One preview members should receive a message from Xbox Live tomorrow with two codes to obtain the download.\nHalo 5 multiplayer beta early access will start at 4PM ET tomorrow, and end at 3AM ET on December 22nd, giving Xbox One preview members the weekend before Christmas Day to get used to the new weapons, maps, and Spartan abilities. Those include a new Smart Scope option that gives you a scope on every weapon, and a Ground Pound ability, that\u2019s very similar to Destiny\u2019s First of Havoc slam, to let you drop down from the air and attack enemies. We were impressed with our  early look at Halo 5 multiplayer , noting that it returns to what made Halo great.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
