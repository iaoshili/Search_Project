{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSeinfeld co-creator Larry David is headed to Broadway.  The New York Times reports that David has written a play called \"Fish in the Dark,\" and will make his Broadway debut starring in it next year. The play is a comedy, naturally, about a death in a family, and David, naturally, will be playing a character much like himself \u2014 as he's long done in Curb Your Enthusiasm. David apparently didn't intend to act in the play but was talked into doing so by producer Scott Rudin. \"I thought it would be pretty cool to write a play someday,\" David tells the Times. \"I didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be pretty cool to be in it.\"\n\"I thought it would be pretty cool to write a play someday.\"\nDavid has been relatively quiet since wrapping up the eighth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm back in 2011. He starred in an HBO movie last year, but David otherwise hasn't been turning out his brand of uncomfortable humor as regularly as he did throughout the 2000s. Fans will reportedly be able to catch him on stage starting March 5th at one of the Shubert theaters, though the specific venue hasn't been named yet. Few other details have been given about the play either, including additional casting \u2014 though the Times is told that Jerry Seinfeld is not involved. Anna D. Shapiro, who won a Tony for August: Osage County, will be directing.\n","Title":"Larry David wrote and is starring in a Broadway play | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
