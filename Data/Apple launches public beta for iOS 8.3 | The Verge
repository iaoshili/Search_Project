{"Main text":"Apple launches public beta for iOS 8.3\nBut not everyone's able to sign up at the moment\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor the first time ever, Apple is inviting regular users to test out an upcoming iOS update. The company has launched a page where interested iPhone owners can sign up to trial iOS 8.3 before it's released to all consumers later this year. Apple's signup page, pictured above, suggests it's gained valuable feedback by running a public beta of OS X on the desktop, and now it's extending the program to cover iOS as well.\n9to5Mac first reported Apple's plans to open up its mobile operating system for wider testing beyond the app developers who typically receive advance access to iOS updates. It's worth nothing that we've so far been unable to access the iOS signup page, so it's unclear if Apple is limiting the beta to randomly selected users; the OS X program was first-come, first-served. Plenty of mentions of iOS are visible in  the FAQ section , though.  The link to sign up is here . If all you see is information on the OS X Yosemite program, you may be out of luck. We've pinged Apple for comment regarding just how it's handling the iOS beta.\nAfter enrolling an iPhone, you'll need to install a package file that clears your device for beta software. Once that's done, presumably you'll be able to install iOS 8.3, which features new emoji, wireless CarPlay, easier logins for Google users, and bug fixes. But keep in mind this is a beta version, so you'll likely run into some glitches and bugs that won't be present in the final version whenever it's released. The current version of iOS, version 8.2, was released after Monday's Apple Watch event and added support for the company's coming wearable.\nVerge Video: Everything you need to know from Apple's Spring Event\n","Title":"Apple launches public beta for iOS 8.3 | The Verge","Tags":["apple","mobile","tech"]}
