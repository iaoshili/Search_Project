{"Main text":"Share: Facebook Twitter\nEvery Simpsons episode ever, as reviewed by you\nThis is a review of every Simpsons episode for the first 25 seasons \u2014 that's 552 episodes in all! We've asked The Verge community to sign up to review up to four episodes of the show each during FXX's 12-day marathon. This is a work in progress \u2014 and because it's a community effort, we expect a few missing episodes here or there (we'll be going to back to fill in the gaps later). Click here for more information. Updated daily!\nSimpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\nHenry T. Casey (@henrytcasey)\nHaving worked out its kinks on The Tracey Ullman Show, The Simpsons arrived fully realized in its solo debut. A perfectly cromulent episode to explain this seminal work to our future one-eyed alien overlords, \"... Fire\" features Homer's lies of omission, Bart's rebellions, and Lisa's precocious intelligence. The family's working class status is truly defined when Homer loses his Mall Santa earnings on a racetrack greyhound named Santa's Little Helper. After declaring that the dog is \"a loser, he's pathetic,\" Homer's rage is broken when Santa's Little Helper licks his face, forcing him to admit: \"He's a Simpson!\"\nEpisode 2\nBart the Genius\nHenry T. Casey (@henrytcasey)\nThe only scripted TV show that came before the modern internet and is still running today, The Simpsons opened its second episode with two proto-memes. Bart's chalkboard gag has made us laugh and helped us mourn, while the family couch has seen everything from The Flintstones To Minecraft.\nBart, having cheated his way into being classified a genius, is transferred to a school for the gifted (no, not Professor X's school). A great episode for Bart's pop culture moments, we get the first \"Eat my Shorts,\" and Scrabble game-winner Kwyjibo.\nEpisode 4\nThere's No Disgrace Like Home\nEden Rohatensky (@edenthecat)\nAfter attending the Nuclear Plants\u2019 company picnic and realizing that his family appears quite dysfunctional in comparison to his colleagues\u2019, Homer decides to sell uses the Simpsons\u2019 menial college fund savings and sells the family\u2019s television so that they can seek counselling from Dr. Marvin Monroe, a family counsellor advertised during boxing matches. Unable to make progress through traditional means, the Simpsons try aversion therapy \u2014 leading them to cause a power overload throughout the city of Springfield by shocking each other repeatedly. As guaranteed, when Dr. Monroe gives up on the family, the money they initially the Simpsons paid is returned in double, allowing them to purchase an upgraded television - seemingly reuniting the family.\nThe episode is an early introduction to the dysfunction within the Simpsons family, a theme that will prevail throughout the series, leading to stories much more charming than this one - but, at least you get to see Marge drunk.\nEpisode 5\nBart the General\nGavin King (@GavinKing13)\nBeginning without a proper intro,\"Bart the General\" is about how Bart Simpson must face Nelson, the stereotypical school bully. With the help of an obsessed war fanatic, Bart is able to train the bullied (through a nostalgic 90s\u2019 montage) to take Nelson down, ending with a \"Happy Birthday\" water balloon bombing. The quirky jokes and relatable problems help remind me of how good cartoons used to be, and that is why I praise this episode. \"There are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy\" (Bart Simpson).\nEpisode 6\nMoaning Lisa\nGavin King (@GavinKing13)\n\"Moaning Lisa\" is a very deep episode, emotionally deeper than any other cartoon would go. Following a small series of sad events, Lisa Simpson becomes depressed; she gives away her last cupcake, her band teacher tells her to follow the music, she is stolen from meeting a saxaphone-genius. Lisa eventually realizes that no one should tell you who to be, and that being someone you\u2019re not will only please others. It is unfortunate that The Simpsons has lost this feel, sucumbing to the humor of shows like Family Guy and South Park (although I enjoy those). Overall, a touching episode.\nEpisode 7\nThe Call of the Simpsons\nCory Anotado (@pacdude)\nThe Call of the Simpsons is a product of its time: the first-season-sitcom trope of the family going on a camping trip and a parody of the myriad of Bigfoot specials FOX was airing at the time. Watching Homer try to finance an RV was hilarious, and watching Maggie raised by a pack of considerate (and intelligent) bears will always elicit awwws, but the rest of the episode felt like a list of what could go wrong on a camping trip, ticked off one by one. Homer as Bigfoot never really landed. Albert Brooks appears, somewhat anonymously, as Cowboy Bob.\nEpisode 8\nThe Telltale Head\nCory Anotado (@pacdude)\nBart, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph stare at the sky and try to make out shapes in clouds. It's an apt metaphor for watching early Simpsons episodes. As the boys spot flaming school buses and a headless statue, so can one see the sparkles of genius that would come in later episodes. The majority of the episode is told in flashbacks: interesting. The entire town coming together as an angry mob over a desecrated statue: great way to set up how foolish and impulsive Springfield really is. As a story, it's harmless and enjoyable. As a harbinger of future episodes, it's exciting.\nEpisode 9\nLife on the Fast Lane\nCory Anotado (@pacdude)\nI dare say that Life on the Fast Lane is the season's best episode. (Not exactly a controversial view, considering it won an Emmy.) I enjoy that it's a Marge-centric episode, and that it reveals more of her personality. Albert Brooks, in his second guest appearance, is hilarious as a French bowling master-cum-casanova, improvising most of his lines in a masterful performance. It ends with Marge choosing Homer over Jacques, and a memorable Officer and a Gentleman parody that I remember seeing and not getting the reference as a child. Overall? Peak of the season.\nEpisode 10\nHomer's Night Out\nCory Anotado (@pacdude)\nNever forget: Homer Simpson is not a bad man. He is stupid, short-sighted, dense, and sometimes inconsiderate. But he is not a bad man. Homer's Night Out is one of those classic examples of this. Despite Homer's hedonism, he knows that the right thing to do is to smooth things over with his wife and set the best example for his kids. And at the end of the day, that's exactly what he does, in classic Homer manner. Even though the episode ends with a cheesy ending, it's a reminder that Homer will always be a good guy.\nEpisode 11\nThe Crêpes of Wrath\nRokorre (@rokorre)\nA great episode that shows the charm of the first few seasons of the Simpsons.  The writing in this episode is amazing showing Homer care for a child that actually seems to respect him.  It's not one of the most memorable episode for a lot of people but it really does show the heart of the show. This episode really shows that the Simpsons writers can do when they take news stories or popular media and use it to push their plot along.\nAlt. take from Joshua Burke (@jemcinema)\nThis episode had me laughing, and it was a great way to wake up. Funny jokes from cast like usual, it was a good episode.\nEpisode 12\nKrusty Gets Busted\nRokorre (@rokorre)\nSideShow Bob. That is all you need to know about this episode.  Here we get the first of a mostly annual side show bob treat when sideshow bob tries to take out someone from springfield.  We also see the beginning of bart and lisa working together to solve a problem in the town, and this is a trope that the show will cary with it all the way to current seasons.  This is one of the most important episodes in the first few seasons that still effects the current shows being produced.\nAlt. take from Joshua Burke (@jemcinema)\nKrusty being one of my favorite characters, I loved this episode because of him. The rest of the cast was good too, but Krusty really stood out in this episode.\nEpisode 13\nSome Enchanted Evening\nBryce Seifert (@bryceseifert)\nIn the season one finale, Homer is treating Marge to an extravagant night out while Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are left in the hands of what turns out to be the infamous Babysitter Bandit. In its first season the show was still, like Maggie in this episode, learning to walk. Also like Maggie, they stumbled quite a bit. Plenty of throwaway gags just don't land, and the Homer and Marge plot feels superfluous and lazy compared to the hilarious, fast-paced antics between the kids and their babysitter-turned-robber. Homer says the Simpsons are a \"quite misunderstood and underrated family.\" Although that may have been true at first, I\u2019d say after they worked out this season\u2019s kinks, they went on to do just fine.\nSeason 2\nOh Bart Simpson, why do you not care?\nYou have failed yet another test\nAnd now you must suffer a scare\nYou treat school in a manner of jest\nIf you fail once more you\u2019ll be held back\nAsk Nelson to tutor you to help you out\nIt\u2019s time to study and get back on track\nNo matter how much you groan and pout\nYou\u2019re going to have to go to school\nHey look! It\u2019s a snow day; just as you prayed\nBut you still have to take that test, not cool\nBy some miracle you pass the test!\nSee what happens when you give things your best?\nEpisode 15\nSimpson and Delilah\nRicky Marin (@cartidge101)\nThe episode starts out with Homer freaking out with a new hair product on TV. It's a \"Miracle Breakthrough.\" Homer then goes to check it out at the doctors. He gets it by charging it to Mr. Burns' insurance for the nuclear plant by lying. It actually works, and he has a full set of hair. Homer then gets a haircut. Mr. Burns gives him a promotion, and he has to leave. Everything is going right for Homer as he has a better relationship with Marge, and Mr. Burns loves him. Smithers is jealous, and finds out about the fake insurance claim. Carl then covers for Homer, and gets fired. Homer loses his hair, due to Bart. Karl prepares a speech for Homer, but it fails due to Homer's lack of hair. Mr. Burns does not fire him, though, and demotes him to his old job.\nEpisode 16\nTreehouse of Horror\nRicky Marin (@cartidge101)\nIt's Halloween night in Springfield, and Bart is giving a story. The family just moved in to a \"cursed house\" and strange things are  happening in the house. They decide to \"sleep on it\". The house tells everyone that everyone is against each other, and they all get weapons. Marge stops it, and decides to leave with the kids. Everyone decides to talk to the house, and the house decides to destroy itself than live with the Simpsons. Aliens arrive, and abduct the family. They are greeted by aliens and eventually leave after playing games.\nEpisode 17\nTwo Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish\nClint (@clint_williams)\nChalkboard: \"I will not Xerox my butt\".\nHarry Shearer had not quite perfected Mr. Burns voice yet - getting there but not yet. Animation was definitely unpolished. Character bodies are silly-putty looking compared to today's look.\nAfter Bart catches a 3-eyed fish and the nuclear plant Homer works at is threatened with a shutdown - Mr. Burns decides to run for governor instead of fixing the plant. His campaign is immoral to Lisa & Marge. Burns' comeuppance occurs when Marge serves him said 3-eyed fish for dinner the eve before the election.\nEpisode 18\nClint (@clint_williams)\nChalkboard: \"I will not trade pants with others.\"\n\"I think I could actually hear the air being torn, sir\" Smithers panders after Burns piffs the first pitch.\nHomer, after getting drunk with Mr. Burns, becomes a minor-league baseball mascot. And gets called \"up\". The atmosphere and slightly darker writing and almost film noir framing sequence is most excellent. The pop-culture references are spot on. The riffing of Lou Gehrig's speech  (right in the middle of all the ALS Challenges when this is airing in 2014) is almost chilling (pun intended).\nBut best of all \u2014 it has Dancin' freakin' Homer, man.\nEpisode 19\nDead Putting Society\nRichard Stanford (@ristanford)\nA sensitive Homer starts a war with his neighbor Ned Flanders. This forces the kids, Bart and Scott, to make a miniature golf tournament into something much more. Luckily for Bart, Lisa (doing her best Mr. Miyagi impersonation), is able to train him in the ways of zen to help him empty his mind from the pressure that Homer brings.\n\"Dead Putting Society\" gives viewers a real introduction to the Flander\/Simpson relationship. It also gives viewers the pop culture references that they have come to love from the Simpsons. All in all, \"Dead Putting Society\" is a great episode.\nEpisode 20\nBart vs. Thanksgiving\nRichard Stanford (@ristanford)\nAfter accidentally throwing Lisa\u2019s centerpiece into the fireplace, Bart leaves home convinced that he has done nothing wrong and that he ruined Thanksgiving. His time on the street offers some potent social commentary on how poorly the homeless are treated mere seconds after receiving their holiday meal.\nOnce back home, Bart and Lisa are able to solidify their relationship. The scene on the roof helps clear up why they were having trouble in the first place. It\u2019s an issue that anyone with a sibling can understand, they just don\u2019t understand each other.\nEpisode 21\nBart the Daredevil\nMichelle Buchman (@michelledeidre)\nTruck-a-saurus! The family attend Lisa's music recital before dashing off to attend a one night only monster truck rally. They drive right into the show where the dino truck crushes their car. Bart dreams of becoming the next big thing after seeing superstar daredevil Lance Murdock leap over a tank of water filled with deadly sharks (and a lion?) The next day, he attempts to jump a car with his skateboard and ends up getting stitches. After recovering Bart sets his sights on a real challenge: Springfield Gorge. Homer meets him at the top and makes him promise not to jump, but ends up sliding down Bart's skateboard and falls down below. Instead of Bart, it's now Homer sitting in a hospital bed next to Lance Murdock. Hey, at least Bart kept his promise?\nEpisode 22\nItchy & Scratchy & Marge\nMichelle Buchman (@michelledeidre)\nMaggie attacks Homer with a mallet. Marge wonders what could have made her act out when she catches \"The Itchy and Scratchy Show\" on TV. She resolves that cartoons must be the reason for violent behavior. Marge writes a letter to the network only to be told to buzz off. Determined, she pickets outside the network. Marge appears on a talk show to debate execs and urges other parents to write in to the network. Under pressure, the cartoon is changed into a cheerful version of itself. Other parents urge Marge to protest against Michelangelo's 'David' coming to town. She refuses, calling it a masterpiece. Pro-cartoon folks call her out, and she admits it's wrong to censors one art form but not another. Marge visits the statue, lamenting the lack of others there when Homer reminds her the kids are being forced to see it on a field trip. Marge cheers up and seems hopeful for the future.\nEpisode 23\nBart Gets Hit by a Car\nRichard Stanford (@ristanford)\nHomer\u2019s gullibility leads him into a shoddy deal with an injury chasing attorney. A story of he said she said, \"Bart Get\u2019s Hit By A Car\" is blatant about the goals of the characters trying to get one over on the Simpsons. Of course, this is why it\u2019s funny.\nBy the end, this episode takes one of the darkest routes I could possible imagine for a Simpsons episode. It\u2019s played off well enough though. The second you see Homer contemplating grabbing his drink you know how everything is going to end.\nEpisode 24\nOne Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\nRichard Stanford (@ristanford)\nOn a quest to try something new, the Simpsons go to a sushi restaurant. Homer being Homer, he falls in love with everything on the menu. That is when he decides it\u2019s time to try Fugu. The inept apprentice is left to cut the dangerous fish while the chef busies himself with Edna Krabappel.\nThis episode is filled with a lot of fun moments such as Bart and Lisa singing the Shaft theme and Homer making amends with his father. It also touches on an important life topic. Knocking goals of your bucket list.\nEpisode 25\nThe Way We Was\nDmitry Terner\nWhen the TV goes on the fritz we get our first ever Simpsons flashback. It's the story of Homer and Marge and may be one of the sweetest episodes the show has ever done. We learn that they got married because Marge got knocked up but that is a story for another day. We meet lovable high school loser Homer with a thick head of hair. We meet a smart and engaged Marge who falls for Homers simple charms and sees that a kind man is more important than a smart one. We all melt when Homer invites her to the prom and she says that she will wear her hair up.\nEpisode 26\nHomer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment\nDmitry Terner\nWhen Homer decides to steal cable all is great until Lisa gets a terrifying lesson on Hell in Sunday school. This episode is firmly in the oeuvre of Lisa being a giant stick in the mud. When everyone in town without a cable subscription gathers at the Simpsons to watch the big fight, Homer sees the toll it has taken on his family. Lisa losing respect for him, Bart charging the neighborhood kids to watch the adult channel and Marge concerned about both those developments. He joins them outside; \"Dad we may have just saved your soul\" says Lisa  \"At the worst possible time\" replies Homer.\nEpisode 27\nCamilla Ice (@moviegalcamille)\nHomer x Marge = Patty + Seymour - Selma\nThis feel-good episode is more cute than funny. Homer tries to hook up Selma with Principal Skinner, but Seymour falls for Patty instead. Highlights include Bart's prank call to Moe's (Homer Sexual), and Homer's Terminator \"man vision.\"\nEpisode 28\nOh Brother, Where Art Thou?\nCamilla Ice (@moviegalcamille)\n(Homer's mom + Carny) \/ Grampa = Homer + Herb\nClassic Grampa Simpson, classic Homer... classic episode. Homer reunites with his long-lost brother Herb and tries to support his failing car company. Highlights are a clip from a McBane movie, the reveal of The Homer, and Danny Devito guest starring as Herb.\nEpisode 29\nBart's Dog Gets an \"F\"\nBrandon\nIn a remix of the first episode in season 2 \"Bart Gets an F\", this time around the topic of failure is Santa's Little Helper. My dog is basically Santa\u2019s Little Helper Jr. so I have experience in this realm. SLH destroys Homers new sneakers and even the Bouvier family quilt! There are no words. Homer and Marge want to give him away for his misbehavior, but luckily he eventually passes obedience class\u2026and subsequently bites Bart. This episode is a great reminder that although our pets may drive us insane from time to time, we could never imagine life without them.\nEpisode 30\nOld Money\nBrandon\nGrampa catches the love bug after mixing up prescription meds with the beautiful Beatrice Simmons. Ready to go big on her birthday, Abe ends up missing it (stuck with the family at a safari overnight, surrounded by Zebra murdering lions) and Beatrice passes away. She leaves a large inheritance to him and he eventually decides to live the geriatric dream and increase the sum by gambling. Homer saves him from betting it all away and Grampa, looking to improve the lives of his friends, uses the cash to upgrade the Springfield retirement home. He also buys Napoleon\u2019s (fake) fez hat.\nEpisode 31\nBrush With Greatness\nGreg Mooney (@extremeradical)\nIt's easy to look at the two plots in this episode and identify a theme: persistence. Marge and Homer both revisit their own lost causes. This wouldn't be interesting on it's own, but for the fact the main character is Marge, who has never enjoyed as much limelight as Homer, Bart, or Lisa.\nThis wasn't the best episode in season two, (in fact, it immediately precedes it) but it still has a several standout lines, and a great ending.\nThe whole \"Will you take us to Mt. Splashmore?\" bit.\n\"As God as my witness, I'll always be hungry again!\"\nAnd, of course, pretty much any line from Mr. Lombard, the overly complementary art teacher.\nEpisode 32\nLisa's Substitute\nGreg Mooney (@extremeradical)\nWatching this episode again took me back to a simpler time. When Simpsons episodes were about a blue collar family with relatable problems.\nThe stories themselves are about nerds. Bart's political rival, Martin Prince, and Lisa and her temporary mentor, father figure, and unrequited crush, Mr. Bergstrom.\nClearly, Homer and Bart deserve each other. They're able to spend quality time together in the B plot. In the A plot, Homer and Lisa drift apart.\nThe conclusion is so poignant, I think, because Homer figures that out. He won't be able to challenge Lisa intellectually. He's neither smart nor charming. But he apologizes as best he can, because nothing is more important to him than his family.\nEpisode 33\nThe War of The Simpsons\nDan Reid (@danreid)\nThis episode covered a lot of bases for so early in the series for me. Tackling marriage problems, the kids taking advantage of grandpa, and had so many stylistic garnishes on certain scenes (\"So I said I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini\"). I also enjoy the classic touch of the penciled on beer stubble on Homer often utilized to present him as disheveled. This episode starts strong but falls downhill, but that's bound to happen after one of the best rant's in the series \"Yoooooou stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks!! I quit!\"\nEpisode 34\nThree Men and a Comic Book\nDan Reid (@danreid)\nThis episode was our first glimpse at 90s dance mogul Bartman (who most people today probably don't remember and thus he still pays full price). The Wonder Years bit in this ep always puts a smile on my face. As with the episode before so many great stylistic cues with Comic Book Guy's maniacal laugh to the boys wrestling by the light of thunder and lightning in the treehouse (they're fine). I can only hope grown up versions of the boys are pooling their cash together and are bidding on the perfect Action Comics #1.\nA+ Episode\nBlood Feud\nJonathan Johnson (@jonolafjohnson)\nBart saves Mr. Burns\u2019s life thanks to his rare blood type. Stingy as always, Burns gives only a simple Thank You card, sending Homer into indignant rage. At its core this is an episode about synergetic relationships; both Homer and Burns rely upon morally stable characters (Marge and Smithers, respectively) to navigate important and difficult ethical decisions. The episode, however, never feels heavy-handed, and is rich with some top-drawer moments: Lisa\u2019s attempts to decolonize Maggie\u2019s education, an amazing Springfield Post Office mural, the first appearance of Will There Ever Be a Rainbow, and Homer\u2019s bafflingly confused rendition of Androcles and the Lion. To top it off, Blood Feud ends with a classic bit of Simpsonian meta-fiction and moral untidiness:\nLisa: \"Perhaps there is no moral to this story.\"\nHomer: \"Exactly! Just a bunch of stuff that happened!\"\n8 Xtapolapocetls out of 10\nSeason 3\nStark Raving Dad\nJonathan Johnson (@jonolafjohnson)\nPersecuted as a \"free-thinking anarchist\" by Burns after a laundry accident, Homer is admitted to a mental institution, where he bunks with a patient who may or may not be Michael Jackson. The episode was initially steeped in mystery: MJ\u2019s performance was originally accredited to \"Johnny Jay Smith.\" MJ\u2019s performance is a good one, but the episode never relies too heavily on celebrity. Highlights include Bart\u2019s hilariously disturbing fantasy of a lobotomized Homer, a jab at the then-popular \"America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\" (\"Man breaking hip!\"), Homer\u2019s inability to grasp the realities of agoraphobia, and two actually-pretty-good original MJ tunes (which were performed by an MJ impersonator). The third act is a little undercooked, and the conclusion feels unsatisfying and tacked-on, but for the most part this episode stands up well to millennial scrutiny.\n7 Insane stamps out of 10.\nEpisode 37\nMr. Lisa Goes to Washington\nBenny Zheng\nAs the title suggest, this episode is primarily a satire on American politics and the political system. Needless to say, with a topic that\u2019s smorgasbord of potential material, the writers went to town with this episode. Though according to Wikipedia, the logging industry had an issue with this one. As someone who is involved in the political scene, I thoroughly enjoyed this episode.\nBest Line: \"There\u2019s been a problem at the essay contest! A little girl is losing faith in democracy!\" \"Oh No!\"\nMost unrealistic moment: When voting for the bill to expel the corrupt senator, the speaker says \"maybe we should tack on a wage increase for ourselves\", and all the other senators yell \"NO\"; yeah, that s* would never happen in real life\nEpisode 38\nWhen Flanders Failed\nBenny Zheng\nThe one where Ned Flanders opens a store specifically for left handed people. This episode really shows the complexity of the characters because even though Homer hates Ned, he still ends up helping Ned when Ned was in the dumps. To be honest I wasn\u2019t really a big fan of this episode. Especially that song at the end. Too happy. Especially at 5am on Friday morning.\nBest Line: \"I don\u2019t care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he\u2019s a jerk!\"\nMost unrealistic moment: There\u2019s like 20 left-handed people in Springfield. Most of us couldn\u2019t name 3.\nEpisode 39\nRyan Maffei\nSeason 3 is a structural leap, stronger plots more inventively presented (this one\u2019s first act foreshadows the heyday\u2019s where-is-this-all-going windups). But since the tightening precedes the evolution of the gag-saturated next years, the jokes neither jolt like in season 2 nor sweep you up in sustained wit like 7 and 8. Dry winners directly anticipate scene breaks or thudding resolutions. This mob-themer lacks the \u2018Homie the Clown\u2019\u2019s gonzo ebullience (clears the Godfather groaners out of the way at least) yet offers a few bejeweled bullets: Bart singing \"It\u2019s Witchcraft\", Neil Patrick Harris, and an incredible denouement, all blissful Swartzweldian randomness.\nEpisode 40\nRyan Maffei\nThis episode, which tests the waters of emotionalizing Homer the \"Project Bootsrap\" power plant drone, is sharper and zippier, with never-fail Jon Lovitz, perfect-delivery Magic Johnson, and a slew of terrific moments (\"call me Mr. Devereaux\"; \"this reporter promises to be more trusting and less vigilant in the future\"; \"I get enough admiration and respect at work, I don\u2019t need any at home!\"). Add to that some season-typical Burns & Smithers gold and a weaker subplot is justified, though stuff like the visual-gag debut of Milhouse\u2019s mother makes one wish for the impact of seeing all this when it aired.\nEpisode 41\nLike Father, Like Clown\nBob Timmermann (@bobtimmermann)\nWe all knew by this time that Krusty was a troubled man, but in this episode we were introduced to another cause of Krusty's pain: his estrangement with his father, Hyman, a rabbi voiced by Jackie Mason.\nThe show actually credited two rabbis as technical advisers, which no doubt helped with the authenticity of Bart and Lisa's attempts to reunite the Krustofskys. Although one is left wondering if the rabbis found the key Sammy Davis, Jr. quote that softened the heart of his father. Because the Talmud certainly didn't work.\nEpisode 42\nTreehouse of Horror II\nBob Timmermann (@bobtimmermann)\nThe first Treehouse of Horror was a classic, but the second one was a lesser effort.  All of the stories are supposed to be scary dreams caused by excessive Halloween candy consumption. But, all of them lack signature lines and scenes, which may be the scariest thing of all.\nThere is a monkey's paw that grants wishes but only with grave misfortune, a parody of the \"It's a Good Life\" from the \"Twilight Zone\" with a few yuks, and finally the best part of the episode, watching Mr. Burns with Homer's brain on his head pretending to be Davy Crockett.\nEpisode 43\nLisa's Pony\nPedram Mobedi (@gxhxoxsxtxfxm)\nHomer's hilarious naivete can occasionally be misleading. But Lisa, being Springfield's most normal citizen evokes an emotional side of Homer when she puts him in a moral dilemma. She asks for a saxophone reed. But upon Homer's failure to fulfill her affordable request, he has to choose between working a second job at Apu's or tolerate the burden of a disappointed Lisa. He opts for the former. This is another fine display of family values and an early example of fast-paced humor that only Al Jean and Mike Reiss could have written for a 1991 animated sitcom.\nEpisode 44\nSaturdays of Thunder\nPedram Mobedi (@gxhxoxsxtxfxm)\nA soapbox race becomes another daunting challenge for Homer. To make Bart happy, he should find a craftsmanship that is not surprisingly absent in his nature and will, halfway through the episode, lead to their embarrassment. But such an adventurous comeback from failure to success costs a densely written script that can eventually distract the viewer from the shore the story is supposed to reach. This is an amalgam of motivation, despair, fatherhood and victory lust that can be digested with typical expected Simpsons wit outsmarting us using a roller coaster ride of events that could have easily derailed us otherwise.\nEpisode 46\nBurns Verkaufen Der Kraftwerk\nJames Park\nThe episode opens with a wistful Mr. Burns reminiscing of childhood (\"I dreamed of grand slam home runs and wiping out nations with the stroke of a pen...\") and later selling the power plant. As the new German owners fire Homer in true German fashion (in alphabetical order!), Burns's futile search for fulfillment without the plant leads to an epic confrontation between a desperate to buy Burns and the desperate to sell Germans.\nClassic bits include The Land of Chocolate and Evil Beekeeper Burns (the queen is named Smithers!). And lest we forget: Germans are not all smiles und sunshine.\nEpisode 47\nI Married Marge\nBryce Seifert (@bryceseifert)\nA pregnancy scare sends Homer on a Supertramp fueled flashback detour to the story of wooing Marge. In an oddly sentimental outing, this Simpsons plays ping pong between sappy and comedy, with almost every \"aww\" moment immediately punctuated with a punchline from Homer. Its flashback nature also yields the classic scene where Homer ruins the twist of Empire Strikes Back while leaving the theater. It has all the pieces of a great episode, even if they are unwound at a pace that\u2019s a tad slow. But hey, I won\u2019t be too critical. Like Homer says in this episode: \"don\u2019t you ever, ever talk that way about television.\"\nEpisode 48\nRadio Bart\nBryce Seifert (@bryceseifert)\nStarting with a broken-on-the-spot promise made by Bart to not pull any pranks with the new AM radio microphone gifted to him by Homer, this episode follows his hijinks as they escalate in both deviousness and hilarity. Eventually, Springfield is trying to save a \u2018boy trapped in a well\u2019 (voiced by Bart via his radio) while Sting and Krusty record a version of \"We Are The World\" about sending love down a well. The resulting chaos delivers a near-perfect satire of news media, how we cope with tragedy, and Sting. Its swift, joke to joke precision is the way you would expect a classic Simpsons to flow, and it makes for an endlessly enjoyable watch.\nEpisode 49\nCindy Claussen\nThis Lisa-centric episode sees Lisa trying to connect with Homer by watching football with him and she has a knack for picking the winning team. Homer places bets on Lisa\u2019s picks and has a winning streak. Lisa has a terrible dream about what her future would be like if she kept on gambling. Lisa realizes Homer\u2019s affection for her is dependent on providing the winning picks. She denounces gambling, and asks him not to bet on the Superbowl. Homer realizes that he needs to spend time with her outside of football. They go on a hike together the following Sunday.\nEpisode 50\nCindy Claussen\nChalkboard: I will not spank others.\nMarge is feeling under appreciated and overworked. She takes a spa vacation away by herself at Rancho Relaxo. Homer is inept caring for Maggie alone. Bart and Lisa go to spend time with Patty and Selma. The family is so thankful to have Marge back after the vacation, but Marge reminds them to be more appreciative of her in the future. You get the sense that Marge missed the family a lot, despite their needy behavior and they will soon forget the lesson they learned from Marge\u2019s absence.\nEpisode 51\nBart the Lover\nAdvait Panchal (@LifeDigita)\nI tend to think as time moves on a show starts degrading, but that can not be said about 'The Simpsons' rather than being a straightforward comedy series the show is filled with the kind of humor which basically coincides with our real world experiences. I won't say that like how in this episode Bart faked writing love letters to his Teacher is what people do in the real world but c'mon Tinder.\nThe funniest part of the series was something to do with flanders, well keeping spoilers to minimum I would say that it was funny as it should be.\nEpisode 52\nHomer at the Bat\nAdvait Panchal (@LifeDigita)\nSarcasm is one of the key types of humor you would find in The Simpsons and this episode just has a bunch of awesome jokes. Keeping spoilers to minimum I think this was one of the best Baseball themed Simpsons episode ever featuring many Major League Baseball players.\nBasically Springfield Nuclear Power Plant sign up for some sort of a league where various power plant teams battle against each other but its about Homer here, so there must be some weird, right? Absolutely! he has this bat which he calls as the wonderbat and how the story unfolds is hilarious. BTW the ending is just awesome!\nEpisode 53\nSeparate Vocations\nAndrew Deniszczyc (@adeniszczyc)\nAfter taking career aptitude tests, Lisa's dreams of becoming a jazz musician are shattered, while Bart is destined to be police officer. After riding with the police, featuring car chases, gun shootouts, and Apu getting tied up in \"nylon rope...[which] feels so smooth against [his] skin\", Bart decides to get a taste of the authority as a hall monitor. With crushed dreams, Lisa turns to rebellion, (nearly) smoking, telling the teacher to \"shove it\" and even hiding the \"Teacher's Editions. The unexpected reversal of morals between Bart and Lisa, with constant underlying humour, make this fine episode.\nEpisode 54\nDog of Death\nAndrew Deniszczyc (@adeniszczyc)\nIn a tough decision, the Simpsons must decide whether they can pay for an operation to save Santa's Little Helper. After failing to win the lottery, the Simpsons agree to lifestyle sacrifices, saving the dog. These changes soon result in bitterness in the family, causing the dog to run away. This leads him to Mr Burns who trains him to become an attack dog, through the Ludovico technique from Clockwork Orange. At times, an emotional episode with scenes of conflict between father and son as well as the underlying theme that keeping a family pet is worth any price.\nEpisode 55\nColonel Homer\nAndrew Janke (@AndrewJanke)\nAww. The simple hand-drawn cel animation in this feels charming and comfortable, like a childhood home.\nA musical episode! Three original songs, cute and well sung. And twenty solid minutes of little jokes and sight gags, the pace was rolling along but not breakneck.\nNice to see some of what makes Marge and Homer work as a couple and how Homer feels about that. A really good episode. Every minute had something funny or human in it.\nEpisode 56\nBlack Widower\nAndrew Janke (@AndrewJanke)\nWell, that was... okay. Kind of a letdown after last episode's dense concentration of high quality jokes. This one wasn't very funny; the few gags were more allusion than humor.\nThis one didn't really land for me. Maybe it's because as an adult, Sideshow Bob seems like such a two-dimensional character to me, compared to the rest of the Simpsons cast, and especially the other villain types like Mr. Burns.\nEpisode 57\nThe Otto Show\nBryce Seifert (@bryceseifert)\nOtto is suspended after he crashes the school bus, which he reveals he doesn\u2019t actually have the license to drive. This stems from the funniest moment in this episode, where Bart encourages Otto to play guitar, and he rocks Free Bird for a stopped bus full of school children while traffic builds behind them. The amount of characters on the show besides the actual family is unfathomable, and it is always interesting to put the weight of an episode on a more minor character. Otto proves to be a great platform to do this, and his care-free attitude paired with both characters like him (Bart, Homer) and authority figures (Marge, Principal Skinner) lead to a great episode.\nEpisode 59\nBrother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?\nEden Rohatensky (@edenthecat)\nThe introduction and the build to the main plot line of the story is somewhat confusing and disjointed and had me questioning what exactly was happening. Yet, the story of how Homer and his half-brother Herb (excellently voiced by Danny DeVito) are reunited indirectly by Homer's radiation-caused sterility and Mr. Burns' insatiable desire to protect his wealth leads to a rather heart-warming tale.\nThere was noticeably a lack of memorable jokes or gags, but there was a scene where Moe's regulars are drunkenly gambling on a race between Marge's recently retired washer and dryer, which had me in a small fit of giggles.\nEpisode 58\nBart's Friend Falls in Love\nEden Rohatensky (@edenthecat)\nAfter a Magic 8-ball predicts that their friendship will end, Bart and Milhouse are faced with the ever-so-real killer of hanging out: romance. Milhouse meets Samantha Stank, a new transfer student at their school, and the two of them instantly fall in love. Bart, resentful and bored once Milhouse is occupied by kissing Samantha \u2014 tattles to Samantha\u2019s father, resulting in her being sent off to an all-girls school. Milhouse is heartbroken.\nHomer, speaking in near-gibberish after expanding his vocabulary subliminally in an attempt to lose weight, can provide no advice to a guilt-ridden Bart. Taking Lisa\u2019s advice instead, Bar confesses to Milhouse and apologizes to Samantha.\nMilhouse goes to visit Samantha, who does not want to leave her new school, but kisses him though it violates the school policy. Way to go, Milhouse!\nSeason 4\nKamp Krusty\nEden Rohatensky (@edenthecat)\nAfter much anticipation, Bart and Lisa are sent to Kamp Krusty only to realize that it's completely dilapidated and that Krusty is unlikely to make an appearance. Meanwhile, charmingly, Homer and Marge are able to seemingly grow some sort of a semblance of a stable and healthy relationship.\n\"I've been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together\" announces Kent Brockman.\nStarved, thirsty, and with a broken spirit, Bart begins a rebellion within the camp - leading Krusty to come try to smooth things over by taking the children at the camp to Tijuana.\nSometimes I wish I had the Simpsons' childhood.\nEpisode 61\nA Streetcar Named Marge\nChase D. Troutner (@Captain_Strongo)\n\"A Streetcar Named Marge\" didn\u2019t feature a lot of laugh-out-loud gags, but showcased the subtle humor that characterized the shows early years (for example, the numerous Ayn Rand references in an episode centered around a Tennessee Williams play). However, the episode does feature a genuinely touching moment as Homer realizes he has more in common with the play\u2019s Stanley than he\u2019d like, and ends with a heart-felt apology. Moments like that separate The Simpsons from other sitcoms.\nFavorite Moment: Maggie\u2019s The Great Escape homage (complete with Elmer Bernstein score!) to breach the pacifier storage locker.\nEpisode 62\nHomer the Heretic\nChase D. Troutner (@Captain_Strongo)\n\"Homer the Heretic\" is bookended by Homer skipping church on two separate Sundays, with two very different outcomes. In the end, Homer comes to value his faith. It\u2019s a story we\u2019d be unlikely to see in modern American sitcoms, where religion is rarely mentioned, except as the butt of a joke. To top it off, the episode is very funny, with such famous moments as Homer\u2019s \"Out of This World Moon Waffles\" (I may try my hand at those).\nFavorite Moment: Flanders\u2019 attempt to rescue Homer by tossing him through the window onto a mattress. It\u2026 doesn\u2019t go as expected.\nEpisode 63\nThe Simpsons gather in the living room to tell scary tales\nGrampa wetting his pants never fails\nHomer buys a Krusty doll to Bart\u2019s delight\nLittle does Homer know that he\u2019s in for a fright\nThe Krusty doll is evil and tries to kill\nKing Homer is a giant ape on the loose\nMr. Burns and Smithers make a truce\nKing Homer eats a lot of people\nBart discovers a magic book and tries to revive Snowball the cat\nHe raises the dead and Barney chews on some zombie fat\nBart finds the right book to fix his error\nTreehouse of Horror III, what a terror\nEpisode 65\nItchy and Scratchy: The Movie\nKarim Mourad (@ratmfoo)\nBart! Why are you such a bad kid?\nYou\u2019re driving Homer and Marge mad\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe the terrible things Bart did\nMarge seriously worries this isn\u2019t a fad\nHomer tries to lay down the law\nBut he doesn\u2019t care\nBart cuts right through his act like a saw\nUntil Bart does something not fair\nThus, he is barred from watching the new Itchy and Scratchy film\nEpisode 66\nSo Marge works at Mr. Burns\u2019 plant\nMr. Burns falls in love\nEpisode 67\nNew Kid on the Block\nScott Jenkins (@sej326)\nThe episode begins with a parody of '90s dating show \"Studs,\" setting things up for the main storyline in which Bart falls for new neighbor Laura. After finding out that she has fallen for bully Jimbo, Bart intends to end that.\nThe more entertaining storyline is Homer being kicked out of ``all-you-can-eat\" seafood restaurant The Frying Dutchman before he has had his fill. That leads him to hire the great Lionel Hutz to sue the restaurant for false advertising.\nA classic boy-meets-girl story, the episode is fine for what it is, but the love stories are never among my favorites.\nEpisode 68\nMr. Plow\nScott Jenkins (@sej326)\nThis classic episode features Homer buying a plow at an auto show after smashing his car when driving home from Moe's in a snowstorm. To help pay for the cost, he starts a plowing business, Mr. Plow, which is successful until Barney starts his own company, Plow King, and steals most of Homer's customers, causing a competition between the two. Trying to beat Barney, Homer convinces him to plow a mountain, where he gets covered in an avalanche.\nOther than guest spots by Linda Ronstadt and Adam West, this episode features a realistic story, which is the show at its best.\nEpisode 69\nLisa's First Word\nMelinda Greene (@mowinda)\nMarge worries about Maggie\u2019s language development and reveals the story of Lisa\u2019s first word. We see the young Simpsons living tenement style on the lower east side of Springfield with toddler Bart, who spends his days getting into mischief set to the tune of \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" Lisa is born and Bart steadfastly tries to murder her until she says her first word: \"Bart.\" There are so many good things about this episode, a few of which are the phrase \"Can\u2019t sleep, clown will eat me\" and a rogue Grandma Flanders appearance. Oh, and Maggie\u2019s first word? Daddy.\nEpisode 70\nHomer's Triple Bypass\nMelinda Greene (@mowinda)\nWhile stuck in traffic Homer\u2019s heart begins to beat irregularly and he is told he needs an immediate expensive heart surgery. Having given up his insurance for a pinball machine at work Homer has the operation done by everyone\u2019s favorite incompetent physician, Dr. Nick (\"The coroner? I am so sick of that guy.\"). With Lisa\u2019s assistance in the operating theater Homer pulls through. Highlights of this episode are Dr. Nick\u2019s surgery tape cutting to an episode of \"People Who Look Like Things\" and our old friend Mr. McGreg, with a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!\nEpisode 71\nBrett Glisson (@brettglisson)\n- This is one of the best half-hours of the Simpsons ever.\n- The Music Man parody beats out the Flinstones parody. But only by a hair. The fact that they could fit both of them in the same episode and make it work should make Seth MacFarlane ashamed.\n- Anyone can make fun of Star Trek. Only the Simpsons would make fun of Nimoy's \"In Search Of...\" as well.\n- Episodes like this make me really, really miss Phil Hartman.\n- Homer's best line: \"I call the big one Bitey.\"\nEpisode 72\nSelma's Choice\nBrett Glisson (@brettglisson)\n- Not this season's strongest episode by far. But considering it's competition, it's not saying much. Still great, just off pace a bit.\n- Despite the fact that he's a terrible father and a moron, Homer is a fantastic role model for how to keep a healthy relationship with your spouse: lots and lots of sexytimes.\n- Lisa's vision of Selma after drinking the water in the \"Small World\" knockoff is straight out of a Ralph Bakshi fever dream. Yikes.\n- This is about smack-dab the middle of the really, really great episodes.\n- Homer's best line: \"Suggestion Noted.\"\nEpisode 73\nBrother From The Same Planet\nJay Pfeifer (@JayPfeifer_NI)\nThis is a true classic. It\u2019s non-stop funny with absolutely absurd joke pacing. The Lisa \/ 900-number B plot suffers by comparison to the main storyline. Although probably nothing can stand up to the relationship between Pepsi and Papa Homer.\nBut can we talk about that dissolve from the bathtub to the soccer net? Homer's face melting on the way home? Considering how static the Season 1 episodes looked yesterday, this episode shows how far \"The Simpsons\" had evolved and how it would make the most of the possibilities animation offers. Amazing.\nEpisode 74\nI Love Lisa\nJay Pfeifer (@JayPfeifer_NI)\nExceptionally sweet. This is a straight-forward \"Lisa\" episode in which Ralph Wiggum becomes more than just the kid whose cat\u2019s breath smells like cat food. The show dies a little bit after Ralph\u2019s heart is broken at Krusty\u2019s 29th anniversary show \u2013 which, until I rewatched it, I could have sworn came at the end of the episode instead of the halfway point. This episode has to include the most charming use of \"Monster Mash.\" And thanks to this episode, I have called the trunk of my car the \"tunk\" for the past 20-odd years.\nEpisode 75\nDuffless\nPatrick Fisher (@pwkfisher)\nAfter an afternoon of ditching out on work to visit the Duff brewery, Homer gets arrested for driving while drunk, which leads Marge to convince Homer to go sober for thirty days. In the end, it leads to a nice moment between Marge and Homer where he delays his return to alcohol to spend some time together.\nThe secondary story of Lisa treating Bart like a hamster is hilarious. Watching Bart never learn about getting shocked never gets old - just like Sideshow Bob and the rakes.\nFavourite Quote: \"Here\u2019s an appealing fellow! In fact, they\u2019re a-PEEL-ing him off the sidewalk right now!\" \"Haha...it\u2019s funny because I don\u2019t know him\"\nEpisode 76\nCome gather \u2018round childen it\u2019s high time ye learns\nAbout a hero named Homer and a devil named Burns.\nThe dental plan lost for girls and the fellas\nSo they all went on strike; lest they fold like umbrellas.\nFavourite Quote: \"So I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt. Which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Gimme five bees for a quarter, you'd say. Now where was I\u2026\"\nEpisode 79\nWhacking Day\nScott Dwyer (@AlmondJoyJingle)\n\"Whacking Day\", produced by Simpsons titans Conan O\u2019Brien and George Meyer, and containing jokes built on \"monsterism\", \"evil homer\", and perhaps television\u2019s funniest Johnny Tremain reference, is a Simpsons episode whose pointed greatness is exceeded only by the length and complexity of this amateurish sentence. The central conceit of the narrative is a scathing critique of institution, be it government, education, group think, or\u2026sexuality as it pertains to cross dressing burlesque shows for Hitler? One is left to ponder the metaphorical significance of man\u2019s ritual murder of snakes, but is quickly reminded that\u2026hey! Where\u2019s my mountain bike?\nEpisode 80\nMarge in Chains\nScott Dwyer (@AlmondJoyJingle)\n\"Marge in Chains\" is either a fairly mild takedown of Mrs. Lovejoy\u2019s gossiping or an excuse to feature Lionel Hutz (or \"the law talking guy\" as he puts it) in as many scenes as possible. While defending Marge after she steals Kwik-E-Mart brand bourbon, the Simpsons' go-to lawyer confesses to having repeatedly run over the judge\u2019s son, entering the courtroom with no pants, and offering the Simpsons a \"smoking monkey\" (I have no idea what or WHY this is, but I still want one). The episode doesn't have the same teeth other gems in the '93 season had, but the jokes are there. Plus, it features a statue of Jimmy Carter with Marge's hair. So we've got that going for us.\nEpisode 81\nMark Anderson (@EverytimeImark)\nGABBO! GABBO! GABBO!\nThe season 4 finale has Krusty the Klown reeling as his show is cancelled and replaced with ventriloquism act, \"Gabbo\". Krusty fights to get back on air with a comeback special featuring multiple celebrity appearances.\nHighlights were \"Eastern Europe's favorite cat and mouse team\" Worker and Parasite, and Bette Midler's one-liner: \"Time to take out the trash.\" (\"We'll get you Midleerrrrrrrr....\")\nThe episode also gets a little meta with Krusty making jabs at both Fox and the Emmy Awards, something I always found funny in both The Simpsons and Futurama.\nOverall, a great way to end season 4 with one of Krusty's best episodes.\nSeason 5\nHomer's Barbershop Quartet\nMark Anderson (@EverytimeImark)\nThe season 5 premiere has Homer telling the tale of his old barbershop quartet, \"The Be Sharps\" and their number-one hit \"Baby On Board.\"\nPersonally, this episode is one of my favorites because I've always loved barbershop quartets. Plus I'll admit, any episode with a musical number ranks highly in my book, and this one is no exception.\nThis episode was also the second time a member of The Beatles was featured, with George Harrison making a cameo appearance.\nA great opener to Season 5 and an all-around classic episode, Homer's Barbershop Quartet was more than a one-hit wonder.\nEpisode 83\nCape Feare\nMichael Lipkin (@mlipkin)\nI have to admit I\u2019ve never actually seen \"Cape Fear\"\u2014original or reboot\u2014so there are probably a handful of nods that slipped by me. But this is \"The Simpsons\" at its heyday, with a classic Sideshow Bob plot to finally off Bart, complete with the now iconic rake gag. In true low brow\/high brow fashion, the episode has several Gilbert & Sullivan references, including Bart goading Sideshow Bob to perform the entire HMS Pinafore catalog. Sideshow Bob eventually got overused, but here he\u2019s still a sadistic creep who just can\u2019t catch a break.\nEpisode 84\nHomer Goes To College\nMichael Lipkin (@mlipkin)\nThis episode, by Conan O\u2019Brien in one of his last writing credits on the show, gets off to a great start\u2014Homer is so incompetent at his job that he can cause a reactor simulator to meltdown, despite not actually having any fissile material. The solution? Send him to college to act out most Animal House et al. clichés. The story gets a bit same-y for me after that, and I miss the episode\u2019s cleverer gags, like Mr. Burns desperately trying to do his best DeNiro from \"The Untouchables.\" Homer learns to love the campus nerds after giving them a hard time--you know the drill.\nEpisode 85\nDaryl Baxter\nYes. We'll send the eye.'\nIt may be only 20 minutes, but it feels like a feature length movie. We get loss, adventure, reunion, and of course, comedy with no minute spared for a breather. Mr Burns discovers his long lost bear, representing his innocence, when he was a young boy, has returned after its own, 'adventure'.\nI don't need to say anymore on this episode. It's a classic. You've probably seen it a hundred times. And after reading this, the 101st time.\nEnjoy.\nDaryl Baxter\nThree stories, each with heavy influences, and Lionel Hutz.  While Ned Flanders is the devil, which is a perfect choice. The first is about Homer selling his soul for a donut to Ned 'Devil', and then being represented by Lionel Hutz. 'Which is unbreakable!' The second is twist on the famous Twilight Zone episode, where Bart sees a gremlin on the bus, and the last is Mr Burns as Dracula. 'Dad, that's not his heart.' Every moment isn't wasted, with a classic quote you're still saying in casual conversation 20 years on.\nEpisode 87\nJulio Angel Ortiz\nAn episode very much a product of its time. Geraldo, Crystal Pepsi, Doctor Quinn: Medicine Woman, LA Law, and rave references abound (to name just a few), underscored by a riff on \"Thelma and Louise\" featuring Marge. The jokes come subtle and heavy- \"Shot Kickers\" is brilliant, while Chief Wiggum's reference to an accidental homosexual encounter with a blow-up doll is... whoa. The bored housewives and apologetic husbands theme feels tired in this day and age, but the script provides enough punch to keep you engaged the entire time.\nEpisode 88\nJulio Angel Ortiz\nA cryptic Krusty the Clown selling a trampoline, a self-help guru, and a soul-crushing loss of identity: this episode\u2019s commentary on the gullibility of the masses and using absurdity to hold a mirror to our society is still relevant today, even if the methodology isn\u2019t. The episode is a bit of a letdown. Despite some interesting imagery (children strewn about the Simpsons\u2019 backyard like a battlefield) and more creepy jokes (who wants to imagine the Sea Captain masturbating to Marge\u2019s naked sisters?), the episode drowns in its cautionary trappings.\nEpisode 89\nBoy Scoutz N the Hood\nBrandon (@Brandon_McKoy)\nIn a tale about the perils of all-night benders due to slushies composed entirely of syrup, Bart accidentally joins the Junior Campers of which Ned Flanders is the leader. When the time comes to go on a Father\/Son trip, Bart and Homer get along as well as you'd expect. The real star of this episode is the interminable Ernest Borgnine, who mentors a young trooper, leads the rest of the camp troupe through the woods, fights a bear without a knife, and sings songs around a campfire all while wearing a dashing captain's hat in the style of Gilligan.\nEpisode 90\nThe Last Temptation of Homer\nBrandon (@Brandon_McKoy)\nThis classic episode shows something that we never thought was possible - a smoking hot female version of Homer Simpson. When Mindy Simmons shows up at the power plant, Homer can't help but be infatuated with her. He does everything he can to avoid her but despite his efforts, Mr. Burns sends them to Capital City together to represent the plant. At the behest of a prescient fortune cookie, Homer accepts his fate and prepares to get down to business with Mindy, who assures him that they don't have. Good thing, as Homer and Marge stay together and get it on.\nEpisode 91\n$pringfield (or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)\nA.J. Kueterman\nThis episode is as golden as the streets in old time Springfield, a city \"on the grow!\" But when the modern town finds themselves on tough times, even stick in the mud Marge can agree to overlook the moral issues of gambling to allow the construction of a new casino in town, which of course leads to a whole array of issues including Marge\u2019s compulsive gambling addiction. The laughs come at breakneck speed in this episode from the meat of The Simpsons glory years. The obvious 2001: A Space Odyssey reference involving Mr. Burns validates the episode\u2019s lengthy subtitle.\nEpisode 92\nHomer the Vigilante\nA.J. Kueterman\nA nefarious cat burglar has been terrorizing the town of Springfield! When the brilliant Chief Wiggum isn\u2019t able to produce results, the town forms a neighborhood watch and elects Homer as their leader. In a shocking turn of events, Homer is ineffectual and rampantly abuses his power. Luckily Grandpa is there to catch the culprit \u2013 Molloy! This episode, especially the escapades of the town males and any moment of Chief Wiggum onscreen, is A+ simpsons quality. (Side note: this is the episode that actually contains the classic Dr. Strangelove bomb drop reference)\nEpisode 93\nThis is the episode where The Simpsons say \"Yes, we know.\"\nFads, the fickleness of fame, the allure and mundanity of show business and Conan.\n\"If anyone needs me, I will be in my room.\"\nEpisode 94\nSean Westcott (@basementhacker)\n\"Please don't make me return to the scene of my spiritual de-pantsing\"\nApu looses his job (thanks to Homer) and moves in with the Simpsons featuring one of the better song and dance numbers \"Who needs a Kwik -E- Mart\" with guest appearance by James Woods.\n\"Who need's a Kwik -E-Mart ...WE DO\"\nEpisode 95\nLisa vs. Malibu Stacy\nMichael Ratty (@HeyRatty)\nA disastrous appearance by Matlock in Springfield has Grampa Simpson thinking about his mortality, so he vows to make the most his winter years by working for Squeaky-Voiced Teen at Krusty Burger. Lisa is disgusted by the sexist platitudes coming from Talking Malibu Stacy, so she reaches out to the toymaker but is rebuffed. With the help of the top Malibu Stacy collector Waylon Smithers, Lisa finds the doll\u2019s creator and sets out to make a new, intelligent doll young girls can look up to. The new doll (\"Lisa Lionheart\") doesn\u2019t sell well but reaches at least one customer.\nEpisode 96\nDeep Space Homer\nMichael Ratty (@HeyRatty)\nIn one of Season 5\u2019s best episodes, Homer finds out if he has the Right...what\u2019s that Stuff? Stymied by low television ratings, NASA (Nassau?), recruits Homer and Barney to compete to become the first everyman astronaut. Homer wins by de-fault (\"the two sweetest words in the English language!\") and travels to space with Buzz Aldrin and Race Spanion. Disaster strikes via an opened bag of potato chips and a curiously placed insect farm (\"HAIL ANTS\") but Homer saves the day w\/ the help of James Taylor and an Inanimate Carbon Rod. In Rod We Trust.\nEpisode 97\nHomer Loves Flanders\nEden Rohatensky (@edenthecat)\nAfter reluctantly attending a sold out football game with Flanders, Homer chooses Flanders as his new BFF. Homer becomes excessively attached, wanting to spend every day with Flanders. Flanders becomes annoyed by Homer\u2019s overbearing attitude, in addition to Homer destroying Flanders\u2019 reputation within the church \u2014 while Homer receives praise for charity work begrudgingly done with Ned.\nFlanders becomes so annoyed with Homer that he lashes out against Homer\u2019s nose-breathing during a moment of silence in church. The congregation persecutes Flanders for this, but Homer defends his friend - causing the two to vow their true (though temporary) friendship.\nHonestly, who wouldn\u2019t want a neighbour like Flanders?\nEpisode 99\nMonica Petraitis (@monicamartinez)\nClassic Simpsons \u2014 funny lines and solid storyline that shows money can't buy everything.\nA near-death experience leads Mr. Burns to search for an heir to carry on his legacy and inherit his fortune. He selects Bart, who quickly gets used to the luxury and special treatment.\nWhen Bart doesn't get the same treatment at home, he decides to live at the mansion. He grows to miss his family, but Burns tricks him into believing his family doesn't want him anymore. When Burns demands that Bart fire his father to prove his loyalty, Bart realizes he loves his family and fires Mr. Burns as his \"Dad.\"\nEpisode 100\nSweet Seymour Skinner's Baadassss Song\nMonica Petraitis (@monicamartinez)\nAfter Bart accidentally gets Principal Skinner fired, he hangs out with Skinner out of guilt, and the two become friends. But Skinner misses his authoritative role, and re-enlists in the Army.\nMeanwhile, Skinner's replacement Ned Flanders lets the school fall into chaos, and Bart realizes he needs Skinner as his counter-character. Bart schemes to get Flanders fired, which ultimately happens when Chalmers witnesses, not the chaos, but the religious element that Flanders brought to the school.\nWith Bart's advice, Skinner is able to get out of the Army and get his job back. Bart, in turn, gets his nemesis back.\nEpisode 101\nThe Boy Who Knew Too Much\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nAfter a first act cat and mouse tale of Bart playing hooky, this episode centers around a young Quimby best understood when he tells the woman in his car, \"I\u2019m not paying you to talk.\"\nHomer is selected for jury duty (Lisa: \"I knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail\") and Bart is torn between letting an innocent man go to prison and telling Skinner, a man who thinks Free Willie \"a disobedient whale,\" that he skipped school.\nHomer\u2019s greed stalls the jury long enough for Bart\u2019s guilt to clear Quimby. Though perhaps imagined as the writing team\u2019s commentary on the young Kennedys, this episode became a riff on the legal system (chicks on the bench!) and a setup through which to showcase Bart and Homer (and Skinner!). It\u2019s the show near its peak of hilarity.\nEpisode 102\nJulio Angel Ortiz\nAn episode that comes across fairly flat. Each storyline doesn\u2019t bring much new to the table. Bart\u2019s storyline of using his dad\u2019s credit card doesn\u2019t wind up meaning much and feels like filler. And the clichéd matchmaking plot, despite the usual Simpsons special sauce (Meta commercial joke? Retro-animation jazz scene? Judge Reinhold reference?) does little to spice up an episode that feels as tired as a Matlock marathon. An example of the series trying to be too clever for it\u2019s own good, but like a cynical Generation X kid, I\u2019d say, \"Prove it.\"\nEpisode 103\nSecrets of a Successful Marriage\nPatrick Fisher (@pwkfisher)\nDespite making off with everyone\u2019s cash at poker, he comes to the realization that he might be slow\u2026.a couple hours after Carl calls him slow. The natural response? To teach a class on having a good marriage, of course! But, when Homer start spilling his marriage secrets to his students, Marge throws him out, leaving him to wither away in Bart\u2019s Treehouse. After some thought, he comes to realise that his gift to Marge is total dependence on her, and they happily make up.\nFavourite Quote: \"Hey! I\u2019m choking on my own rage over here!\"\nSeason 6\nBart of Darkness\nPatrick Fisher (@pwkfisher)\nIt\u2019s a hot summer in Springfield, and after getting a taste of the one day a year Poolmobile, Bart and Lisa successfully get a pool from Homer. Though, courtesy of Bart\u2019s fall, he breaks his leg and spends the summer isolated. Thanks to a gift telescope from Lisa, he spots Flanders screaming and burying something in the backyard. Thinking he killed Maude, he sends Lisa into his home to investigate. Once getting caught though, they find out it was just a plant he killed while Maude was away.\nFavourite Quote: \"Let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.\"\nEpisode 105\nLisa's Rival\nTony Kozuch (@tonykoz)\nAs evident from the title, this is a Lisa episode \u2014 and that's a great thing. We don't get too many Lisa-centric episodes, and this is a good one.\nIn a nutshell, Lisa takes pride in being the top brain at Springfield Elementary. When a new girl comes to town and is seemingly better than Lisa at everything, the middle-Simpson isn't quite sure how to cope. In the end, that status-quo is restored, but there are some good bits along the way. Lisa having a hard time even bounch a ball is a high-point.\nEpisode 106\nAnother Simpsons Clip Show\nTony Kozuch (@tonykoz)\nThe clip shows can be hit or miss in the days of DVD and on-demand, but back in the day, and episode like this would give you a nice trip down memory lane.\nIn the episode, Marge laments over the current lull in her marriage. Homer reminds her, through a series of clips, that their relationship is strong. Unfortunately, he only reinforces how tumultuous things have been.\nAll in all, a good episode to relive some classic moments, with a nice little wrapper setting them up.\nEpisode 107\nItchy & Scratchy Land\nAmber M\nEasily in the top 10 episodes from the first 10 seasons, this is the single most quoted Simpsons episode of all time*. The family takes a road trip to the Disney-esque Itchy & Scratchy Land where things are not as happy as they seem. There are too many classic quotes from this episode to list them all, but remember to stock up and your Bort license plates and remind Marge\u2019s older, balder, fatter son that we\u2019re parked in the Itchy lot, where nothing can possi-bleye go wrong, and let us never speak of the shortcut again.\n*In my household\nSideshow Bob Roberts\nAmber M\nMayor Quimby is under fire from Springfield\u2019s powerful Republicans (notable members include an Austrian movie star, an AM radio conservative pundit, and a green Nosferatu). Somehow, Homer doesn\u2019t remember Krusty\u2019s former sidekick who married Selma and was imprisoned for trying to kill Bart. Bob claims to be reformed, runs against Quimby in the mayoral race and wins. Lisa suspects something is amiss and uncovers a Chicago-voter-style scheme used to get Bob elected and exposes him just before the Simpsons\u2019 home is demolished to make way for the Matlock Expressway. Sideshow Bob goes back to prison and all is right Springfield again.\nEpisode 109\nTreehouse of Horror V\nEric Metelka (@eric3000)\nI'd like to focus on perhaps my favorite Treehouse segment of all time \u2014 \"Time and Punishment\". We hear Grandpa Simpson's astute advice to Homer on his wedding night: \"If you ever travel back in time, don't step on anything. Because even the slightest change can alter the future in ways you can't imagine.\" When Homer does travel to the past thanks to a hacked toaster and changes his present (and the laws of physics), \"Eh, close enough\" is his answer when he can't find his way home. I think most of us would agree with that.\nEpisode 110\nBart's Girlfriend\nEric Metelka (@eric3000)\nBart's crush on Reverend Lovejoy's daughter, Jessica, teaches us two lessons: 1. People aren't always who you think they are. The perfect reverend's daughter turns out to be far worse than Bart is. 2. Guys will do anything to win the favor of a pretty girl. Not the best episode of the stellar Season 6, but upon re-watching reminds us that The Simpsons at its best is a grounded family drama complete with allegories. The cut-aways, literal humor (Sarah plain and tall), physical comedy, and pop culture references (\"Silence of the Lambs\") are what make The Simpsons special.\nEpisode 111\nScott Gower (@scottmgower)\n\"Competitive violence! That's why you're here!\"\nA failing grade in P.E. threatens to spoil Lisa's flawless academic record until she discovers her hidden talent as a hockey goalie. This venture turns up the volume on the sibling rivalry between Bart and Lisa, as they are forced to go against each other in a matchup the entire town of Springfield is excited to see.\n\"The winner will be showered with praise. The loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore.\" - Homer J. Simpson\nEpisode 112\nScott Gower (@scottmgower)\n\"Ay, ay, ay! Es Homer Simpson. Me ha molestado! Oh!\"\nA candy-grabbing misunderstanding lands Homer with sexual harassment accusations from babysitter Ashley Grant. While Homer keeps making things worse for himself, an unexpected ally comes in the form of the peeping Groundskeeper Willie, whose video evidence frees Homer from the accusations.\nAshley: Hmm. Homer, I thought you were an animal, but your daughter said you were a decent man. I guess she was right.\nHomer: You're both right.\nGrampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\nShyam Sabhaya\nPlot: Homer and Marge are lacking intimacy in their marriage. Grampa Simpson comes to the rescue with an old family remedy. After seeing the success of the remedy, Homer and Grampa start selling the remedy to others in Springfield. Realizing Grampa never supported him, Homer fights with Grampa, who calls Homer an accident, leading to the end of their Simpson and Son business. Later, Homer and Grampa hug it out, calling themselves screw ups.\nHighlights: The children\u2019s theory on their parents\u2019 early bedtime. Al Gore. Remember, \"if it is in a book, then it has to be real\".\nOverall: 8\/10\nFear of Flying\nShyam Sabhaya\nPlot: After being kicked out of Moe\u2019s, Homer looks for another bar. Mistaken for a pilot, Homer causes an accident, leading to unlimited tickets for the Simpsons as the airline company covers it up. While the plane is preparing to takeoff, Marge freaks out, exposing her fear of flying. Seeing a therapist, Marge learns her fear stems from learning her father was a flight stewardess and not a pilot.\nHighlights: Never unscrew the top of a shaker as a prank. If your name is Guyin Cognito, run. Always repress your emotions. And remember, fix the roof and then bake.\nOverall: 9\/10\nHomer the Great\nChris Plante (@plante)\nHomer the Great is best known for its Emmy nominated song, \"We Do,\" a rousing drinking anthem belted by the Stonecutters, Springfield\u2019s Freemason-like fraternity. The episode is itself like \"We Do,\" crammed with jokes, references and backstory. In 20-some minutes, Homer goes from outsider to insider to leader to outsider again of the mysterious organization. In the end, Homer learns he\u2019s part of the best exclusive club: the family, of course. Homer the Great and Maggie Makes Three, the following episode, are debatably the perfect Simpsons pairing: The former is one of the show\u2019s funniest episodes, the latter one of its most sentimental.\nEpisode 116\nAnd Maggie Makes Three\nChris Plante (@plante)\nIn the words of episode 293 guest stars The Rolling Stones, \"You can\u2019t always get what you want, but if you try sometimes well you might find you get what you need.\" In this flashback episode about Maggie\u2019s first word, we learn a debt-free Homer quit his day job to work at the local bowling alley. Shortly after, Maggie is born. Unable to support a third child, Homer must return to the plant, hat in hand. The arc is simple, relatable and uplifting: a father must compromise his own happiness for his family, only to discover the work is worth it. \"Do it for her.\"\nEpisode 117\nBart's Comet\nJere Pilapil (@JerePila)\nPredictably, this is a great episode from a great Simpsons season. More predictable (but distressing)? All of the political satire is still sharp. From the start, where military pilots bicker about funding healthcare over military, to the end, where Congressional greed prevents Springfield from being saved from the titular comet, all of the satire is as relevant as ever.\nAnd now a list of people Homer considered more useful to the post-apocalyptic Springfield than Ned Flanders: Sideshow Mel, Barney, Helen Lovejoy, Dr. Nick Riviera, The Sea Captain, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney, nameless extras, Waldo on an ill-timed travel schedule.\nEpisode 118\nHomie the Clown\nJere Pilapil (@JerePila)\nI think the most enduring gag from \"Homie the Clown\" (an episode full of great gags) is Homer with a pickaxe popping \"speed holes \" into his car after a mob henchman shoots a car he\u2019s attempting to get for free by impersonating Krusty\u2026 You know what? So much happens in these episodes; that whole summary only two-thirds of the episode! It\u2019s a feat of terrific writing that the writers were able to convey a clear story with so many jokes while also finding time to give the world, \"These are speed holes. They make the car go faster.\"\nEpisode 119\nRaises hell and must go there\nMoons the citizens\nHomer vs. Patty and Selma\nKarim Mourad (@ratmfoo)\nBorrows from Patty and Selma\nSaves them from trouble\nA Star Is Burns\nSteve Black Jr. (@draggingalake)\nIn this episode, Springfield decided to host a Film Festival. \"Famed\" critic, Jay Sherman, was the guest start in this episode. This episode was really a cross between The Simpson and The Critic. The Critic was a short-lived animated series started by Al Jean. The films shown ranged from Apu's \"Bright Lights, Beef Jerky\" to Bart's \"The Eternal Struggle\" and Homer's favorite Hans Moleman's, \"Man Getting Hit by Football\". The best highlight of this episode was easily Señor Spielbergo who directed Burn's film.\nEpisode 122\nLisa's Wedding\nSteve Black Jr. (@draggingalake)\nLisa's Wedding is the first of four episodes (currently) that take place in the future. The episode eases in with some jokes at a renaissance fair. Lisa meeting a fortune teller who tells her of her future of love. Lisa, who is 23 now, falls in love with a British character, Hugh Parkfield. Hugh asks Lisa to marry him while in England, and they fly back so Hugh can finally meet the rest of the Simpsons. Lisa discovers that Hugh cannot stand her family and ultimately the relationship ends on Lisa choosing her dysfunctional family over her love.\nEpisode 123\nTwo Dozen And One Greyhounds\nJeff H. (@jeffunscripted)\nOne of my favorite episodes. After Santa's Little Helper get a race dog pregnant, the Simpsons have a ton of puppies, which Mr. Burns steals in an attempt to make a Greyhound tuxedo treating us to a musical rendition of \"See My Vest\" (ala Be Our Guest). After the puppies begin to stand, reminding him of Rory Calhoun, Mr. Burns decides not to kill them, and instead they win millions in dog racing. Seriously, this one is a classic with great jokes in it.\nEpisode 124\nThe PTA Disbands\nPatrick Fisher (@pwkfisher)\nThis episode is great just because it breaks a lot of moulds for characters - watching Bart have to behave because his mom is the teacher, watching Lisa struggle in a world without school to excel at, and watching Skinner fight with someone other than Bart. It\u2019s an episode packs with random jokes and laughter (Anita Bath, the debate about taxes, chaos at the bank, etc), and is one of my favourite episodes of the series.\nFavourite Quote: \"Oh come on now Edna we all know these children have no future! \u2026...prove me wrong, children! Prove me wrong!\"\nEpisode 125\nRound Springfield\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nConverging twin Bart\/Lisa plots remains my favorite Simpsons format, and, like standard-bearer \"Lisa\u2019s Substitute,\" the A-plot is sentimental while the B-plot is ferociously quote-worthy. Lisa adds Bleeding Gums to Bergstrom on her list of heroes to whom she\u2019s said goodbye. After his pep talk, punctuated by \"nobody ever suspects the butterfly,\" fails, Bart denies himself a Steve Allen Pog and uses his Hutz-derived legal winnings to help Lisa find peace, but it takes divine intervention to bring Murphy\u2019s music to Springfield. It\u2019s a solid foundation for those arguing for Lisa Simpson as television\u2019s greatest character.\nEpisode 126\nThe Springfield Connection\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nIn which Marge foils a counterfeit jeans ring operating out of her car-hole. Though it reaches the high bar for humor that classic Simpsons episodes set, the narrative arc here is actually as shoddy as those jeans. The setup, Marge seeking adrenaline (after an unexpected triumph over hoodlums giving three-card monte a bad name) and becoming a cop, is solid. I enjoy Herman and that his scheme laughed at its own absurdity, but the sequence failed to convince me that Homer should be absolved of his disrespect for his wife in uniform just as Marge\u2019s sudden retirement due to \"corruption\" could use the depth of Lisa\u2019s questions about the prison industrial complex. Relative to its era, this episode is certainly substandard.\nEpisode 127\nLemon of Troy\nLucas Choate (@lchoate)\nBased in part on the mythical military strategy, the Trojan Horse, Bart and company have to retrieve Springfield\u2019s lemon tree from the kids in Shelbyville who\u2019ve stolen it and are hiding it in the \"impenetrable fortress of suburbia\", an impound lot. Bart is in perfect form; he\u2019s insolent, optimistic and honest about who he is. Homer is great and \"stupider like a fox\" too.\nMost Simpsons fans will agree, Lemon of Troy is easily a top ten episode, maybe even in the top five. I'd call Lemon of Troy a favorite episode myself.\nEpisode 128\nWho Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)\nLucas Choate (@lchoate)\nMr. Burns, you insufferable shit. We all shot you. You deserved it. You've gone beyond the pale this time. While we've cowed to your demands and suffered your indignities in the past, no more. You, sir are a coward and a scoundrel.\nBurn in hell Mr. Burns.\nSeason 7\nWho Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)\nMichael Tizzano (@miketizzano)\nThe show sports a cast of characters so robust and memorable it can sustain a two-part murder mystery, replete with hilarious and fitting roles for each Springfield denizen. Moe\u2019s lonely life is revealed through polygraph, Dr Nick asks an unresponsive Mr Burns if his brain felt damaged, and Jasper tells us that sidewalks are for regular, not fancy, walkin\u2019. We are invariably charmed by the characters we\u2019ve come to know over six seasons, so much so that we laugh along with this self-indulgent exercise. The episode is whimsical, culturally literate, heartfelt, and everything else we\u2019ve come to expect from The Simpsons. \"Who Shot Mr Burns\" is an exemplar of the series, as well as a love letter to it.\nEpisode 130\nRadioactive Man\nMichael Tizzano (@miketizzano)\nMilhouse has greatness thrust upon him when Hollywood execs come to Springfield as cast him as Fall-Out Boy for the Radioactive Man film. In a delightful subversion, the small town folk scam and cheat the honorable show business people until they have nothing left. The episode\u2019s best moments feature Rainer Wolfcastle as the titular superhero, with all too quotable lines such as \"Up and at them!\" and \"My eyes! The goggles do nothing!\" Overall the episode is superficial, plot-thin and absurdly funny. What could have been a story about Bart and Milhouse\u2019s friendship becomes a cartoonish satire of our perceptions of Hollywood. Sometimes, only The Simpsons will do.\nEpisode 131\nHome Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nFirst, let me say that nothing in this episode, absolutely nothing, comes close to being as funny as an annoyed Abe Simpson going \"bitch, bitch, bitch.\" It\u2019s one of the best things to happen in this series, and that\u2019s saying lots.\nThe setup of \"toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion,\" among other things, taking the kids away is really just an excuse to showcase the Flanders family, whose house has a \"Pat Boone-ish\" quality to it.\nLong story short, Bart and Lisa hate it (\"They read Newsweek instead of nothing!\"), Maggie loves it, and Homer and Marge win the kids back after going through a silly public class. It\u2019s a predictable sitcom setup and trajectory, but the fabric is spun into gold. Today\u2019s writers are lost when it comes to writing this show, but episodes like this make it feel like the old team could do this all in their sleep. But I digress. Bitch, bitch, bitch.\nEpisode 133\nLisa the Vegetarian\nJohn Ryan Manning (@GhrondoRhondo)\nLisa decides to become a vegetarian despite Homer and the rest of the world trying to make her eat meat. It\u2019s a pretty great episode all around and It\u2019s the first full one written by David X Cohen (head writer of futurama) There\u2019s a very solid itchy and scratchy show that had me loling a bit, and a joke about \"independent thought alarms\" that had me loling a lot. Though, the most notable thing about this episode is that Lisa\u2019s decision to become a vegetarian carries on through the rest of the series as a permanent change, a rare phenomenon in The Simpsons.\nEpisode 134\nTreehouse of Horror VI\nJohn Ryan Manning (@GhrondoRhondo)\n\u2022 A bunch of giant advertising statues (like the Lard Lad Donuts guy) become sentient and destroy the town, Stay-puft marshmallow man style. It\u2019s fine. not LOL funny, but fun.\n\u2022 An homage to \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" with Groundskeeper Willy as the Freddy Krueger. Really well done, great detail in the animation of Willy as a giant bagpipe spider.\n\u2022 Trying to avoid Patty and Selma, Homer stumbles on a doorway to the third dimension. This episode is super memorable to me because the 3rd dimension scenes were actually done with CGI. It\u2019s a really fun and funny short with a dense mix of jokes and sci-fi.\nEpisode 135\nAugust Alfredsson (@alfrdalfrdalfrd)\n\"To start press any key. Where\u2019s the any key?\"\nSometimes you have to be careful what you wish for. In an attempt to be allowed to work from home, Homer has to gain 61 pounds to be classified as disabled. This classic episode is all about Homer\u2019s quest for doing as little work as possible, culminating with him sitting on the couch wearing a muumuu operating the terminal with a broom. He soon has to experience the drawbacks of his new lifestyle, but in the end it\u2019s his 300 pound body that saves springfield from a nuclear disaster.\nEpisode 136\nMother Simpson\nAugust Alfredsson (@alfrdalfrdalfrd)\nHomer\u2019s mother has been dead for 27 years when he meets her at a cemetery after faking his own death. How is she still alive? What has she been the last 27 years? The Simpson family starts to question her and she tells the story of why she left Homer and Abe. Young Chief Wiggum is hilarious. Lisa finally finds a like-minded person in the family. This is one of the most beautiful and sad episodes of the series, ending with Homer being left by his mother once again, sitting on the hood of his car watching the stars.\nEpisode 137\nSideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\nGeorge Ulloa (@geo1912)\nSideshow Bob, the thespian in jester\u2019s clothing. By the 7th season we have pretty much seen Bob move away from killing Bart to at this point aiming to destroy lowbrow culture. Bob currently staying in Springfield penitentiary does his prison labor at a local air show where he hijacks a nuclear bomb and threatens to blow up the town unless they shut down all television stations. Krusty sees this as a great opportunity to boost his rating (to 100%!) and defies Bob. Very smart, very meta, and filled to the brim with classic moments (I really want to see a show that involves a scorpion and a gasoline can). Also \"Sweet Enola Gay\" is R. Lee Emery is hilarious as Col. Leslie \"Hap\" Hapablap. While agree with Bob that the ending is cliché I cant help to be one of those slack jawed yokels who laughed every step of the way, and when you think about it isn\u2019t that what really matters?\nEpisode 138\nThe Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular\nGeorge Ulloa (@geo1912)\nWow. If there was a fourth wall this episode broke it, sat down next to you on the couch and asked if it could change the channel. One of the weirdest episodes ever made (and that\u2019s is including the equally wonderful 25 short stories about Springfield) but a successful experiment. Filled with deleted scenes and outtakes the episode feels very much like a clip show, but rather a great tribute to itself. From Troy McClure chain smoking while giving quizzes (what a shame I thought Bleeding Gums Murphy had more fans) to showing deleted scenes (I do not understand how someone would not include a Robotic Richard Simmons in an episode). There is episode is a fun mid season tribute to American favorite family. Though lets be honest here, you were all watching it for the hardcore nudity.\nEpisode 139\nMarge Be Not Proud\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nThis is the story of a mother failing to notice the warning signs her little boy is growing up and being shocked into it, despite his thirst for an excessively violent video game. Marge quotes Forrest Gump and doesn\u2019t flinch when Bart calls her lame.\nSeeing her son steal on video throws everything she thinks she knows about Bart into question. She breaks. She nearly ceases interaction, not out of anger, but because she doesn\u2019t feel she knows her son enough to.\nYoung boys love their mothers enough to follow the Oedipus complex narrative, but the chasm between them grows nigh exponentially. Bart showing his mother she wasn\u2019t so mistaken about her firstborn is one of the most precious moments of the series.\nEpisode 141\nTwo Bad Neighbors\nLore Keating (@lafemmebrulant)\nOnce upon a time, George H. W. Bush announced to the world that Americans should strive to be more like the Waltons, not the Simpsons. The creators had their satirical revenge when the 41st President arrives in Springfield. The episode is notable not only for its introduction of Disco Stu, but also for its more straightforward lampooning at the expense of the former president. By season seven, the hit show was being lauded for its wit and relatable characters. While often oafish, Homer is ultimately just a big kid, but one who frequently displays the heartfelt desire to resolve any issues surrounding (and frequently started by) his family. The greatest gag of the episode might be the episode itself as Homer acts just as irresponsibly as he was once called out to be, and then in a slight break from character offers no reconciliation or apology for his behavior throughout the episode. Rife with fast gags, and repeatedly inverting sitcom tropes surrounding compromise and learning-lessons, unlike much politically themed comedy this episode still merits laughs even eighteen years later.\nEpisode 142\nScenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield\nLore Keating (@lafemmebrulant)\nThe most literary of the season, episode 14 reminds the audience that The Simpsons was a brilliant social satire. When their TV is broken, the Simpson family drives to Ogdenville to purchase another at a thrift shop. There, Marge reluctantly buys a designer suit because of its bargain price. Delighted with it, she wears it everywhere, one day drawing the attention of a former high school classmate. The classmate invites Marge to the local Country Club for the day. The characters of Springfield as the audience has always known them are dependably unchanging, but the rich of Springfield are distinct in the way their fashions vary daily. Desperate to fit in, Marge begins to alter the suit she so loves so that it will look new and hopefully better each time, cutting pieces away every night \u2013 a useful metaphor for her own degraded principles. But what in literature might have been a tragedy is saved by the humanity of her family when she finally realizes that she has altered herself enough, and they abandon the country club for a family dinner at Krusty Burger. Poignant social messages like the one in this episode are exactly what endeared audiences to The Simpsons, and it still works.\nEpisode 143\nBart The Fink\nNicole Scola (@NicoleLouiseS)\nOnce again, Bart messes with the life of Krusty the Clown.Bart, with the help of his new checking account and Krusty\u2019s Cayman Island Holdings Account stamp, gets the clown busted for tax fraud and in the throes of financial despair, Krusty crashes his plane into a mountain, killing himself\u2026.or did he? The great detective team of Bart and Lisa get the sneaking suspicion that Krusty faked his death and after they track down Rory B. Bellows, their suspicions are confirmed. The dynamic duo convince Krusty to comeback and with the life insurance policy of Rory B. Bellows, Krusty has the money to start over again.\nWhile not the best of the season, I\u2019d still give it a 7 out of 10, mostly because I want to go to Comic Book Guy\u2019s taco filled Doctor Who marathon.\nEpisode 144\nLisa the Iconoclast\nLucas Thomas (@pensivedumpling)\n\u2018Lisa the Iconoclast\u2019 is a perfectly cromulent episode. While Homer steals the role of Town Crier from Ned, Lisa heads to the Historical Society to research Sprinfield\u2019s founding father, Jebediah Springfield. Hidden in his fife she discovers proof that Jebediah was in fact the murderous pirate \"Hanz Sprungfeld. Lisa attempts to correct history but is thwarted by the towns hero worship. In the end she sees that indeed, \"A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man.\" and allows the myth to live on. This episode is ripe with the subtle jokes that define \"the good seasons\". It only leaves me with two questions:\n1. Where\u2019s the fife? And\n2. Gimme the fife.\nHomer the Smithers\nPatrick Fisher (@pwkfisher)\nNot only do you learn about how helpless Mr. Burns is, but you learn about Homer\u2019s hidden desire to do well at work. Of course, because he isn\u2019t very bright, he can\u2019t do any tasks well (Best scene in the episode is him somehow getting milk and cornflakes to spontaneously combust), and the insulting from Mr. Burns causes him to snap and punch him. Hiding in fear, he learns to become self sufficient...until Homer knocks him out of a window again.\nFavourite Quote: Homer: \"Your car is being crushed into a cube; You have thirty minutes to move your cube. Mr. Burns\u2019 office!\"\nMr. Burns: \"Is it about my cube?\"\nEpisode 146\nThe Day The Violence Died\nJeff H. (@jeffunscripted)\nIt's Itchy and Scratchy's 75th anniversary. Bart meets Chester J. Lampwick who claims that he, not Roger Myers, created Itchy. After he shows the original film to Bart and Milhouse, it goes up in flames, leaving no proof of creation. They hire Lionel Hutz & sue the film company for $800M. They win when Bart gets an Itchy drawing from the comic book shop which is dated and reveals Chester did create Itchy. The company goes bankrupt but is able to finance new cartoons after they sue the Post Office claiming their character was actually ripped off of Roger Meyer's actual creations. Doppelgangers of Bart and Lisa helped cause this. We end with a new Itchy and Scratchy cartoon that rips off Monty Pyhton and Looney Toons, among others.\nEpisode 147\nA Fish Called Selma\nD Davis (@dfdx2)\nTroy \"You may know me from such films as\" McClure is flirting with Selma and offers to take her to dinner in exchange for passing his eye test. After being seen with a real woman his agent who hasn't called in 8 years calls and tells him work will come. Selma is ok being in a sham marriage while Troy gets work in a remake of Planet of the Apes and is set to be the sidekick in a new McBain movie but he decides to star in his own creation \"The Contrabulus Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel\" FAIL!\nEpisode 148\nBart on the Road\nD Davis (@dfdx2)\nAfter going to work with Patty and Selma, Bart makes a fake driver\u2019s license and schemes with Millhouse, Martin, Nelson and he go the National Grammar Rodeo in Canada, but end up on a road trip to the Worlds Fair in Knoxville, The only one problem it was in 1982, now trapped when the sun sphere falls on the rental car. Bart calls Lisa for help. Bart becomes a courier the world but not to Springfield. Lisa tells Homer but promises to keep the secret, orders equipment and has it delivered by courier so the boys hide in the crate.\nEpisode 149\n22 Short Films About Springfield\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nIf this isn\u2019t a top five episode for you, you\u2019re wrong.\nThough many episodes demonstrate the quality that makes this show The Beatles of television, none so display the dimensionality of its universe that\u2019s so key to its phenomenon status.\nAmong so much, Dr. Nick warns of skin failure, and that Abe\u2019s skeleton will try to leap out the mouth and escape the body. Chief Wiggum stars in a strange Pulp Fiction homage (\"they don\u2019t call it a Krusty Burger with cheese\"). The Bumblebee Man bit reaches its only logical conclusion. Nelson is ordered to wave to the people and blow them kisses by the greatest single-scene character this show ever created.\nBut the best of all comes when Skinner tells Chalmers no, he may not see Aurora Borealis localized entirely within his kitchen.\nEpisode 150\nRaging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in \"The Curse of the Flying Hellfish\"\nJoey Daniewicz (@noisecritic)\nHere, we have a plot that seems reminiscent of the show\u2019s approach a decade later, but it survives and thrives on the tone and approach used by Simpsons episodes of yore. This is Abe Simpson\u2019s triumph. He\u2019s often tossed aside and laughed at a la Meg Griffin, but here he becomes the hero his stories about nickels with pictures of bumblebees on \u2018em told of.\nBurns has also rarely been as direct an antagonist as here, attempting to assassinate Abe for a fortune that\u2019s surely paltry to him and trying to murder Bart with no reason. Low on laughs (notably barring Burns\u2019 failed assassination attempts) but high on thrills and sentiment, \"Flying Hellfish\" succeeds on a blueprint of revealed character backstory that modern Simpsons writers would do well to study.\nEpisode 151\nJulio Angel Ortiz\nThis episode features a razor-sharp script that doesn\u2019t flinch away from the foils of mob mentality and scapegoating on the issues of immigration. The story is very appropriate in this day and age. Apu\u2019s flashback to life in India is very dated in the post-Politically Correct era. The script eschews the typical wealth of pop culture minutia (though they\u2019re still there) and replaces them with a lot of heart. The story straddles the fine line between preachy and commentary, and thankfully stays the course. A top-notch effort.\nEpisode 152\nHomerpalooza\nCory Anotado (@pacdude)\nBaby Boomers love the Grateful Dead, the Gen Xers can't get enough of Nirvana, and whatever the hell I am (Millenials? Gen Y? Apathetic?) won't shut up about the late 90s. Homerpalooza both reinforces that nostalgic notion with its storyline (It's hard\u2014and gut-wrenchingly painful\u2014to become and stay cool) and with its impressive lineup of cameos, like Cyprus Hill and Billy Corgan. The story itself is rote\u2014Homer puts himself in bodily harm to impress his kids\u2014but the special guests are hilarious. \"Homer Simpson, smiling politely,\" will never not get a chuckle from me.\nEpisode 153\nSummer of 4 Ft. 2\nJonathan Johnson (@jonolafjohnson)\nWhile the Simpson family (and Milhouse) vacation to the Flandereses\u2019 beach house in Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport, Lisa\u2014frustrated with her lack of friends\u2014makes new friends after donning a new look and personality.
