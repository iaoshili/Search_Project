Maybe this year you unwrapped a 17-inch gaming behemoth \u2014 or maybe you\u2019re holding an 8-inch tablet. Either way, there\u2019s a lot more to Windows 8 than Office and Internet Explorer. Some of the best apps live in the Windows Store, while you\u2019ll have to dig around the web to find others. But if you know what to look for, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can\u2019t  do. And once you\u2019re firing on all cylinders, just fire up Steam and let Skyrim melt your holiday stress away.\nThis year we've picked out some of the very best apps, games, books, and downloads for your new devices.

It's hard to go wrong with to-do app Wunderlist , and the full-featured app has reminders, due dates, and perhaps most importantly, it seamlessly syncs across iOS, Android, Mac, and when you need it, the web.\nSkitch\nFor collaborating at the office or detailing how to get a house full of screaming kids to a sledding excursion, Skitch offers a quick and painless way to share screenshots and annotate with text, drawings, and arrows.\nOneNote\nSimilar to Evernote, Microsoft's OneNote note-taking app can be almost anything you want it to be. You can save text, pictures, and links (the paid version adds other types of media) to your library, and it's all synced to the cloud for easy searching and sharing.\nChrome\nChrome combines speed and minimal good looks with a Web Store busting at the seams with extensions and apps. With the addition of the Chromecast, Chrome is now the next-best way to put anything on your TV, whether it\u2019s The Verge or an episode of Breaking Bad.\nPidgin\nChat apps may be increasingly moving to the web and mobile devices, but there's still a need for a dedicated desktop app. Pidgin consolidates your Facebook Chat, Google Talk, AIM, and other accounts into one app, saving you the headache of all those tabs.\nWinDirStat\nDisk-usage apps might not be the most exciting thing, but there's no faster way to figure out why dad's computer is running out of space. WinDirStat's visual, block-based UI gives you the information you need at a glance \u2014 and it's a free download.\nTuneIn\nYour new computer can't be all about work, right?

You'll never be without something to isten to again.\nComixology\nOdds are, there\u2019s a beautiful screen on the Windows device you just opened. What better way to use it than to read Batman, The Avengers, and The Walking Dead? Comics by Comixology has thousands of comics at cheap prices, with a great reading interface and plenty of ways to find new things to read.\nMusic Maker Jam\nYou don\u2019t play an instrument, or sing, or understand GarageBand, but you\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019re better than Skrillex. Music Maker Jam is an ultra-simple way to prove it: it\u2019s a hyper-visual mixing app that\u2019ll let you easily play DJ at your New Year\u2019s party, seamlessly fading between songs and tweaking the music just enough to really look like you know what you\u2019re doing.\nVLC\nOver a decade ago, the VLC Media Player gained a reputation for playing any audio or video file, no matter how exotic. That hasn\u2019t changed. Even corrupted, half-downloaded files will sometimes still play. The app\u2019s ugly interface is a small price to pay.\nIrfanView\nWhen you need to quickly edit an image, why wait for Photoshop to load? Irfanview is an incredibly lightweight photo editor that can slice and dice entire batches of photos in mere seconds. Just don\u2019t look for multiple undos or layered compositions.\nSteam\nSteam is Valve\u2019s downloadable storefront where you can buy triple-A games like Bioshock Infinite, indie titles like FTL, and everything in between. But Steam is more than just a place to buy games \u2014 you can chat with friends, gain achievements, and even open Big Picture Mode and use your PC like a console on the big screen.\nFlipboard\nFlipboard is one of the best, most visual ways you'll find to read news.

Notepad++ adds powerful features like regular expressions, tabbed browsing, and the ability to compare two documents side by side. Color-coded syntax highlighting makes it particularly useful if you code or work with websites.\nRainmeter\nNormally it takes some know how to bend Windows to your will. Rainmeter does all the heavy lifting with quick, downloadable ways to make your Windows desktop into anything you can think of. Whether you just want to see the weather on your desktop or you want your computer to look straight out of Iron Man, it\u2019s just a Rainmeter download away.\n","Title":"The best apps for your new Windows PC | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","apps","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5007535"]}
