You spend a lot of time at conventions, and a pair of Firefly actors want to let fans know what it's like from their perspectives. Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk are  launching a web series called Con Man about two former sci-fi stars \u2014 yes, one a ship's captain, the other its pilot \u2014 who have gone on to have wildly different levels of success. Fillion's character is a huge star, while Tudyk, who is writing and directing this series, plays a character who's still stuck in smaller roles.\nThe show is about their experiences at conventions\nThe show focuses on Tudyk's character as he attends conventions and other events. It's supposed to be based in part on the experiences \u2014 strange, funny, or otherwise \u2014 that he's had over the years while interacting with fans and others in the convention world. \"If you\u2019ve gone to a sci-fi convention, you\u2019ve only seen half of it,\" Tudyk says in  a statement . \"Con Man delivers what convention \u2018all-access\u2019 passes have only promised in the past.\"\nTudyk and Fillion  went to Indiegogo to raise money for Con Man and quickly exceeded their goal of $425,000. At press time, the campaign is sitting closer to $650,000 with a month to go. How many episodes Tudyk makes will depend on the final funding. Right now, he's committed to four, with a fifth episode being added at $725,000. A handful of other sci-fi stars will also appear in the series. That includes Firefly costars Gina Torres and Sean Maher, Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn, as well as Felicia Day, Amy Acker, and Seth Green. It's a crew and a concept that deep sci-fi fans won't be able to ignore, so it's no surprise that the campaign is already funded: the real question is how high it'll go.\n","Title":"Firefly stars Nathan Fillion and Alan Tudyk are making a web series | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
