{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt was only a matter of weeks ago when Sony Pictures Entertainment sheepishly admitted it had no plans to release The Interview after suffering a massive data breach \u2014 reportedly at the hands of North Korea. It's pretty incredible how much has changed since then. We've seen the Seth Rogen \/ James Franco comedy make its way through a limited theatrical run, pushed out to every video-on-demand service known to man, and now we'll be getting a physical media release to close it all out. Today, Sony Pictures announced that The Interview will come to Blu-ray and DVD on February 17th. It's being packaged in a cheekily-named \"Freedom Edition,\" which is pretty terrible. But hey, kudos to Sony if it wants to provoke and poke fun at the hackers that caused the studio so many headaches.\nI'm talkin' about freedom\nYou'll be getting bonus content that wasn't available on demand, too. That includes 90 minutes of extra footage, split up across deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and a seven-minute blooper reel \"that shows the outrageous gags and goofs from the set.\" Might they prove funnier than the movie itself?  The bar's not very high . The Blu-ray and DVD release also includes commentary from Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg and Naked and Afraid, a Discovery Channel special featuring Rogen and Franco.\nPer The Los Angeles Times , Sony says it now expects to break even on The Interview, which cost $44 million to produce. So while the company has been forced to deal with embarrassing email exchanges and leaked films, The Interview saga hasn't turned into the disaster many predicted thanks to  decent Christmas Day ticket sales and an even bigger haul from VOD rentals. The Blu-ray and DVD release essentially closes the book \u2014 at least until we can stream Kim Jong-un's graphic demise in 4K UHD.\n","Title":"The Interview is coming to Blu-ray and DVD on February 17th | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
