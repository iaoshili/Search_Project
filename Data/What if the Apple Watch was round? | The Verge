{"Main text":"What if the Apple Watch was round?\n... and it's 2015\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple\u2019s Watch was unveiled to the world earlier this week as a rounded square timepiece. While Motorola has opted for a circular smartwatch with the Moto 360, Apple\u2019s Watch will be available early next year in two square editions and a variety of finishes. Square might be the only option in Apple\u2019s smartwatch portfolio right now, but what would a circular Apple Watch look like?\nUX and UI designer Alcion has opened up Photoshop and some 3D rendering software to find out. In a series of concept images, Alcion offers a glimpse at what Apple\u2019s smartwatch would look like with a circular display. Perhaps not surprisingly, there are a number of UI elements that match a round display perfectly, including the home interface and activity monitor. Apple\u2019s Watch might be a little chunky square with bulging sides right now, but this thin concept shows the potential for future generations. Just don\u2019t expect smartwatch components to get squeezed into a thin and elegant frame anytime soon.\nAll images copyright Alcion .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
