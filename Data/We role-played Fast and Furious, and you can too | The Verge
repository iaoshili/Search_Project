{"Main text":"We role-played Fast and Furious, and you can too\nRide or roll a die\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Rock, Vin Diesel, and Ludacris go for a birthday joy ride when suddenly they are ambushed by agents of a shadowy organization in souped-up Toyota Camrys. Roll a die and punch bad guys.\nThis is Fast and Furious 6.5, a special role-playing audio podcast adventure we made in honor of The Verge's new transportation hub, because it's April Fools' Day, and because a new Fast and Furious film is hitting theaters this week starring known D&D enthusiast Vin Diesel.\nThe episode is part of our new Verge Extras feed, which you can find on  iTunes , on  Soundcloud , or you can  subscribe directly with RSS in your podcast app of choice.\nNow, I imagine you have a few questions:\nDid you say Dungeons and Dr\u2014\nWait! Don't leave! Yes, this experience is based (very loosely) on the rules from Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, but you won't be hearing us talk numbers too much at all. We wanted to make the listening experience enjoyable (or at least accessible) for those who don't know or don't care about any of that stuff.\nA dice roll simply determines whether you do cool stunts or fall on your ass\nHere's all you need to know: sometimes a player will want to do something so crazy that the game master \u2014 that's me \u2014 will ask them to roll the dice (a \"check\"). A high number is good. A low number is bad. And you get a bonus if your character is naturally adept at the thing (e.g. it's easier to pick up very large objects if you're The Rock).\nWhat do I need to know about Fast and Furious?\nThe campaign takes places after Fast 6 but before the post-credits scene. Which is to say, the crew is back in the states with amnesty and lots of money, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) is an amnesiac, and Ian \/ Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) hasn't killed Han or called Dom yet (click to reveal Fast 6 spoilers).\nThe most important thing in the world is NOS (nitrous oxide), which, like in the movies, will make anything and everything supercharged.\nAs far as the characters themselves are concerned, they are slightly heightened versions of their movie counterparts. Hobbs (Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson) can lift anything, Dom (Vin Diesel) is a car whisperer, and Tej (Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges) is a computer wizard who can hack any computer on the planet.\nCan I play this myself?\nYes! While we strongly de-emphasized numbers for the podcast, we did in fact make full character sheets that you can use with D&D 5th Edition \u2014 and some blank sheets for you to make your own characters, which you can find below.\nA couple notes:\nSome of the skills have been changed to match the world. For example, magic is now computer hacking.\nAll crazy car stunts require you to have knowledge of the car and what it's capable of \u2014 which is why our vehicle handling skill (formerly animal handling) is based on the character's wisdom.\nWill there be another episode?\nOnly if there's a demand for it! There's more story to be told, but we kind of saw this as a one-time experiment. If you like it enough, though, please let us know via email, Twitter, the comments on this page, and especially iTunes.\nIf you do want more, please tell us what you liked (or didn't like). More Letty? Higher stakes? More action movie one-liners? A different franchise altogether? We'd love the feedback!\nIn the meantime, if you like this kind of show, you should  check out The Adventure Zone podcast, a comedy D&D podcast starring our friends Justin, Griffin, Travis, and Clint McElroy of MBMBaM and Polygon fame.\nWho do you want to thank right now?\nLots of people! Thank you to the players: Senior Editor Chris Plante (aka Tej), Engagement Editor Helen Havlak (aka Dom), and  Fastcast co-host Creighton DeSimone (aka Hobbs).\nThank you, John Lagomarsino, who recorded and edited this. Thank you, Dylan Lathrop, for making custom character sheet templates. Thank you, Dieter Bohn, for last-minute edits on the characters (it sounded something like, \"Dude, The Rock ripped off his own cast and then carried a gatling gun down the street \u2014 you need to make him stronger\"). And thank you for reading this far!\nOkay, so... I listened to the podcast and noticed you didn't really use the character sheets that much at all. There were also a few times where people would roll high numbers and you still put everyone in dire situations. It seemed like you were ignoring all your own rules just to make the whole thing more dramatic.\nYep.\nDownloadable character sheets\nClick on each individual sheet for a high-resolution PNG. We've also bundled everything together into one PDF , which additionally includes a blank character sheet for making your own Fast and Furious character.\n","Title":"We role-played Fast and Furious, and you can too | The Verge","Tags":["culture","podcast","tldr","entertainment"]}
