You want this; you aspire to have this.\nA smart dashboard for everyone\nNot Panasonic, though. For CES 2015, the company is presenting its own Android Auto dashboard in a matte plastic shell. No frills or chrome; just a standard auto console encasing. The control knobs are large, simple, and unassuming. It looks, as Chris Ziegler points out, like a monochrome Etch-a-Sketch frame.\nBut here's why it works. I see this demo, and I can immediately imagine Android Auto fitting perfectly in a middle-of-the-road minivan. Or an entry-level sedan you'd get soon after acquiring a driver's license. It looks as standard as a cassette player a 1995 Toyota Camry. And if Panasonic and Google want mainstream adoption of Android Auto (spoiler: they absolutely do), this is how it's going to look. Oh, and it  supports Apple Carplay , as well.\nAfter all, the best-selling car of 2014 wasn't a Lexus.  It was Ford's pick-up truck , followed by more pick-up trucks, a Camry, and a Honda Accord.\n","Title":"Panasonic knows Android Auto will look good in a minivan | The Verge","Tags":["google","hands--on","tech","transportation","ces-2015"]}
