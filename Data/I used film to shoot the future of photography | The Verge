{"Main text":"I used film to shoot the future of photography\nWho needs digital cameras anyway?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\u201CYou\u2019re crazy,\u201D a senior manager at a major camera company told me today. We were talking at CP+, Japan\u2019s biggest photo event, and I\u2019d just shown him the camera gear that I was using for the day's coverage. It all used film \u2014 not a digital sensor in sight.\nIf this were my first day at CP+, and if I\u2019d been expecting any breaking news, I\u2019d have had to agree with him. But I got all that out of the way yesterday \u2014 I took a lot of digital pictures of the camera world's new digital products , but I was struck by the lack of film presence even at a Japanese show. Today, I wanted to see what it\u2019d be like covering the event with the technology that it\u2019s abandoned. My goal was to take enough images for a photo essay and publish them on The Verge the same day, in the spirit of timely photojournalism.\n90 minutes and $17 later, I had my photos on a CD\nI own a lot of film cameras, but the ones I brought along today were a Nikon F80, known as the N80 in the US, and a Fujifilm Natura Classica. The F80 is an awesome camera that handles more or less like a modern Nikon DSLR with all the useless buttons and convoluted menus removed. The Natura Classica is a compact camera the size of a cigarette packet that was released in the mid-2000s. Since CP+ is indoors, I shot both these cameras using ISO 800 film, which tends to be grainier than I\u2019d like but lets me use faster shutter speeds in low light. I used a bright 50mm f\/1.8 D lens with the F80 to better my chances and hoped that the 28mm f\/2.8 wide end of the Natura Classica\u2019s zoom lens would prove sufficient.\nOnce I\u2019d finished my two rolls, I walked about 25 minutes to the nearest Camera no Kitamura, a ubiquitous photo store chain that I figured would be my best bet for speedy development. Roughly 90 minutes, 2,080 yen (about $17), and one drawn-out iced coffee later, I had a CD filled with scans of the photos I\u2019d taken just a few hours earlier. It's always exciting when you get film photos back; you remember moments seen through the viewfinder and hope they turn out the way you'd imagined. The image at the top of this story is one I thought would work on at least some level as soon as I pressed the shutter, but I had to wait for hours to be sure \u2014 it's a world away from instant Instagram gratification.\nSo, how did they turn out? Well, you can judge for yourself below, but it\u2019s safe to say the results were mixed. The F80 performed better than the Natura Classica, which isn\u2019t too surprising given the faster lens and accurate viewfinder. The Natura Classica is actually designed for Natura 1600 film, a unique Fujifilm emulsion that works with the camera and gives amazing, ultra-clean results in low light. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t have any on hand today \u2014 things would\u2019ve gone a lot better if I had. As it happened, the results from the Superia 800 film I used were too grainy at best and unusable at worst. But some of the F80 shots I took had great, smooth tones and a much more attractive grain.\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d recommend shooting film for fast-paced work in 2015, but there\u2019s something to it. It forces you to slow down and think about each shot, and the result is that you end up with a lot less digital detritus to wade through when it comes to post-processing. And speaking of post-processing, I didn\u2019t do any on these shots beyond some simple crops on a few; not having to worry about white balance, ISO, and other settings is another weight off the photographer\u2019s shoulders. The photos I took yesterday are technically better, sure. But I had to take a lot more to get there, and it wasn't as much fun. The 90-minute waits and 25-minute walks notwithstanding, shooting film feels purer and more efficient.\nWhile I\u2019ll no doubt save the $17 next time I go to a trade show with actual news to report, this was a fun experiment with one of the most enduring technologies ever created. Photography has been around for the best part of two centuries, but it\u2019s easy to forget that digital imaging has only existed for a tiny sliver of that.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nA Casio representative demonstrates its point-and-shoot cameras that are designed to improve your golf swing.\nTo find film cameras at CP+, you have to find accessory makers with a taste for the retro.
