{"Main text":"64 Comments\nWelcome to the first annual Verge Hack Week. We\u2019re totally blowing up our site: we\u2019ve given our reporters and editors the entire week to play with new tools and experiment with new storytelling ideas, while members of our amazing product team have gathered in New York to help build all sorts of interesting new things. Learn more.\nPerhaps it\u2019s having grown up in the \u201980s and a hearty dose of nostalgia in the face of overwrought visual effects in modern movies, but there\u2019s something indescribably powerful about the special effects in films like Blade Runner, Alien, and Dark City. It was an era before CG took over, a time when nearly a century of practical special effects culminated in whole armies of craft workers and artists that knew how to bring the audience to another world or dimension.\nVisual effects masters like Douglas Trumbull, the mind behind the visual effects in Blade Runner, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and 2001: A Space Odyssey pushed the limits of filmmaking in the blockbuster era and beyond.\nIn a welcome change from the prequels \u2014 and trends in big-budget Hollywood effects \u2014 Looper director Rian Johnson recently told The Hollywood Reporter that the new Star Wars films would return to some of the practical effects that the originals used so effectively to help you suspend disbelief. Few spaceflight sequences feel as real or urgent as the Millenium Falcon flying through the Rebel Fleet on the way to the Death Star in Return of the Jedi.\nWith these sequences in mind, we take a look at some of our favorite modern practical effects to grace the silver screen, from the moodiness of Blade Runner\u2019s Los Angeles to the intricacies of Tim Burton\u2019s vision of Gotham City.\nStar Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)\nFollowing legendary films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, visual effects legend Douglas Trumbull moved on to work on the return of Captain Kirk and crew in the first big screen adaptation of Star Trek: The Motion Picture . Spock\u2019s interaction with the sentient V\u2019Ger cloud, which masterfully mixed both in-camera and post-production techniques, recalls much of 2001\u2019s far out finale.\nAlien (1979)\nPacked with an all-star team of talent including H.R. Giger, Dan O\u2019Bannon, and director Ridley Scott, Alien\u2019s haunting design still holds up decades later.\nBlade Runner (1982)\nDouglas Trumbull and the visual effects team initially had trouble building the now iconic Blade Runner police spinner miniatures. Trumbull said \u201Cit looked like a flying brick. It took an enormous amount of energy to make it appear aerodynamic and interesting\u2013continually adding flashing lights and other effects .\u201D The spinner scene still makes for a fantastically believable liftoff .\nDune (1984)\nIn David Lynch\u2019s Dune , Emililo Ruiz used scale models and exact perspective to emphasize the visual impact of the spaceships from the Houses Harkonnen and Atreides.\nBatman (1989)\nInfluenced by Terry Gilliam\u2019s Brazil, Tim Burton worked with Anton Furst to create a new bleak and incredibly dark Gotham City overrun by crime.\nIndependence Day (1996)\nVolker Engel, Douglas Smith, Clay Pinney and Joseph Viskocil took home the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for their work on Independence Day, Roland Emmerech\u2019s film that leaned towards practical effects for more realistic explosions and visuals .\nThe Fifth Element (1997)\nFor 1997\u2019s operatic, over-the-top Fifth Element , Director Luc Besson built a scale model of 23rd century New York City.\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\nDirector Christopher Nolan worked with New Deal Studios to build the 1:3 scale models for the Batmobile tumbler and garbage truck for The Dark Knight\u2019s riveting crash sequence.\n","Title":"It's all in the details: these miniatures changed movies | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","verge-hack-week-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5794558"]}
