{"Main text":"Jeb Bush thinks net neutrality is crazy\nThe former governor spoke to voters in Iowa this weekend\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush is  almost certainly running for president in 2016, and he's recently been weighing in on several hot button topics. Last month, he dumped the email addresses and social security numbers of hundreds of Florida residents online \" in the spirit of transparency \" before almost immediately attempting to  undo it . Now, young Bush has some thoughts on net neutrality. Speaking at the Cedar Rapids Pizza Ranch in Iowa this weekend, Bush criticized President Obama's stance on internet regulation, saying it would \"stifle competition, stifle innovation.\"\n\"The idea of regulating access to the internet with a 1934 law is one of the craziest ideas I\u2019ve ever heard,\" he said.\n\"It's crazy,\" says the guy at the pizza ranch\nThis is the first time Jeb Bush has spoken publicly about net neutrality. Bush is responding to the FCC's  recent decision to protect the internet with Title II regulation. The Open Internet Order will prevent tiered internet by prohibiting  paid fast lanes, site blocking, and speed throttling .\nBush's comments mimic the stance of several Republicans and  broadband providers who say net neutrality gives the government too much control.  The New York Times notes Republicans in Congress reacted the same way in 1934 when President Roosevelt first passed Title II of the Communications Act. It is likely that Congressional opponents of net neutrality will attempt to pass legislation to overturn the FCC's ruling.\nThe FCC has not yet released the full text of its net neutrality rules. All five commissioners \u2014 including net neutrality opponents Ajit Pai and Mike O\u2019Rielly \u2014 will have to submit edits on the rules before they are released to the public.\n","Title":"Jeb Bush thinks net neutrality is crazy | The Verge","Tags":["web","policy","culture","us-world"]}
