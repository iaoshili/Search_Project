{"Main text":"Scarlett Johansson is now in a band, everybody\nFeaturing members of Haim and TV on the Radio\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHi, hello, please take a seat, I have some news. Actress Scarlett Johansson, of Lost in Translation and The Nanny Diaries fame, has started a band. And it's not just any band \u2014 it's a star-packed supergroup featuring Este Haim of indie darlings  Haim , singer-songwriter Holly Miranda, pop singer Julia Haltigan, and Kendra Morris, who was once a contestant on a Fuse TV talent competition.\nThe group is called The Singles (which is already the name of at least one band ) and their debut track is \"Candy.\" It was produced by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek, and it sounds like just the sort of face-stretching, queasy dance song you'd play if you were a preteen at a slumber party... or if you were trying to get someone to leave your house.\nHere are some sample lyrics:\n\"Boy, I'm like a piece of sticky gum.\"\n\"Boy, I'm melting from your tongue.\"\n\"Boy, I'm your lollipop, beware.\"\n\"Yum, yum, pop.\"\nYou may remember when Johansson released an album of Tom Waits covers. This is like that, in the sense that it's also music. Scar Jo  told Rolling Stone she wanted the song to sound like she was \"in on the joke,\" so we'll have to take her word for it.\n","Title":"Scarlett Johansson is now in a band, everybody | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","music"]}
