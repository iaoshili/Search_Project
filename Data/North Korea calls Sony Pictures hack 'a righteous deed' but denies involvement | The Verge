{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNorth Korea is applauding the devastating hack on Sony Pictures, though it is not taking responsibility for the attacks.  According to The New York Times , a spokesperson quoted by the North Korean Central News Agency said that the country was not involved in the hack and did not know why Sony was singled out as a target. However, he suggested that it \"might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers\" of North Korea who are joining its efforts to \"put an end to US imperialism.\"\n\"A film abetting a terrorist act.\"\nThe Sony Pictures hack, which put the company's  computer systems offline last month and led to leaks of  tens of thousands of sensitive documents , is suspected to come out of North Korea.  Code found from the attack is said to be similar to that used by North Korean hackers during hacks on the South last year.\nIn addition, the regime in North Korea has been outspoken against Sony Pictures' upcoming film, The Interview, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. The film centers around a wild plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un. In today's statements, a North Korean spokesperson called it \"a film abetting a terrorist act while hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership.\" It  has previously called the film \"an act of terror and an act of war.\" In addition, country officials have appealed directly to the United Nations to have the film banned.\n","Title":"North Korea calls Sony Pictures hack 'a righteous deed' but denies involvement | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
