Furthermore, any company staking a claim could tap \"related areas\" for mining, exploration, and other activities.\nNothing is set in stone, however. George Nield, the FAA's associate administrator for the Office of Commercial Transportation, explains:\n\"We didn\u2019t give (Bigelow Aerospace) a license to land on the Moon. We\u2019re talking about a payload review that would potentially be part of a future launch license request. But it served a purpose of documenting a serious proposal for a US company to engage in this activity that has high-level policy implications.\"\nBigelow Aerospace plans to test one of its habitats on the International Space Station later this year, and has proposed free-flying versions that could be used by government agencies, research organizations, businesses, and tourists. The company's goal is to have a series of bases on the Moon by 2025. Founder Robert Bigelow told Reuters that the decision doesn\u2019t imply actual ownership of the Moon. Instead, he says, it means \"somebody else isn\u2019t licensed to land on top of you or land on top of where exploration and prospecting activities are going on, which may be quite a distance from the lunar station.\"\nThe Outer Space Treaty says that no country has sovereignty over the Moon\nThe FAA oversees commercial space transportation in the US, but according to the report, the letter expands the agency's reach from just launch licensing to include US companies\u2019 planned activities on the Moon. Right now that is the domain of the United Nations Outer Space treaty, which explicitly states that \"outer space is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\" The Outer Space treaty also says that \"the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes.\"\nThe letter was coordinated with US Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce, as well as NASA and \"other agencies involved in space operations,\" according to Reuters.\n","Title":"The FAA wants to help US companies do business on the Moon | The Verge","Tags":["policy","science","us-world"]}
