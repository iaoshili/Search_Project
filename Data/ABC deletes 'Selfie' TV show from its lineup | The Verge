It's a popular word these days for describing a self-portrait, usually taken on a mobile phone, in many cases posted to a social media website with a faux-vintage colored filter. It was also, briefly, the name of a  comedy TV series on ABC starring Karen Gillan (formerly of Doctor Who) and John Cho (Harold in the Harold and Kumar series). Although seemingly doomed from the start by its irritating, forced topical name and threadbare premise (an obnoxiously narcissistic woman learns important life lessons from her nebbish male colleague), it actually won praise from  some viewers who found it a surprisingly effective critique of the emotional vacuousness of modernity. Or something. In any case, it's gone now: ABC won't be ordering a second season of the series, according to  TV Line . With the speed with which the show arrived and disappeared, perhaps it would have better been named Snapchat.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
