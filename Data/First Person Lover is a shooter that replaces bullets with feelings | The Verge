{"Main text":"First Person Lover is a shooter that replaces bullets with feelings\nIf your problems can't be solved with violence, try neon underwear\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere\u2019s a game where you can shoot people\u2019s clothes off with pastel bubble guns. It\u2019s called  First Person Lover , it\u2019s here to sell you sportswear, and it gives me hope for the future.\nFirst Person Lover was teased by Isbit Games a few months ago in a parody of the comically self-serious Hatred, an upcoming Polish mass-murder simulator starring a man-sized doodle from Dylan Klebold\u2019s Trapper Keeper. Hatred \u2014 whose latest trailer derides the human race for living in houses and owning furniture \u2014 would normally be ignorable. But its loudly proclaimed political incorrectness managed to catch the attention of Gamergate, whose supporters promptly voted it to the top of  Steam\u2019s Greenlight program while half-jokingly requesting the developers add \"social justice warrior\" victims and a \" Sarkeesian assassination sidequest.\"\nGamergate charges progressive critics with trying to take mechanics, competition, and \"fun\" out of games, focusing on feelings instead of systems and gameplay. In practice, it\u2019s just an echo of the old \"hardcore\" vs. \"casual\" debate, which The Escapist\u2019s Rowan Kaiser elegantly carved up in 2010: hardcore games are butch, casual games are femme, and the actual play matters less than which set of stereotypes something fits. \"It's not the content, it's the cover.\"\n'Hardcore' isn't a play style, it's a look\nNothing exposes the ridiculousness of this better than First Person Lover, a self-consciously traditional first-person shooter with a neon pink palette, teddy bear smoke grenades, and a respawn system based on clicking cute animal pictures. The mechanics and design are cookie-cutter but competent: you have weak melee and ranged love attacks, a street-sweeping love minigun, and a high-accuracy love bow, which you use to break down the hate-armor around hostile, zombie-like pedestrians. A voice on the radio will direct you around your objectives, until you\u2019re finally tossing love bombs at a puzzle boss riding a grizzly bear on top of a hate-fueled rocket. It\u2019s not the longest, hardest, or most sophisticated title, but it\u2019s met more \"real game\" requirements so far than Hatred, whose developers have talked a lot about their awesome fatality animations and very little about how to make an exciting challenge out of shooting people who can\u2019t fight back. It\u2019s even got leaderboards!\nBut First Person Lover isn\u2019t just a shooter pastiche, it\u2019s a clever and revealing mirror. Your love guns end up blasting enemies\u2019 dumpy suits off in a tastefully non-sexual way \u2014 they\u2019re enveloped in a cloud of smoke and reemerge curled over, vulnerable and slightly childlike.  Fast Co Design finds this mechanic \"strangely date rape-y,\" but it doesn't come off as a method of titillation or humiliation as much as a metaphorical rebirth, like you're some Narnian god  peeling off dragon-skins to reveal the decent person underneath. Instead of walking over to loot their bodies afterwards, you get \"love energy\" by magically clothing them in label Björn Borg\u2019s latest fashions, which makes everyone involved ridiculously happy.\nObviously, it\u2019s an advergame \u2014 you can even click to buy the clothes your protagonist is wearing. But arguably, so are games like Medal of Honor, which include hyper-realistic virtual firearms with the explicit goal of upselling players on their physical counterparts. The difference is that one is selling \"masculine\" destruction \u2014 a deadly gadget to be mastered, a serious symbol \u2014 and the other is selling \"feminine\" salvation \u2014 frivolous, vain, consumerist fashion.\n\"Can\u2019t games just be fun?\" has come to refer to a certain kind of fun in video games \u2014 the gleefully \"gritty\" torture porn of Grand Theft Auto and Hotline Miami, or the corny cheesecake pinups of Dragon\u2019s Crown. But in its own small way, First Person Lover shows us the fun of silly high-gloss hero fantasies \u2014 making the world better by saving people from their own internal demons. If only we could make all our trolls love us by shooting them with glitter and making them wear designer neon underwear.\n","Title":"First Person Lover is a shooter that replaces bullets with feelings | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
