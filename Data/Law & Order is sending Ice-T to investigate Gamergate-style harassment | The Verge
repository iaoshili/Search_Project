{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe  Gamergate movement , irrecoverably linked to the online harassment of women in the games industry, has drawn the ire of Joss Whedon, Patton Oswalt, Seth Rogen, and a number of other celebrities. But people who doxx,  SWAT , and threaten women on the internet are set to face  their biggest challenge yet in early February \u2014 Ice T.\nThe TV detectives get involved after a woman is assaulted at a convention\nThe rapper, actor, and  Body Count vocalist , who plays Odafin \"Fin\" Tutuola in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, is set to delve into the world of internet harassment in an episode of the show set to air on February 11th. The episode, titled \"Intimidation Game,\" will see the SVU's detectives get involved in a case after a female employee is assaulted at a gaming convention. Ice-T and friends will help Raina Punjabi, a video game developer facing a barrage of online insults, intimidation, and threats from \"the male-dominated gaming community\" as she gears up to release her first game. The parallels with Gamergate \u2014 a movement that's been tied to  bomb threats , attempts to reveal private information, and  direct death threats against women in games \u2014 are clear.\nLaw & Order: SVU prefaces its episodes with a disclaimer that notes \"the preceding story is fictional,\" but it's certainly not the first time the show, now in its sixteenth season, has lifted from real-world headlines for its inspiration. Viewers will hope Ice-T and his colleagues at the SVU will be able to \"level-up\" to protect the make-believe game developer, but one person \u2014 even one as  multi-talented as Ice-T \u2014 will have a tough time trying to stop the kind of  harassment and abuse real-world women such as Anita Sarkeesian receive  on a daily basis .\n","Title":"Law & Order is sending Ice-T to investigate Gamergate-style harassment | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"6917590"]}
