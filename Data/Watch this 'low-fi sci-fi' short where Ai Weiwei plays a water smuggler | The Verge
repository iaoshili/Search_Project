{"Main text":"Watch this 'low-fi sci-fi' short where Ai Weiwei plays a water smuggler\nCrowdfunded film finally released after spat with Chinese artist\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBilled as a \"low-fi sci-fi\" film, The Sand Storm takes place in a metropolis scoured by a water shortage. The most recognizable member of the cast is arguably Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who plays a smuggler that finds himself tangentially ensnared in the tribulations of the local population. Dialogue is sparse in this bleak Kickstarter success, which never fully explains what is going on in the background\nThe movie saw its share of controversy earlier this year when  Ai publicly denounced the creative team for co-opting his image and involvement as a promotional hook. He also claimed that copyrighted material were used without his consent and requested that the Kickstarter project be taken down. Director Jason Wishnow eventually  issued an apology as well as a promise to de-emphasize Ai's role in the dystopian short. The nine-minute film debuted at the 41st Telluride Film Festival, which took place between 29th August and 1st September, 2014.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
