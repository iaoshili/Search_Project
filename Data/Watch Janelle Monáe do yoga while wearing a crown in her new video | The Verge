{"Main text":"Watch Janelle Monáe do yoga while wearing a crown in her new video\n'Yoga' comes off the upcoming Wondaland Presents: The Eephus EP\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJanelle Monáe is gearing up to release her label compilation Wondaland Presents: The Eephus later this year, and today she dropped its first video. It's for the EP single \"Yoga,\" a collaboration with Jidenna (Monáe's Wondaland Records labelmate) that's literally about yoga.\nThe song is a seductive, rolling anthem propped up by metallic handclaps and a charred, stuttering beat. And the video, which features choreographed dance moves and a diner lit by a candelabra, is pretty solid proof that Janelle Monáe is the only person in the world who can do yoga while wearing a crown.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
