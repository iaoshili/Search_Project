I mean if everyone at school's got this chip and I don't, how am I supposed to communicate?\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month we heard about  BitTorrent's first foray into paid original content with the sci-fi series Children of the Machine, and now we've got our first glimpse of... something related to it. The nearly-six-minute clip, posted to CotM's Facebook page, tells the story of 14-year old Winona from September 2025. Winona's got a chip that lets you be cool in school and talk to people. It also supposedly tracks your whereabouts, but there's an app for that. Oh, and it also gets you high, which the kids those days are calling \"jolting.\" What any of this has to do with her climbing trees and hanging out under a dock by the beach isn't clear. The pilot for Children of the Machine will be available for free this December, followed by seven more episodes if an estimated 250,000 users pay the reported $9.95 fee.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
