{"Main text":"The 9 biggest things from the Apple Watch and MacBook announcement\nIt's about time\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter months of fanfare, Apple finally announced a date for its smartwatch: April 24th. The timepieces are one of the riskiest ventures Apple has made in years, and they\u2019re going to play a big role in either making smartwatches the new smartphones or sending them back to the panels of Dick Tracy. They\u2019re a push towards blending fashion and tech, with customizable bands; multiple models made of steel, aluminum, and gold; and price tags that range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. And they take Apple's personal computing to new, sometimes slightly creepy levels. Or, as Tim Cook put it, \u201CApple Watch is the most personal device we have ever created. It\u2019s not just with you, it\u2019s on you.\"\nUpdate: Read our Apple Watch review .\nBesides the watch, Apple also wrapped up a couple of other long-rumored announcements. While the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro are still around, there\u2019s a new 12-inch laptop known only as the MacBook. It\u2019s absurdly thin and light, and it strips out pretty much everything that\u2019s not a screen, trackpad, or keyboard. And there was a surprise announcement for, of all things, HBO: come next month, you\u2019ll finally be able to watch Game of Thrones without a cable subscription. This wasn\u2019t necessarily Apple\u2019s biggest event, but it was one of the more satisfying ones \u2014 a chance for the company to finally show off some significantly new hardware.\nThe Apple Watch is coming next month\nAs we learned last year, the Apple Watch comes in three models: the Sport, the Apple Watch, and the Apple Watch Edition. The sport is the cheapest, starting at $349 for the 38 mm and $399 for the 42mm. Cases are made from anodized aluminum. The Apple Watch is stainless steel, starting at $549 for the 38mm and $599 for the 42mm, but going as high as $1,099 depending on the band. Finally, the Apple Watch Edition, the 18-karat gold version, starts at a whopping $10,000. Preorders begin on April 10th, and  watches will be available on April 24th .\nThere are a bunch of new watch apps\nThird-party developers have had access to WatchKit tools since November, and today  Apple highlighted the ways watch-based apps would make interacting with real world easier \u2014 summoning a car using Uber, checking in for flights using Passbook, opening garage doors using Alarm.com. The first Apple Watch presentation highlighted health and fitness tracking, but Apple's ambitions there have been scaled back somewhat. The version presented today can monitor the wearer\u2019s activity levels and send a report at the end of the week. There were also some media apps, including Shazam and Instagram, though why you would browse Instagram on such a tiny screen is unclear.\nThe watch has an 18-hour battery, supposedly\nWithout a good battery, a smartwatch is nothing \u2014 they\u2019re supposed to stay on your wrist, not in a dock. But Apple promises that this isn\u2019t going to be an issue with the Apple Watch, because it's supposed to have  an 18-hour battery life . That\u2019s a lot shorter than super-low-power products like the Pebble, and won't necessarily outshine some Android Wear gear, but it\u2019s not bad.\nResearchKit will let you become a medical test subject\nApple's health and fitness system  now includes ResearchKit , a framework created to advance medical research. The kit will include several apps targeted at different diseases, including Parkinson's and breast cancer, essentially turning the iPhone into a diagnostic tool. Users will be able to complete tests and surveys to make it easier for researchers to recruit them for clinical trials. With permission from users, ResearchKit can access data measured by third-party apps about its users' weight, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Some of this was already possible with HealthKit, but now Apple's partners, like Oxford University and Mount Sinai Hospital, will have access to the data. Apple stressed that it will not have access to the data unless it is shared by the user. Five apps are available today, but ResearchKit will be released next month as an open source platform.\nThere's a hyper-minimalist gold MacBook\nAfter a few minor updates, the MacBook Air is getting a long-awaited refresh, and it\u2019s a big one. The new, 2-pound, 12-inch Retina device is just called the MacBook , and as rumored beforehand, it\u2019s about as stripped-down as a laptop can get. The body is now barely wider than the keyboard \u2014 which has also been redesigned with shallower keys \u2014 and there\u2019s a new trackpad with haptic feedback and more gesture support. Virtually every port has been removed except a versatile USB-C connector and a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The fan is gone, and Apple promises nine hours of web browsing on a single charge. And did we mention it now comes in \"space gray\" and gold? Like a lot of Apple\u2019s older products, the Air and MacBook Pro aren\u2019t going away \u2014 they\u2019re both getting a specs bump, and the updated models are available today. The MacBook, meanwhile, is coming out on April 10th for $1,299 and up.\nOne cable for everything\nApple\u2019s new 12-inch MacBook will ditch several ports from its 13-inch MacBook Air in favor of  a single USB Type-C connector . The USB Type-C, a small, reversible connection, started making its way onto phones and tablets this year. This input simplification doesn\u2019t come as a surprise; we discovered in January that Apple had assigned 18 engineers to work on the USB Type-C. You\u2019ll primarily need to use wireless connections to exchange files instead of plugging USB accessories or USB keys straight into the new laptop, though Apple is selling a special cable that splits into a separate charger and data ports.\nHBO is cutting the cord and coming to Apple TV\nApple is helping HBO make a play for cord-cutters with HBO Now, a standalone streaming service announced today. HBO CEO Richard Plepler took the stage to describe the new service, launching in early April, with Apple as an exclusive partner. \"All you need,\" CEO Tim Cook said, \"is a broadband connection and an Apple device.\" HBO will also have a channel on Apple TV. It\u2019s $14.99 a month, with early subscribers getting the first month free. Apple TV's price fell to $69.\nCarPlay is coming to more cars\nTim Cook touted CarPlay\u2019s progress during the event today, saying that it would be coming to 40 new car models this year, and that \"every major\" manufacturer was now signed on. Though the level of commitment among carmakers may vary \u2014 Toyota hasn\u2019t committed to a release timeline, for instance. CarPlay is competing with Google's Android Auto, both of which make phone features easier to use while driving.\nLuxury smartwatches have officially arrived\nOne of the big surprises is the price of the gold watch, the Apple Watch Edition , which starts at $10,000. Going into the event, $10,000 was at the very high end of guesses. It represents a serious move into the luxury market, and will be available in a \"limited select retail stores\" on a special designated table.\n","Title":"The 9 biggest things from the Apple Watch and MacBook announcement | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","apple-watch-spring-event-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7927306"]}
