{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple Pay is coming to select JetBlue Airways flights starting next week, according to  a report in USA Today . Passengers with an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus can purchase food and onboard amenities without fishing out their credit cards starting on transcontinental flights between New York\u2019s JFK and San Francisco and Los Angeles airports. More destinations will be added in March with all JetBlue flights scheduled to support Apple Pay by June.\n\"Somebody else doing it always puts pressure on the other guy.\"\nIf you\u2019ve ever tried making an in-flight purchase with a credit card you\u2019ll immediately recognize the convenience this represents. Not only will it speed up payment processing for Apple Pay passengers, it'll also accelerate the food service for everyone else on the flight.\nJetBlue is the first airline to support Apple\u2019s contactless payment system and certainly won\u2019t be the last. \"Somebody else doing it always puts pressure on the other guy,\" says Apple\u2019s Eddy Cue.\nJetBlue is swapping out older payment terminals with iPad Mini\u2019s equipped with Apple Pay-compatible NFC cases already approved by the FCC. The new iPad terminals also support plastic credit card payments. Later in the third quarter, JetBlue\u2019s own mobile app will support Apple Pay as well. JetBlue's Rachel McCarthy says other contactless payment systems like Google Wallet will be supported \"down the road.\"\nApple Pay is supported by 750 banks and Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. Launched in September, it already accounts for  two out of every three dollars spent via contactless payments for the three major credit cards. It's accepted by a few dozen US merchants including McDonald\u2019s, Walgreens, and Whole Foods, and it recently became useable at some 200,000 vending machines thanks to a deal with USA Technologies.\n","Title":"Apple Pay and JetBlue strike first airline deal | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
