A day after Sony  confirmed it had killed its Music Unlimited service and inked a deal with the Swedish company to bring the music streaming service to PlayStation and Xperia smartphones, RunKeeper has  announced Spotify integration for the iOS version of its fitness app.\nUsers need Spotify premium subscriptions\nRunKeeper's latest 5.2 update, released a few days ago on the App Store, means users with Spotify Premium subscriptions can sign in to their accounts and play music through the fitness app. To access the streaming service through RunKeeper you'll need to download both it and Spotify, before following  RunKeeper's steps for connecting the two apps together. Once set up, users can access their own self-made playlists, or rely on Spotify's existing list of workout playlists to keep themselves motivated while out exercising.\nFor now, this Spotify integration only works with RunKeeper's iOS app, but a spokesperson for the company said that this was only the first phase of the work the two companies planned to do together. RunKeeper says it's exploring Android integration as a part of its next phase.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
