{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile the likes of Amazon and Netflix continue to court major exclusives for their respective services, Hulu earned a big win of its own this weekend. At the Television Critics Association Press Tour yesterday, Trey Parker and Matt Stone announced that all 17 seasons of South Park will be available for streaming on Hulu Plus, with new episodes available for subscribers the day after broadcast.\nAccording to the New York Times , the deal for the series' 240-plus episodes was worth more than $80 million, helping to ensure that the series will live on well beyond its 20th season. Previously, viewers had to rely on Hulu, Netflix, or SouthParkStudios.com, which has up until now provided the complete catalog of episodes (save for a handful of banned episodes). That all changes with this announcement. Also, as part of the deal, viewers can watch every episode of the series for free up until the new season debuts on September 24th.\nHulu is determined to catch up to the competition\nHulu is clearly continuing its bid for more content to catch up to the competition, and this deal is the biggest to date. After spending much of last year on the auction block, the service ordered two new series in the supernatural comedy Deadbeat and the  Seth Meyers vehicle The Awesomes , while also signing deals with the likes of the BBC and CBS. More recently, Hulu made  a deal with Viz Media and Toei Animation to bring Sailor Moon back to the States for the first time in more than a decade.\nUpdate 7\/13 5:50am ET: A previous version of this post stated that SouthParkStudios.com did not have the series' full catalog of episodes. That was incorrect and the article has been updated to reflect the error.\n","Title":"Hulu now has exclusive rights to stream every episode of 'South Park' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
