{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe long-rumored Top Gun 2 is almost certainly happening, at least according to producer Jerry Bruckheimer.  In an interview with The Huffington Post last week , Bruckheimer expressed how determined he is to make a follow-up to the 1986 classic, and hinted at what themes the movie will explore. In the sequel, Tom Cruise will reprise his role as Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, and face off against drones to prove just how essential volleyball-loving airmen are.\nJohn Henry with fighter pilots\nDuring the interview on HuffPost Live, Bruckheimer said he thinks \"we're getting closer and closer\" to making the sequel a reality. Talk about the movie has been bubbling for years, especially after Paramount tapped Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott to  return for another outing in 2010 . The Pirates of the Caribbean producer said that Scott had figured out a way to tell the story right (in what sounds like an action movie take on the John Henry tall tale) but  his suicide in 2012 almost scuttled the project. \"The concept is, basically, are the pilots obsolete because of drones,\" said Bruckheimer. \"Cruise is going to show them that they're not obsolete. They're here to stay.\"\nNeither Cruise nor a director have signed on for the film, so there's no telling when it will be made. However, an announcement of production kicking off seems like the logical next step, however far-off it may be.\n","Title":"'Top Gun 2' will feature Tom Cruise versus drones, says Jerry Bruckheimer | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
