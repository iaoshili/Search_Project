{"Main text":"Two Fifty Shades of Grey movie sequels have been confirmed\nFifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed are in the works\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThat's right: Fifty Shades of Grey has a few more shades on the way. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson announced yesterday prior to an advance screening of the first film that the Fifty Shades of Grey movie will be followed by two sequels,  MTV reports . The other two books in the Fifty Shades trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have both been confirmed for the big screen.\nThat's 150 shades\nWe're still a week away from the first movie's release, but this isn't a surprise.  According to Vanity Fair , Fifty Shades of Grey was the fastest-selling advance ticket for an R-rated movie in Fandango's history, and the book trilogy  managed to outsell Harry Potter on Amazon UK.\nNo word yet on who will be involved with the film, but given that Fifty Shades' current leads, Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson,  probably hate each other , they might not want to do it all over again. And again.\nFifty Shades of Grey will make movie theaters uncomfortably warm on February 14th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
