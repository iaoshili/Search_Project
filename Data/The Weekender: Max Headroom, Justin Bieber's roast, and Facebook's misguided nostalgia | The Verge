{"Main text":"The loneliest roast: Justin Bieber does public penance on Comedy Central\nJustin Bieber has had a bad few years. After a string of high-profile and ugly incidents, Bieber seems to be ready to turn over a new leaf. But, for some reason, Bieber's starting it with a roast that may just be a reminder of how alienated he's become.\nThis mechanical exoskeleton makes walking more efficient\nResearchers have built a boot-like exoskeleton that makes walking more efficient \u2013 no batteries required. The creation could be a big help for the elderly or people with spinal cord injuries, but first the researchers plan to make the exoskeleton capable of doing even more.\nFacebook's new nostalgia feature is already bringing up painful memories\nFacebook's new feature is meant to give you a nostalgia trip by bringing up fun old memories \u2014 expect, it's doing a poor job of filtering out the bad moments that people don't want to recall. Here's how the feature is failing badly after little more than a week.\nThe Meme as Meme\nNautilus\nAbby Rabinowitz examines \"serious meme theory\" and tries to find out what makes something likely to go viral.\nBut trawling the Internet, I found a strange paradox: While memes were everywhere, serious meme theory was almost nowhere. Richard Dawkins, the famous evolutionary biologist who coined the word \"meme\" in his classic 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, seemed bent on disowning the Internet variety, calling it a \"hijacking\" of the original term. The peer-reviewed Journal of Memetics folded in 2005. \"The term has moved away from its theoretical beginnings, and a lot of people don\u2019t know or care about its theoretical use,\" philosopher and meme theorist Daniel Dennett told me. What has happened to the idea of the meme, and what does that evolution reveal about its usefulness as a concept?\nMatter\nMary H.K. Choi details her attempts to escape from the adult world with MDMA.\nHe hands me an Altoids mini tin. Altoids mini tins are the best for exactly this. Three pills for $30 each. They were $20 16 years ago \u2014 which is the last time I paid for E \u2014 and I wonder if it\u2019s just more expensive now or just more expensive for old people. It doesn\u2019t matter. Honestly, I\u2019d be sketched out if the stuff hadn\u2019t taken a 10-buck hike over the last decade and a half. Drugs should cost a lot more than a cocktail \u2014 even one from a froufrou hotel. That seems right to me. Heroin seems wrongly cheap these days.\nWhen Will The NSA stop spying on innocent Americans?\nThe Atlantic\nAn important section of the Patriot Act is set to expire in June, that would take away the NSA\u2019s authority to monitor the calls of American citizens. Conor Friedersdorf reports on what that would look like, and if it\u2019s even possible.\n'The National Security Agency considered abandoning its secret program to collect and store American calling records in the months before leaker Edward Snowden revealed the practice, current and former intelligence officials say, because some officials believed the costs outweighed the meager counterterrorism benefits,' the news organization reported. 'After the leak and the collective surprise around the world, NSA leaders strongly defended the phone records program to Congress and the public, but without disclosing the internal debate.'\nAeon\nMichael Hanlon logically examines how to prepare for the end of the world.\nThe problem is physics itself. Our home \u2013 our planet, our Solar System and indeed our entire Universe \u2013 has a finite lifespan. All that is will be destroyed, either in fire or, as observations suggest now seems more likely, in a lingering, depressing \u2018heat death\u2019. The stars will all go out, and the expanding cosmos will be no more than a colossal, black and freezing void in which nothing of interest ever happens again. The laws of nature insist upon it. Or do they? Human ingenuity has carried us a long way before now. What\u2019s more, any final cosmic calamity is likely to be a very long way into the future. We have time to prepare.\nMotherboard\nArikia Millikan reports on the public's reservations with  an effective and safe form of male birth control.\nMedically, there is a way. It\u2019s been studied in animals and humans for more than 30 years with almost no documented complications. Known as \"the male birth control injection,\" an application called RISUG (Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance) was in\u200Bvented in India in the 1970s by Sujoy Guha, a professor of biomedical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology. It\u2019s affordable, minimally invasive, and fully reversible\u2014and it\u2019s the most effective, non-permanent way of preventing pregnancy (from the sperm side) the world has ever seen, according to studies so far.\nListen to this\n","Title":"The Weekender: Max Headroom, Justin Bieber's roast, and Facebook's misguided nostalgia | The Verge","Tags":["culture","weekender","entertainment"]}
