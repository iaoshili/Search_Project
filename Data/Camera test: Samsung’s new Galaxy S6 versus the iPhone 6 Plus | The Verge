{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung's new Galaxy S6 is the most impressive phone the company has ever made, and a large part of that is thanks to its new camera. It's fast, reliable, and takes great photos. It's easily the best camera on any Android phone ever. But how does it compare to the iPhone 6 Plus, the reigning champ of smartphone photography?\nTo find out, we put the S6 head to head with the iPhone 6 Plus to see how it fared in a variety of situations. As it turns out, the S6 can hang: it's very close to the iPhone in terms of image quality and detail. The S6 shots are a little warmer, but not offensively so, and the two phones handle low-light a bit differently.\nOn the whole, the S6 holds its own against the iPhone, and we wouldn't hesitate for a second to use it as our primary smartphone camera. You can see the comparisons for yourself below. The Galaxy S6 images are on the left and the iPhone 6+ are on the right. All images were shot with auto HDR settings and have been cropped and resized for the web.
