{"Main text":"Mark Zuckerberg started a book club on Facebook because books are good\nHe invited about 30 million pals, too\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhatever your feelings about Facebook, it's hard to argue it's as stimulating \u2014 at least in the same way \u2014 as a good book. Even Mark Zuckerberg might not disagree, apparently, seeing as he's set a challenge for himself: read  a new book every other week through 2015.\nThe reason? Because books are good for you, essentially.  From the announcement post :\nI'm excited for my reading challenge. I've found reading books very intellectually fulfilling. Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today. I'm looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books.\nAnd, refreshingly, that's about it. Zuckerberg likes books; you might like books. Perhaps everyone can read some books together. Zuckerberg created a group, simply called \" A Year of Books \" for anyone hoping to follow along and blasted it out to his 30 million followers. So far, more than 50,000 people have signed up to read the first tome, \"The End of Power\" by Moisés Naím.\nMaybe it's the earnest language, but somehow this is a little humanizing for the Facebook CEO. Who doesn't want to snag a few friends and chat about a good read? Maybe everyone can come over to his place and play with his  very goofy mop-dog .\n","Title":"Mark Zuckerberg started a book club on Facebook because books are good | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
