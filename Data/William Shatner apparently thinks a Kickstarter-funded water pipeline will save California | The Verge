You might start asking yourself that question after hearing the latest idea from the 84-year-old star: a Kickstarter-funded, $30 billion water pipeline to save California from its  devastating drought .\nIn an interview with  Yahoo Tech's David Pogue , Shatner says, \"I\u2019m starting a Kickstarter campaign. I want $30 billion ... to build a pipeline ... Say, from Seattle. A place where there\u2019s a lot of water. There\u2019s too much water.\" He adds, \"How bad would it be to get a large, 4-foot pipeline, keep it above ground \u2014 because if it leaks, you\u2019re irrigating!\"\nYou heard it here first: Seattle has too much water.\nShatner says Seattle has too much water anyways\nIt's not clear if Shatner was just playing around and Pogue is taking this whole thing a bit too seriously. But we sure hope so, because the idea is crazy. Forget about raising that much cash on Kickstarter ($30 billion probably isn't enough, anyways). Building such a pipeline would require the cooperation of communities up and down the West Coast, the purchase of land, and innumerable environmental roadblocks. And you'd have to find a place that would let you take their water. Oh, and by the time all that water got down to California, it'd  probably be far too expensive for anyone to use it \u2014 even more expensive than desalinating ocean water.\nSo what happens if this Kickstarter actually gets online and raises some cash? According to Shatner, \"If I don\u2019t make 30 billion, I\u2019ll give the money to a politician who says, \u2018I\u2019ll build it.\u2019 Obviously, it\u2019s to raise awareness \u2026 so why not a pipeline?\" For all the silliness, then, Shatner does get some credit for at least paying attention to an issue that so few seem to care about.\n","Title":"William Shatner apparently thinks a Kickstarter-funded water pipeline will save California | The Verge","Tags":["culture","science","entertainment"]}
