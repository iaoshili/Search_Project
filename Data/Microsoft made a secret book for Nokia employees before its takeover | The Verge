The 128-page book was edited and illustrated in London before being printed and shipped to employees in more than 90 cities in 53 countries.\nIt\u2019s a celebration of the rich history that Nokia and Microsoft both share, including etchings of Nokia\u2019s origins in a paper mill in Finland and Microsoft\u2019s roots in New Mexico. Illustrations range from the first-ever GSM call to surgeons using the Kinect sensor for operations. Nokia and Microsoft approached TCOLondon in mid-December, with the original plan to have the book ready and finished for February 1st. A later-than-expected acquisition meant the book was delivered to employees at the deal closure in late April . Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even visited Finland to present a copy of the \u201COne\u201D book to Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.
