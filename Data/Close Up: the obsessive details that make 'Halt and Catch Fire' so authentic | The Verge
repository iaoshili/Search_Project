{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe love TV and we love recaps, but a lot of times it\u2019s not the big-picture plot developments that make a show great. It\u2019s the little things; the details of the dialogue, set design, props, and performance. For Close Up, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the coolest moments and most interesting details in some of our favorite shows. We\u2019re kicking things off with the series premiere of Halt and Catch Fire.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of talk about  AMC\u2019s newest drama , and even if you didn\u2019t watch last night, the broad strokes are pretty straightforward: Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace) is a shady IBM salesman who talks his way into a gig at a Texas software company called Cardiff Electric. He\u2019s not just looking for a job, of course, because a guy getting a job selling computers would make for a really boring show.\nJoe\u2019s a three-dimensional chess manipulator, and his big play is to force Cardiff into cloning the IBM PC. To make that happen, he enlists a disillusioned engineer named Gordon (Scoot McNairy) and a manic pixie dream programmer named Cameron \u2014 who seems to be much smarter, and more volatile, than Joe realizes. Halt also happens to be set in 1983, which means there are plenty of interesting things to explore \u2014 when you look at it close up.\nThe long, great tradition of PC thievery\nWhile throwing a dismissive eye towards Joe\u2019s advances, Cameron mentions that technology \"is an industry built on people ripping off each other\u2019s boring-ass ideas.\" She follows it up with a list of names \u2014 SCP, CP\/M, Microsoft \u2014 but what\u2019s she actually talking about?\nLong before  \"Redmond, Start Your Copiers,\" there was a California company named Digital Research, Inc. DRI built an operating system called CP\/M, which ended up becoming a de facto industry standard. Multiple versions were made for various processors, but Seattle Computer Products \u2014 that's the SCP Cameron refers to \u2014 found itself behind the eight ball when it shipped a new product and DRI fell behind on the compatible software.  SCP went ahead and built its own version instead , naming it Quick and Dirty Operating System (QDOS) \u2014 a project that, in the annals of tech lore, is seen as directly ripping off CP\/M.\nMeanwhile, IBM had partnered with Microsoft to get an operating system for its upcoming personal computer. Microsoft bought QDOS to get the job done, but as the story goes it didn't reveal that it was working with IBM \u2014 and got the operating system for a relative steal. QDOS went on to become PC DOS when provided by IBM, and MS-DOS when purchased from Microsoft \u2014 and once PC clones became commonplace, Microsoft's dominance was on.\n'Byte Magazine'\nOne of the things that convinces Joe that Gordon is the right guy to partner with is an article he wrote for Byte magazine, a hugely influential computing publication in the 1970s and \u201980s. In the show, Gordon\u2019s article was published in the February 1979 issue, where  readers at the time could have taken a look at some of these gems:\n\"Build a computer-controlled security system for your home.\"\n\"Designing a robot from nature.\"\nThe Byte classifieds, which include a call for \"Wild and Crazy Assembly Programmers.\"\nThe \"What\u2019s New\" section, featuring the 5.25-inch Apple Disk II floppy drive: 116 KB of storage for $495!\nCOMDEX\nStanding in the parking lot, trying to fire up Gordon after getting turned out by the bosses, Joe screams praise at him: \"I was at Comdex two years ago! I saw the Symphonic demo! It was ahead of its time!\" In the \u201980s, Comdex was the premiere show for personal computing, a predecessor to CES. Short for Computer Dealers Exhibition, it was started by the Interface Group, which was, amazingly, partially owned by everyone\u2019s favorite scooter-riding Super PAC superman, Sheldon Adelson. The show stopped in 2003; by then it was a pretty serious geeks-only event, but when Halt takes place it would have been the place to see the kind of work these two were churning out.\nVintage product placement: Dr Pepper\nWhen we first meet Gordon he\u2019s getting out of the drunk tank, but when he switches to soda his beverage of choice is Dr Pepper. Originally created in Texas \u2014 a fitting selection, given the show\u2019s setting \u2014 good ol\u2019 Dr Pepper actually beat Coca-Cola to market way back in 1885. It\u2019s also infinitely better than Coke\u2019s knock-off Mr. Pibb (though let\u2019s be honest; if you\u2019re in a pinch, Mr. Pibb is still way better than either Coke or Pepsi) .\nWe counted three different moments where the vintage Dr Pepper can makes an appearance: when Donna comes home to find Gordon hanging out at the house, amidst the technological chaos of the Reverse Engineering-athon, and when Gordon fixes his daughter\u2019s Speak & Spell (where he actually takes the can apart, True Detective-style). If you\u2019ve spotted more, drop them in the comments below \u2014 and let\u2019s just hope the horrible old Mountain Dew logo doesn\u2019t show up in future episodes.\nThe tunes of the times\nFirstly, if anyone knows what song Cameron is listening to in the opening scene, please tell us in the comments. She\u2019s obviously hella punk and listening to something raging, but that little clip wasn't enough to clue us in. Later, towards the end of the episode, Cameron is in the arcade playing Centipede again using her trick quarter. She\u2019s got her Walkman and she\u2019s listening to The Vandals. A SoCal punk band, they had just formed when Halt takes place. \"Wanna Be Manor\" is the first song off their first EP, Peace Thru Vandalism, released in 1982. The band is still around, 35 years later .\nGordon, on the other hand, is more mainstream. Sulking in the house, of course drinking a Dr Pepper, he puts on \"Lodi\" by Creedence Clearwater Revival. The lyrics: \"Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play \/ I came into town, a one night stand, looks like my plans fell through \/ Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again.\" Lodi is a small town in California or, for the purpose of this scene, a metaphorical land inhabited expressly not by his computer wizard dreams but strictly by his domestic life. Stuck in Lodi forever, it seems. Drink up, Dr Pepper.\nWhat did you think of the first episode of Halt and Catch Fire, and what were some of your favorite details?
