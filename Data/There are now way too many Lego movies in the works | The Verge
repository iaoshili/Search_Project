Unfortunately, as is often the case, Hollywood is really going to beat the franchise into the ground until we're all sick of it.  According to The Hollywood Reporter , Jason Segel and Drew Pearce are co-writing and co-directing yet another Lego film, this one entitled The Billion Brick Race. This will be the first foray into directing for both: in addition to his acting, Segel has expanded into writing recently with The Muppets, The Five-Year Engagement, and Sex Tape. Pearce is best known for writing Iron Man 3; he's also working on a currently untiled Sherlock Holmes sequel.\nThis means that there are now a whopping four Lego-based films in the works: Ninjago (2016), The Lego Batman Movie (2017), The Lego Movie 2 (2018), and The Billion Brick Race. That's an awful lot of Lego, and there's a good chance that audiences could be pretty tired of the universe before long if things continue at this rampant pace.\nMaybe we'll get a bit of a reprieve, though \u2014 there's currently no planned release date for The Billion Brick Race. THR described the project as being in the very early phases, and the original story's plot details are being kept strictly under wraps. It seems a safe bet that there will be brick-based race cars involved, though. If Warner Bros. can find the strength to space Brick Race out a bit from its upcoming three-year Lego blitz, maybe audiences won't get too burnt out.\n","Title":"There are now way too many Lego movies in the works | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
