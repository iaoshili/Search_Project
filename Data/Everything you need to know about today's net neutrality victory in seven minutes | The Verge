{"Main text":"Everything you need to know about today's net neutrality victory in seven minutes\nStrong new rules with solid legal footing\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis morning the FCC voted 3-2 along party lines toÂ  approve new rules that enshrine the concept of net neutrality. Blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization were all explicitly banned, and the FCC extended its authority to cover the world of peering and interconnection, something companies like Netflix had been asking for.\nThe vote will likely result in new legal challenges from internet service providers.

The battle has been won, but the war is far from over.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
