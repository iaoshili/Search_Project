{"Main text":"The Droid Turbo's insane battery has already been eclipsed by this Chinese phone\nThe suitably named Marathon M3 comes with a 5,000mAh battery inside\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAnnounced by Verizon a week ago, the  Droid Turbo is basically a Moto X with every spec turned up to 11, which in the case of the battery means a massive 3,900mAh cell that's expected to last a full 48 hours before needing a recharge. Unimpressed by that engineering feat, a Chinese manufacturer is already stepping beyond the Turbo's numbers with the launch of a new Android 4.4 handset that is powered by a 5,000mAh battery. The Marathon M3 from Gionee has just been  released in India at a price of 12,999 rupees (roughly $210) and manages to fit that enormous battery within very reasonable dimensions. It measures 10.4mm in thickness and has a 5-inch display, promising phablet-like endurance without the associated bulk.\nTargeting the price-sensitive Indian market has led Gionee to sell out with the one big spec in the battery and go relatively frugal with the rest: the processor inside the M3 is a quad-core MediaTek chip, there's no LTE connectivity, and there are only 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage available.\nHey Motorola, Samsung, LG, Sony: You see what the Chinese are doing? 5,000 mAh battery, 10.4 mm phone, 5\" display. http:\/\/t.co\/RXsEHJqHGP\n\u2014 Stefan Constantine (@WhatTheBit) November 6, 2014\nThe Marathon M3 is unlikely to ever make its way to western shores, but it does pose the intriguing question of why more established brands in the mobile market aren't pursuing similar strategies. Of all the specs inside our mobile devices, the only two left that matter are the camera and the battery, and with the latter bigger is universally better.\nMotorola Droid Turbo Hands-On\n","Title":"The Droid Turbo's insane battery has already been eclipsed by this Chinese phone | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
