{"Main text":"Iggy Azalea attacks Papa John's on Twitter after driver hands out her number\n#brands, take note\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile you were watching the Grammys last night, something far more important was brewing on Twitter. Well before the award show even began, Iggy Azalea was beefing with #brands. Pizza brands, actually. According to the Fancy performer, a Papa John's driver had handed her personal phone number off to his family members. Naturally she was upset:\n@PapaJohns I ordered a cheese pizza but instead I got tons of calls and messages like this one. pic.twitter.com\/fgKhydivXb\n\u2014 IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 8, 2015\nThings had already gotten ugly.\n@PapaJohns and this is all your supervisor has to say about it #ProfessionalAsFuck pic.twitter.com\/kyQMWQADSq\n\u2014 IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 8, 2015\nWouldn't you, fellow non-celebrity, be pissed off? The incident thus called for a immediate response on Papa's part:\n@iggyazalea #We should have known better. Customer and employee privacy is important to us. Please don\u2019t #bounce us!\n\u2014 Papa John's Pizza (@PapaJohns) February 9, 2015\nSure, take responsibility and throw in some levity. Privacy is an important matter in these trying times, but, hey, Papa John's is full of fans! They even listened to that song one time. See? More branding!\nA40&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;5jBqg\" frameborder=\"0\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\nIggy was not amused. (Her mood perhaps worsened by the fact thatÂ  she went home awardless .)\n@PapaJohns I don't think data breach is funny. I expect you to contact me to explain how you are going to rectify your breach\n\u2014 IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 9, 2015\n@PapaJohns of my personal information in a satisfactory and professional way or lawsuit will be filed.\n\u2014 IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 9, 2015\nThe temerity! Papa John's is tampering with her data! (Not really, but we get why she's upset.) Restitution must be made! We imagine the driver in question is on his way to being fired if they haven't been already, though the company hasn't issued any official statement. This isn't exactly good PR for the chain. Iggy might even swear off delivery pizza for good, taking her fans with her!\n@DiGiornoPizza I know right!\n\u2014 IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) February 9, 2015\n(Or the more legitimate issue that Iggy might be stalked by someone who could put her life in danger.) Let this be a lesson to you, brands of the world. If a problem arises online, fix the issue and then engage.\n","Title":"Iggy Azalea attacks Papa John's on Twitter after driver hands out her number | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
