{"Main text":"Frankenstein, Dracula, and more could return in classic monster movie reboots from Universal\nBeginning in 2016 with 'The Mummy'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSuperhero movies have been all the rage in Hollywood, but Universal Pictures has more or less been left out of their success. It now has an idea for what might come next, though: monsters.  According to Deadline , Universal plans to bring back its classic monsters \u2014 which include Frankenstein, Dracula, and The Mummy \u2014 in a big way. It's brought on two blockbuster writers to begin creating a connected universe for Universal's monsters, which will begin to show up in a series of rebooted films.\nWriters behind 'Fast & Furious' and 'Transformers' will oversee the new films\nUniversal has already been at work on a reboot of The Mummy for April 22nd, 2016, and Deadline reports that it will be the first in this new series of monster movies. A Van Helsing reboot has also been in the works for several years, and  Variety reports that it too will be part of this new monster slate.\nWriters Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan will be in charge of ensuring that Universal's series of monster films are a hit. You may not be familiar with those writers' names, but Kurtzman and Morgan have each been behind quite the series of hits: Morgan wrote five Fast & Furious films, and Kurtzman has been behind blockbuster movies like Transformers and huge TV shows like Fringe. It's not known if either Kurtzman or Morgan will be writing any of the monster films themselves, but they will be in charge of creating an overarching narrative for the pictures and ensuring that they're put together in a consistent manner. Universal has rebooted several of these characters before, but this would be the first time that it began putting them all together.\nUniversal's plan is clearly still in the early stages of development, but with the short timeframe that Deadline lists, it's possible that we'll be seeing more soon should things pan out. And if the films succeed, we may just end up seeing the revival of other classic characters, like The Wolf Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.\n","Title":"Frankenstein, Dracula, and more could return in classic monster movie reboots from Universal | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
