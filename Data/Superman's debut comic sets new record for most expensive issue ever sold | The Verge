{"Main text":"Superman's debut comic sets new record for most expensive issue ever sold\nBreaks record by over $1 million\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAn issue of the comic containing Superman's debut appearance has  sold for $3.2 million at auction, taking the record for the most expensive comic sold to date by over $1 million. The comic, Action Comics #1, received a 9 out of 10 quality rating from the Certified Guaranty Company, and it's believed to be one of potentially just 50 other unrestored copies still in existence, with very few of such high quality. The issue was first sold for 10 cents in 1938.\nIf this story sounds familiar, that's because this is far from the first time that a copy of Action Comics #1 has taken the title of most expensive comic. The previous record holder was actually another copy of this same issue, having sold for $2.16 million back in 2011 (that particular copy is believed to have  a storied history , supposedly having been stolen from Nicolas Cage, serendipitously recovered and returned to him over a decade later, and later sold to another party.) That copy is said to have had a 9 CGC rating too, however it apparently had off-white pages, unlike the copy sold today. Back in 2010, another copy of Action Comics #1 took the record  after selling for $1 million .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
