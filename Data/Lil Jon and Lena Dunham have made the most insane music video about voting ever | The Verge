{"Main text":"Lil Jon and Lena Dunham have made the most insane music video about voting ever\n#TURNOUTFORWHAT\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSince Diddy's \"Vote or Die\" campaign never had a music video component (South Park parody notwithstanding), #TURNOUTFORWHAT wins the award for \"most insane video about voting\" without much competition. Part of the long-running  Rock the Vote campaign, the video itself is a pep rally for getting people to register and turn out for the November 4th midterm elections. And because Lil Jon is only known for two things \u2014 the song \"Get Low\" and yelling \"What\" or \"Yeah-uh\" (as popularized by Dave Chappelle), that's all here in abundance.\nWe've also got: \"Auntie\" Whoopi Goldberg, \"Lil Lena\" Dunham sharing a polling booth with Tracy Anderson (and Lil Jon having very specific questions about Girls season four), Fred Armisen in a dance battle with a ladder.\nIn case you're wondering:  \"What's up it's Lil Jon and I'm turning out for the legalization of marijuana.\" Hopefully he's  registered to vote in Alaska, Oregon , or the  District of Columbia .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
