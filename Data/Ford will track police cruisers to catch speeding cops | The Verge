{"Main text":"Ford will track police cruisers to catch speeding cops\nThe LAPD has outfitted 50 Interceptor models with new systems that can monitor driving behavior\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou've probably seen a police cruiser or two barrel down the road without an apparent suspect in sight and wondered, who, exactly, you could call to complain. To improve public safety \u2014 and hopefully introduce more accountability into the system \u2014 Ford will beginning tracking cruisers with the Los Angeles Police Department. If an officer is driving recklessly, their supervisors will know about it in real time.\nFord Telematics for Law Enforcement\nFord, with help from a California-based company called Telogis, has already outfitted 50 LAPD cruisers with transmitters that send driving information back to headquarters: a supervisor can track for speeding, sudden breaking or accelerating, if airbags have deployed \u2014 even if the officer is wearing a seatbelt. The system's calledÂ Ford Telematics for Law Enforcement, and it's being installed on Ford's Police Interceptor variations of its Explorer and Taurus models.\nAfter the Los Angeles test run, Ford could make the transmitter available to other police departments next year \u2014 one potential reason for law enforcement using other companies' cars to jump ship \u2014 and possibly install it on other LAPD vehicles. How subordinates on the force respond to being tracked \u2014 that's something we'll have to wait to see.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
