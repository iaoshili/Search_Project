{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDeadline reports that Fox is trying to put all the pieces in place for a revival of The X-Files, the long-running sci-fi series (and occasional rom-com) following the adventures of Fox Mulder and Dr. Dana Scully. The biggest challenge, apparently, is not interest from all the key parties \u2014 Mulder's David Duchovny, Scully's Gillian Anderson, and series creator Chris Carter would participate \u2014 but rather scheduling problems: everyone is wrapped up in other projects, and Duchovny and Anderson are both presently starring in shows on other networks.\nThe problem is getting everyone's time\nThe original series ran for nine seasons (several without Duchovny's participation) and led to two films, the most recent of which was released in 2008. It's unclear exactly what form a new X-Files could take, but Fox may simply be riding high off the success ofÂ  24's recent return .\nFor fans of the show, I think we can all agree that the most recent movie, I Want to Believe, was not the best way to tie a bow on the franchise. Another season or two with Carter's guiding hand \u2014 hopefully with The Lone Gunmen* \u2014 could help atone for that film's misses.\n*Vox Media support manager Chao Li reminds me that The Lone Gunmen died, but they're The Lone Gunmen \u2014 anything is possible.\n","Title":"The X-Files could be coming back | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
