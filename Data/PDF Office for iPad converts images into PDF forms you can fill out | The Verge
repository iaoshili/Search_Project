{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe PDF, Adobe's age-old ubiquitous file format, isn't the most interesting thing in the world, but it's a common thing that many people have to deal with in some form or another during their workday. Viewing PDFs on an iPad or other mobile device is easier today than it was years ago, but creating, modifying, and annotating them can still be quite a chore. There are already a ton of apps for the iPad that let you do just that, but today  productivity app maker Readdle is releasing  PDF Office , which it promises to be the most advanced of them all.\nPDF Office for the iPad lets you create new PDFs or work with already existing documents. Its most powerful feature is the ability to scan an image of a document and convert it into a PDF form with fillable text boxes in just seconds. You can also import images, graphs, text, signatures, and more into PDF files. Readdle already offers an app for reading and viewing PDFs called PDF Expert, but PDF Office is targeted towards those that need full PDF editing and creation abilities on their iPads.\nTake a picture, make a PDF form\nReaddle is offering the app through a subscription plan \u2014 the first for the company \u2014 that costs $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year. Existing owners of PDF Expert 5 will receive a year's subscription to PDF Office for free. The company plans to offer PDF Office on other platforms in the future, but its first release is limited to the iPad for now. PDF Office will be available for download from the iTunes App Store starting today.\n","Title":"PDF Office for iPad converts images into PDF forms you can fill out | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","tech"]}
