{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung hasn't officially shared full pricing details on the Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge, but T-Mobile is giving us a pretty good indication of what you'll pay out of pocket for the former. The Uncarrier is holding  a Galaxy S6 giveaway for customers who pre-register for more details on Samsung's new flagship. Four lucky people will get a Galaxy S6 at no cost, but in setting up its contest, T-Mobile has also revealed the phone's unsubsidized price. The S6 is listed as having a prize value of $699.99, and it's likely that T-Mobile is giving away the 32GB model.\nUpdate: Read the  Galaxy S6 review .\nA wiser buy than any 16GB smartphone\nSo if you're going on price alone, yes, it'll be possible to get an iPhone 6 for less than what you'd pay for a Galaxy S6. But outside of education and maybe the enterprise, we'd never recommend Apple's 16GB base-model devices; that's just not enough room for your stuff in 2015 \u2014 even if the bulk of your media is stored in iCloud, Dropbox, Spotify, Netflix, and so on. Samsung's had the good sense to go with 32GB for its entry-level Galaxy S6, which could also be meant to appease customers upset about losing microSD card support. Remember also that the S6 features a larger, higher-res screen.\nSince there's no such thing as a 32GB iPhone 6, the unsubsidized Galaxy S6 slots in right between the 16GB ($649) and 64GB ($749) iPhones. That's assuming this price is accurate. (There's a good chance it is, since a mistake wouldn't thrill the IRS.) Then again, we're still in a world where Verizon and AT&T customers care most about on-contract pricing, and there, you can probably expect the GS6 to land somewhere around $199 \u2014 with the Galaxy S6 Edge and its curved display demanding a higher premium.\n","Title":"Samsung's Galaxy S6 will probably start at $699 off contract | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
