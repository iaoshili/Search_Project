{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHTC has just sent out invitations for its big event at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, identifying March 1st as the day on which we'll see \"what's next\" from the Taiwanese company. A starry sky, highlighted by a single burst of light, is captioned with the teasing phrase \"utopia in progress,\" giving us the first hints at what to expect. With this year's CES being a quiet time for mobile announcements, MWC is shaping up to be a particularly big show and HTC is the first from among the major Android phone makers to set a date and time for its next big launch. While HTC itself isn't disclosing any further information, the timing and the grandiose tagline make it all but a certainty that this March 1st event will host the unveiling of the next One smartphone launch.\nThe current flagship device from HTC, the One M8, launched in March of last year and marked a change for the company with an aggressive schedule of almost immediate retail availability. If HTC sticks to the same plan this year, we could be a mere six weeks away from not only seeing but actually owning the next One. Beyond the company's smartphone refresh, there's also potential for HTC to debut one or more of the wearable devices it's been working on  with Under Armour . Now keen to be known as a  personal tech brand that builds more than just smartphones, HTC has also promised to enter more unusual device categories like home entertainment, details of which should be revealed by the end of 2015's first quarter.\nVerge Video Archives: Designing the New HTC One M8\n","Title":"HTC's next One flagship smartphone set to launch on March 1st | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","breaking","tech","mwc-2015"]}
