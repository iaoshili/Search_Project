{"Main text":"Fly from Tokyo to San Francisco in 83 seconds with this gorgeous timelapse\nFaster than the Concorde\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOver 5,100 miles of ocean separate Tokyo from San Francisco, a journey that ordinarily takes air travelers over 9 1\/2 hours to complete. But imagine if the trip could be done in a little over a minute: that's the effect created in a new timelapse video from  YouTube user psp747 . Said to be compiled from over 3,400 still images taken during the course of a flight, the video shows clouds whipping underneath at an incredible rate and the sun setting and rising over the horizon. The backing track, \" A Courageous Light Instrumental ,\" comes by way of musician Adam Michaels. It's certainly not the first aerial timelapse, but it is almost enough to make you forget the headaches associated with most commercial flights these days (delays, layovers, security, etc.)\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
