{"Main text":"How to incubate a parasitic fly under your skin\nThis is the grossest thing you'll see all day\nEntomologists aren't like you and me; they're way more comfortable with truly disgusting stuff. Which is why not one but two entomologists recently announced that they had incubated parasitic bot flies under their skin. On purpose.\nBot flies are \"relatively painless unless the larva decides to munch on nerve endings\"\nBot flies are parasites. First, a female bot fly chases down a mosquito and lay eggs on its belly. Then, when the mosquito gets its next blood meal, the eggs hatch and the tiny larvae drop onto the skin of the animal below, where they burrow in head-first. The bot fly, as a foreign object, inflames the immune system, sending white blood cells to the site \u2014 which the larvae use as snacks. Over the course of about 10 weeks, bot fly larvae grow from the size of a grain of sugar to that of a peanut, writes Piotr Naskrecki , one of the bot fly incubators, and an entomologist at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, at Harvard University. This process, as you might expect, is weird for the host, but \"relatively painless,\" Naskrecki writes, \"unless the larva decides to munch on nerve endings.\"\nThe bot fly is a relatively \"friendly\" parasite, according to Gil Wizen, the other bot fly host. \"It does not transmit any  diseases, does not cause any significant damage to the body, does not  leave any scars, keeps its area clean from infections by antibiotic  secretions and most importantly \u2013 unlike other parasites, once it  finishes doing its thing, it leaves on its own!\" he writes in his account of incubating the larvae. This was his second try; his first didn't go so well for the fly .\nOnce the fly is big enough, it drops out of its host's skin and forms a pupa. The adult fly emerges, but can only live for a few days, since it has no functioning mouth \u2014 and can't feed. Both Naskrecki and Wizen deemed their progeny pretty. \"And what a magnificent fly it is!\" Wizen writes. \"Glowing red eyes, a pointy head with a  bright silvery 'face,' and the most dazzling blue abdomen, striking  with metallic gloss. For me, this was literally the miracle of birth. No  matter how I look at it, this fly is my own flesh and blood.\" Parents, am I right?\nIn both cases, the scientists were accidentally infected in Belize \u2014 bot flies range from Central through South America. As interesting as the experiment was, Naskrecki writes, he'll make sure he's covered in insect repellent the next time he's in Belize.\n","Title":"How to incubate a parasitic fly under your skin | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","science"]}
