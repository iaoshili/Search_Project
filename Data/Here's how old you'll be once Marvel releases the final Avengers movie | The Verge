{"Main text":"Here's how old you'll be once Marvel releases the final Avengers movie\nYou'll have dedicated a lot of time to watching superheroes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMarvel now has release dates for the remainder of its third phase of superhero movies, culminating with Avengers: Infinity War, Part 2 on May 3, 2019. At the time of publication, that's four and a half years away. Many of these movies don't have directors, cinematographers, or screenplays attached. Marvel doesn't care. Marvel is a machine that intends to operate into the not-so-distant future, and it's staking that claim by penning its releases into our shared mental calendar.\nSo how old will we be when this final movie in the third phase is released? I'm cautious to say Infinity War will be the final Marvel movie all together, because comics never die. And how much time will we have spent watching all of these films? To help you out, my colleague Ryan Mark designed a helpful app that provides an answer. It's posted above.\nOne note, before you look at the relentless lurch of time itself: this app takes into consideration the 20 Marvel movies that will be released between Iron Man in 2008 and Avengers: Infinity War, Part 2 in 2019. It does not include Marvel superhero movies not produced by Marvel, including the Spider-Man movies from Sony and the X-Men movies from 20th Century Fox. And it absolutely does not account for the films from DC Comics and Warner Bros.\nNow that we have those details clarified, let's gaze into the sands of time and consider how life passes us by with each release of a new superhero film. When this series started, I had just graduated from college. When it ends, I'll be 33 years old. Exhale the existential sigh.\n","Title":"Here's how old you'll be once Marvel releases the final Avengers movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
