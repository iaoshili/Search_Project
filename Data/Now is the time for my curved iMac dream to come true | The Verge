{"Main text":"Now is the time for my curved iMac dream to come true\nForget curved TVs, curved computers and monitors are the future\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI\u2019ve wanted a curved iMac ever since I first saw Nuno Teixeira\u2019s concept back in 2008. What was impossible back then is quickly becoming the norm now. Samsung announced its first curved all-in-one PC just three weeks ago, and this week LG announced its own . And this is only the beginning. That\u2019s great if you\u2019re a PC, but I\u2019m a Mac , and pretty much locked into Apple\u2019s whims at this point.\nHaving just returned from CES, curved TVs are very much a thing for 2015. In 2014 they were rare, but now almost all of the big TV makers \u2014 Samsung, LG, Sony, and Hisense \u2014 are selling curved televisions. Everyone but Vizio, of course, which is eschewing the curve to mock its competition . And while flat is the right TV answer for everyone but the self-engrossed bachelor, a curved computer monitor or all-in-one PC is something else entirely.\nTV makers want you to believe that curved televisions allow for a more immersive viewing experience with an improved sense of depth, amongst other lofty claims about minimized distortions and reflections. But this is the same cabal that tried to upsell the world on 3D in order to entice a new wave of purchases. Maybe there\u2019s some benefit for people that live alone and like sitting just a few feet away from their 50-inch LCD. That\u2019s not me, I have a family. I do, however, sit alone, often for hours, at just a few feet from the center of my iMac\u2019s display. That puts me at the sweet spot for a curved monitor or AIO.\nSamsung's 34-inch 21:9 curved monitor completely and utterly sold me on the idea\nLast week I managed to try a Samsung Ativ One 7 all-in-one PC. It was kind of ugly and kind of plasticky, and it kind of ran Windows on a 27-inch 1920 x 1080 display. The experience wasn\u2019t great, but I could see the benefit of sitting directly in front of a curved display. Seeing Samsung\u2019s 34-inch 21:9 curved monitor with 3440 x 1440 resolution up close, however, completely and utterly sold me on the idea. It was more immersive, and it did seem to reduce reflections. But really, it was just so damn cool-looking.\nAnd guess what? LG has a similarly specced 21:9 curved monitor, and it\u2019s also one of the suppliers for Apple\u2019s iMac Retina 5K panel. While the LG and Samsung monitor panels pale in comparison to the the 5K iMac\u2019s 5120 x 2880 resolution, they improve upon the 27-inch iMac\u2019s 2560 horizontal pixels while matching the 1440 vertical pixels.\nLet\u2019s be clear, I don\u2019t have any insider information on Apple\u2019s plans. All I know is that the industry is trending towards curves and Apple hasn\u2019t had a substantial all-in-one design change since the iMac G5 was launched in 2006 (and then switched to aluminum in 2009).\nI want those pixels wrapped around me where I can see them\nOf course, what I really want is to have one 34-inch iMac flanked by a 34-inch monitor of equal resolution. Hell, as long as I\u2019m making wishes, let\u2019s toss in a second monitor for a continuous curve of three displays in total! At that size (and at my age) I want those pixels wrapped around me where I can see them, not way off in the distance along a continuous straight line.\nIt\u2019s from here, from this futuristic command center, where I\u2019ll be able to do future-y things like, like\u2026 oh hell, the same things as today, but at least it\u2019ll feel like progress.\n","Title":"Now is the time for my curved iMac dream to come true | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","essay"]}
