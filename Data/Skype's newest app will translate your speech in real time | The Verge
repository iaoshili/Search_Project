As part of a preview program, Skype Translator makes it possible for English and Spanish speakers to communicate in their native language, without having to learn a new one. It sounds like magic , but it\u2019s the result of years of work from Microsoft\u2019s research team and Skype to provide an early working copy of software that could help change the way the world communicates in the future.\nSkype Translator Preview works on Windows 8.1 or preview copies of Windows 10, and it works by translating voice input from an English or Spanish speaker into text and translated audio. An English speaker will hear a translation from a Spanish speaker, and vice versa.Â  Microsoft previously demonstrated the technology working between English and German, but Spanish will be the only language outside of English that will be initially supported during the preview.\nA big test for Skype Translator in the real world\nMicrosoft is marketing Skype Translator as a tool for schools, and the company tested it out with students in the US and Mexico. Skype is already popular in the classroom, with teachers participating in video conferences around the world to connect their schools to classrooms across the globe. While tests and demonstrations have been in limited and controlled experiments, Microsoft\u2019s move today opens up its Skype Translator to a much wider audience to test it in the real world.\nMicrosoft is also translating instant messaging conversations through Skype Translator, with more than 40 languages supported. If you\u2019re interested in testing Skype Translator then you\u2019ll need to request an invite at Microsoft\u2019s Skype site , and using registration code STVER4230 may help you get an invite a little quicker.\nVerge Video Archives: I Typed Text With My Thoughts (Top Shelf, Season 3, Ep. 1)\n","Title":"Skype's newest app will translate your speech in real time | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
