{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs if the Road Runner's uncanny ability to defy physics wasn't troubling enough, Wile E. Coyote also had to struggle with countless mishaps at the hands of the Acme Corporation's reliably unreliable weapons, wearables, and contraptions. His comic struggle was celebrated by  Ian Frazier's 1990 New Yorker fiction piece , \"Coyote v. Acme,\" which dramatized the opening statements of the almost-inevitable lawsuit between the two parties. Now the prolific design firm Pentagram is taking a deeper dive into the invented lawsuit with a close look at some of the peculiar products sold to the Coyote.\nOne of Pentagram's designers, Daniel Weil, has  created a series of technical drawings for Acme products that may just be included in such a suit as supporting evidence. Weil details a rocket sled, rocket skates, spring-powered shoes, a bomb, and a tiger trap, all of which Pentagram says are designed carefully enough that they should functionally work \u2014 even if you may want to be wary of using them. The cartoons might imply that there's some matter of fault from both parties, but with Weil's designs in hand, it may become more evident which party takes the bulk of it.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nWeil's designs and Frazier's story were printed in a booklet meant to resemble a legal brief.\nThe prints were created for Pentagram's annual holiday card. As you've probably have gathered, they're a bit more elaborate than most.\n","Title":"Wile E. Coyote v.
