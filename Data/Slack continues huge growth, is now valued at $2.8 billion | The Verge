{"Main text":"Slack continues huge growth, is now valued at $2.8 billion\nNot bad for an enterprise messaging platform\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSlack, the fast-growing chat and enterprise collaboration tool, has announced that it recently raised $160 million in new funding, and the company now has a post-money valuation of $2.8 billion.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the completed funding round back in March, but today Slack has officially confirmed the latest evidence of its meteoric rise in the workplace. Not bad for a messaging platform that publicly launched with nary a peep in February of last year.\nIt was only October when Slack  shared its last funding news ; at that time, the company had just raised $120 million from top-tier Silicon Valley investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. They're all part of the new, bigger $160M round, but others have also joined in, including Horizons Ventures, Digital Sky Technologies, Index Ventures, Spark Capital, and Institutional Venture Partners.\nThe big valuation is one thing, but Slack is also releasing new numbers today that provide important updates on actual user growth. Over 750,000 people are using the app daily, and Slack says it's so far got over 200,000 paid seats. In both cases, that's double where things stood at the beginning of 2015. By most measures, Slack is already doing incredibly well, and that momentum only seems to be growing stronger.\n","Title":"Slack continues huge growth, is now valued at $2.8 billion | The Verge","Tags":["apps","business","tech"]}
