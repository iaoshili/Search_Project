{"Main text":"Netflix makes it easier to recommend your favorite shows to friends\nFirst, you need to connect to Facebook\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix just unrolledÂ  a social recommendation feature that will make evangelizing your favorite shows far easier. To use the new function, you'll need to first connect your account to Facebook before you can select your friends from a row of pictures. Netflix will then allow you to add an optional personal note before it relays your suggestions.\nWhile the first step is necessary for anyone looking to pass on recommendations, recipients won't need to go through the same procedure. Those who have not linked their social media accounts to Netflix will receive endorsements in the form of Facebook private messages. The new feature can be accessed from the website, iPad, iPhone, PS3, Xbox, various set-top boxes, and smart TVs.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
