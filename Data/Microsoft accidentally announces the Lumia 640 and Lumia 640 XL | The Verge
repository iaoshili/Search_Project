{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is holding a press event at Mobile World Congress tomorrow morning to announce new Lumia devices, but that\u2019s not stopping the software maker from revealing things a little early. Microsoft\u2019s news center accidentally published a blank article announcing the Lumia 640 and Lumia 640 XL, two new Windows Phone devices. Rumors have suggested Microsoft is launching two new low-end devices, and the numbering scheme appears to indicate that\u2019s the plan.\nThe Lumia 640 XL is presumably a bigger version of the Lumia 640, and it appears Microsoft is dropping part of its confusing numbering scheme in favor or the simplified XL moniker.  Leaked specifications suggest that the Lumia 640 will be a 5-inch device with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage, all powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 400 processor. The same leak also claims that Microsoft is placing an 8-megapixel camera at the rear of the device and a 1-megapixel camera at the front. Little is known about the Lumia 640 XL, but many expect the company to unveil a Lumia 1320 successor, so it\u2019s likely to be bigger than the 5-inch Lumia 640 model.\nThe Verge will be  covering Microsoft\u2019s press event tomorrow morning from 2:30AM ET, so stay tuned for more coverage of Microsoft\u2019s Lumia plans.\n","Title":"Microsoft accidentally announces the Lumia 640 and Lumia 640 XL | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tech","mwc-2015"]}
