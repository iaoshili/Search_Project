Modiano will receive an award of 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million), and with today's announcement, becomes the 11th French author to win the prize for literature.\nMemory is a recurrent theme throughout Modiano's works, as is the city of Paris, where he grew up and currently resides. Much of his writing is of an autobiographical nature, and some of the same characters and storylines are woven throughout his novels. Other works are set within the German occupation of France during World War II, including Dora Bruder and the film Lacombe Lucien, which he made together with French director Louis Malle in 1974.\nModiano isn't a household name outside of France, though several of his books have been translated into English, including Honeymoon, Ring Roads: A Novel, and Villa Triste. His latest book, Pour que tu ne te perdes pas dans le quartier, was published this year.\n","Title":"Patrick Modiano wins Nobel Prize in literature for his work on 'the art of memory' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","us-world"]}
