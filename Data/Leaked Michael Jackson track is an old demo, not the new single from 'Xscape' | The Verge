A similar process was used to create 2010's Michael, which also featured unreleased material. One reviewer  called that album \"kind of enjoyable\" but warned that \"if this decent-enough album is the best of the bunch, things are going to get ugly from here on in.\"\nSony and Motown Universal seem determined to keep squeezing music out of Jackson's oeuvre\nSlate pointed to an earlier appearance of the track from a Jackson impersonator  showing off his dancing skills on YouTube , noting that the track didn't sound like the updated version  Epic Records teased last week .\nSony and Motown Universal seem determined to keep squeezing music out of Jackson's oeurvre, though.
