{"Main text":"Giant new species of lethal jellyfish discovered in Australian waters\nKeesingia gigas are gargantuan members of the Irukandji jellyfish family\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nScientists have discovered a new venomous creature in the waters off Western Australia's coast,  according to The Guardian. Named after the scientist who captured the first-known specimen, the arm-long Keesingia gigas is an enormous member of the extremely venomous Irukandji jellyfish family. The tiny box jellyfish normally measure about a cubic centimetre (less than 0.1 cubic inch), and are infamous for being able to cause the eponymous Irukandji syndrome, which if untreated can lead to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure.\nThe Guardian reports that there is something unusual about the potentially dangerous Keesingia gigas: every photograph and specimen that has been found lack the signature tentacles. Marine Stinger Advisory Services director Lisa-ann Gershwin believes it might be purely coincidental. \"I think more probably it does have tentacles but by random chance the specimens that we photographed and obtained don\u2019t have them any more,\" she says, after positing that the Keesingia gigas might be capable of shedding its extremities in self-defense.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
