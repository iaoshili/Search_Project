{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFans waiting for the theatrical release of Veronica Mars on March 14th now have a few more ways to watch the series' return. According to The Wall Street Journal , the film will also be available to rent and download at the same time as its cinema debut. The move breaks the long-standing \"theatrical window\" rule that typically governs when major movies are available for home viewing.\nVeronica Mars will be distributed on 270 screens across the country, a much bigger outing for what might otherwise be considered an indie effort. Warner Bros. has opted to rent 260 theaters from AMC to show the Kickstarter-backed film , giving the studio the freedom to give it a unique simultaneous release. \"On projects like this where we know we have a partner with the resources to promote the film and an easily targetable audience, we will rent theaters out,\" Nikkole Denson-Randolph, AMC's vice president of special and alternative content, told the WSJ.\nDon't expect studios to change their business models just yet\nThat's certainly a boon for fans who might want more flexibility in how they plan to watch the movie, and it's real vindication for the series itself. However, don't expect the likes of Warner Bros. to change their business models too soon. With movies like The Lego Movie now pulling in more than $200 million in global sales , studios have all the incentive in the world to keep theater and home distribution for bigger flicks separate for the time being.\n","Title":"'Veronica Mars' will launch in theaters and online at the same time | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
