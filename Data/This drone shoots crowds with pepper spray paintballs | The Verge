{"Main text":"This drone shoots crowds with pepper spray paintballs\nSkunk Riot Control Copter will be deployed to South African mines\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCrowds of protesters could soon come under attack from riot control drones outfitted with paintball guns, strobe lights, and speakers.  The Skunk Riot Control Copter , built by South African company Desert Wolf, has a suite of cameras and four paintball guns strapped to its chassis to help its operators monitor and control unruly crowds. The guns can fire ammunition from four different hoppers, meaning the drone operators can shoot protesters with dye markers, solid plastic pellets, or small capsules of pepper spray.\nDefence Web says that a full drone system \u2014 including high definition and thermal vision cameras, the eight-rotored drone itself, and a ground control station \u2014 will cost around 500,000 South African Rand ($46,000). The device is controlled by two people: a pilot, and a payload operator who controls the drone's suite of weaponry. These operators will be monitored on duty by camera and microphone, an activity that Hennie Kieser, Desert Wolf's director, says will ensure they aren't too aggressive.\nThe four mounted paintball guns can use pepper spray ammunition\nThe first batch of drones will reportedly be deployed to mines in South Africa later this month, where  lengthy strikes at some of the country's biggest facilities  have resulted in violence . Mine owners hope that the drones will be able to control and subdue their workers by blasting them with flashing lights, blaring messages of control, and shooting them from the sky. Kieser says he hopes its success in the country will lead to more orders for the gun-toting drone.\n","Title":"This drone shoots crowds with pepper spray paintballs | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","tech"]}
