{"Main text":"The UK is about to unleash a 'fart machine' on France\nColin Furze plans to install a valveless pulse jet inside an enormous butt\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA British inventor is preparing to let rip the loudest fart that France has ever heard. In order to accomplish this mission,  Colin Furze put together a valveless pulse jet, a propulsion device sometimes used by hobbyists to power model aircraft and other remote-controlled vehicles. Next, he's building a gigantic pair of human buttocks to house his machine. Furze intends to have his absurd contraption prepared by July 24th, which is when he plans to unleash auditory hell from the cliffs of Dover, England.\nAmazingly, Furze's upcoming stunt is far from his most outrageous. The plumber turned YouTube celebrity has created a  multitude of other inventions including a jet-powered bicycle, the  world's fastest mobility scooter, and a pair of magnetic shoes designed for walking on the ceiling.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
