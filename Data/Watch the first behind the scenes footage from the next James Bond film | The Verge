{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJames Bond has returned. Daniel Craig's 007 makes his first appearance in Spectre, the 24th James Bond movie, in behind-the-scenes footage from the set released tonight. The clip shows Craig punching people and firing guns, while production staff and his co-stars are interviewed high in the Austrian mountains.\nCraig will be joined on the mountainside by co-stars Léa Seydoux and Dave Bautista, who goes from a stint as Guardians of the Galaxy's Drax to a role as the bearded Mr. Hinx. The footage shows the filming of a car chase across snowfields that associate producer Gregg Wilson says will be one of the major action sequences of the movie. The action seems to take place around a remote base high in the mountains, a suitably Bond-ish location that gives Daniel Craig a beautiful backdrop against which to murder goons.\nThe movie's  called Spectre , so named for the sinister organization that featured in Ian Fleming's original Bond novels, and in early Bond movies such as Dr. No. SPECTRE has been the center of copyright disputes between Fleming and screenwriter Kevin McClory that kept it out of a number of Bond movies, but \u2014 as of 2013 \u2014 a settlement has been agreed with McClory's estate, clearing the way for Bond's biggest enemies to return to the screen.\nThe group \u2014 its spooky moniker stands for Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion \u2014 is also notable for relying on sharks to kill off Sean Connery's James Bond in Thunderball. Given the grittiness of the Daniel Craig-era movies, it seems unlikely that the world's greatest supervillains will use the same tactics again.\n","Title":"Watch the first behind the scenes footage from the next James Bond film | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
