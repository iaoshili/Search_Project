{"Main text":"The new 'Interstellar' trailer is fantastic, but you need this secret key to watch it\nChristopher Nolan takes viewers to another world\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDirector Christopher Nolan says that Interstellar will have  the grandest scope of any film that he's made yet, and we're starting to get a good look at just how far into the universe the movie will really go through its latest trailer. You won't be able to watch the trailer  outside of Interstellar's newly launched website though, and even there it's hidden behind a passcode. To get through, you'll have to enter the code \"7201969,\" as in, the date that Apollo 11 landed on the moon.\nWhile earlier clips largely kept the film's star, Matthew McConaughey, down on Earth, this latest one takes him out into space and onto what appears to be another gorgeous, desolate planet. The movie is scheduled for a release on November 7th, and you can read our writeup of Nolan's surprise discussion of the film at Comic-Con  right here .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
