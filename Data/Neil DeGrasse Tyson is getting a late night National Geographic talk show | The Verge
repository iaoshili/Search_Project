Today the National Geographic Channel said that it's tapping Tyson for what will be its first late night series, called Star Talk. According to a release about the new program, obtained by The Wrap , it's going to be a lot like Tyson's podcast , which has been running since June 2009 :\nBased on Tyson's incredibly popular podcast of the same name, the new series will bridge the intersection between pop culture and science as it brings together celebrities, comedians and scientists to discuss the latest developments in our vast universe.\nThe weekly program airs in April and will be taped in front of a studio audience at the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium, Nat Geo says. No word yet on who the first guests or topic will be, but Tyson generally has a lot to talk about with just about anyone, including Twitter at large.\nWouldn't it be cool if Zombies & Vampires became human if we bit them first? Somebody needs to test that hypothesis.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) January 5, 2015\nTyson's first and only season of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, aired on Fox last May and ran 13 episodes. The program was an ambitious reboot of the 1980 TV series by astronomer Carl Sagan and would run on Nat Geo the day it aired on Fox.\n","Title":"Neil DeGrasse Tyson is getting a late night National Geographic talk show | The Verge","Tags":["culture","science","entertainment"]}
