{"Main text":"The 'Deadpool' movie is coming February 12th, 2016\nHappy Valentine's Weekend\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt looks like that  leaked Deadpool test footage \u2014 and the positive reaction from fans \u2014 has dragged the movie back from development hell. 20th Century Fox, home of the X-Men and Fantastic Four movie franchise, just announced that the Deadpool movie is really, truly happening. At least, it has a release date \u2014 February 12th, 2016 \u2014 leaving about 16 months film and edit it.\nAccording to  The Hollywood Reporter , original director Tim Miller is still attached to the project while \"no deal is set\" for long-attached star (and avowed Deadpool fan) Ryan Reynolds. We're pretty sure he'll say yes. Original writer \/ producer Rhett Reese took to twitter in celebration:\nDeadpool fans, you retweeted your support, now RETWEET in CELEBRATION! Movie on its way!!! http:\/\/t.co\/qt7boTCAnl\n\u2014 Rhett Reese (@RhettReese) September 18, 2014\nAs did Deadpool creator Robert Liefeld:\nCrazy stuff happens when you leave the house for the first time in a week!!! DEADPOOL in Feb. 2016!!! Woo-ya!!!\n\u2014 robertliefeld (@robertliefeld) September 18, 2014\nIn related news, Fox pushed Fantastic Four back two months, from June 19th, 2015 to August 7th. (Assassin's Creed, which originally had that date, is currently not on the release calendar.) And as far as we know,  X-Men: Apocalypse is still set for a few months after Deadpool on May 27, 2016.\nAlso due out in 2016? Warner Bros'  Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (March 25th), Marvel Studio's  Captain America 3 (May 6th) and  Doctor Strange (July 8th), and Sony's Spider-Man spinoff  Sinister Six (November 11th).
