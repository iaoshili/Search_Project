{"Main text":"Armando Iannucci is leaving Veep after season four\nDavid Mandel of Curb Your Enthusiasm will take over\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSeason four of HBO's Veep doesn't premiere until tomorrow night, but showrunner Armando Iannucci has already announced this season will be his last. The decision was made, at least in part, so Iannucci could spend more time with his family in London,  The Hollywood Reporter reports . David Mandel, who worked as an executive producer and writer for Curb Your Enthusiasm, will take over.\n\"Armando is not replaceable but we are confident that Veep will continue to be produced at the highest levels with new showrunner David Mandel,\" an HBO rep said in a statement to THR.\n#VeepHBO returns Sunday. Our best season yet.Time for me to quit airports. I'm leaving on a high and kissing goodbye to jet-lag.\n\u2014 Armando Iannucci (@Aiannucci) April 10, 2015\nVeep without Iannucci doesn't seem like Veep at all, but the deranged faux-mance between Julia Louis-Dreyfus' VP and Tony Hale's bag man is probably enough to carry the show for years. Veep hasn't been renewed yet, but at this point, a fifth season seems likely.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
