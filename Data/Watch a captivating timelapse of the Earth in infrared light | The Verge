{"Main text":"Watch a captivating timelapse of the Earth in infrared light\nProduced by two geostationary NASA satellites\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFrom November 30th, 2014 to January 26th, 2015, two geostationary satellites, GOES 13 and GOES 15, captured images of the Earth in infrared light. Now James Tyrwhitt-Drake,  a student of advanced microscopy, has  created a timelapse of it .\nTyrwhitt-Drake downloaded the images from the satellites' multispectral, infrared-capturing channels, pulling 700 frames from the 27-day time period. The clip shows a mind-boggling kaleidoscope of water vapor shifting in the atmosphere, shot from 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth. The animation might seem to be moving slowly, but keep in mind as you watch: the timelapse plays at a rate of 21 hours per second.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
