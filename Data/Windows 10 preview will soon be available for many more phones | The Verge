That's soon about to change.  Microsoft has announced a second round of devices that will be able to run the very latest builds of Windows 10, and the good news is that the list has expanded considerably. The bad news is that there are still a few notable absences, including the Lumia 930 and any HTC Windows Phone devices.\nLumia 930 not yet supported\nOf course, you should still sit down for a minute and consider if you really want to install the Windows 10 Technical Preview on your phone. If your Windows Phone is your daily driver, it's probably not a good idea \u2014 the operating system is still rough around the edges. Dual-SIM features are still severely lacking, and Messaging lacks, search, message drafts, voice notes, spam filters, support for multiple attachments,  and other features . In addition, Cortana only speaks English and Internet Tethering will break your phone if you don't turn it off before powering down your device.\nThe next Windows 10 build will likely come out next week \u2014 below is the preliminary list of all the devices it will support.\nLumia 1020\n","Title":"Windows 10 preview will soon be available for many more phones | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5910988"]}
