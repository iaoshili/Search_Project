{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\"I was bored with everything being static in my visual world,\" artist Anthony Howe told The Creators Project about his new work \u2014 a series of so-called \"kinetic sculptures.\" These kinetic sculptures are hardly static \u2014 thanks to the wind, they move in mesmerizing patterns that The Creators Project described as \"real-world screensavers.\" Beyond the visual spectacle, Howe's design process is a combination of modern technology and traditional metalwork processes. His pieces start as computer models that he designs with the CAD program Rhinoceros 3D, and then the designs are cut with a plasma cutter and assembled by hand. That 3D design process is crucial to the wild visual effects found in his finished work \u2014 it allows him to see how the sculptures will move before he goes through the work of actually building them.\nHowe puts his work through a pretty rigorous process to make sure it'll stand the test of time, as well. \"I try to overbuild my work,\" he says. \"The best way to test it is to bolt one of the sculptures to my Ford F-150 and drive down the freeway.\" Still, much of his designs appear to be best suited to a low wind which leads to the slower, hypnotic motion that defines much of his work. \"Anything will work in a 50-knot wind, you know... just put a piece of metal out on the table and it'll blow away, that's kinetic,\" Howe says. \"But to make it spin at about one knot, that's harder.\" To see Howe's work in motion, check out the video from The Creators Project below \u2014 and visit Howe's site to see all of his work. And if you want to see it in person, Howe's bringing his biggest creation to Burning Man next year: it'll be 30 feet wide, 30 feet deep, and 25 feet high and will require an 18-wheeler to get out to the festival.\n","Title":"Watch Anthony Howe's hypnotic 3D art go from conception to reality | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","design"]}
