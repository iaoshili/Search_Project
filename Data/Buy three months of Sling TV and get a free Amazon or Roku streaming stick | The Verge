{"Main text":"Buy three months of Sling TV and get a free Amazon or Roku streaming stick\nOr get $50 off a Roku 3 or Fire TV set-top box\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBack when Dish made its grand  announcement of Sling TV at CES , the company teased it would be offering bundles that package the internet TV service with popular streaming devices. And today, it's revealed what those are. If you're willing to prepay for three months of Sling TV (which adds up to $60), you'll be eligible to  receive $50 off an Amazon Fire TV or Roku 3 set-top box. But if you don't want another box beneath your TV, you can instead opt for a free Fire TV Stick or Roku Stick. The tiny HDMI dongles offer most of the same streaming apps as the set-top boxes, but aren't quite as powerful and miss out on potentially important home theater features like optical audio. But the choice is entirely yours.\nSling TV just launched its apps for Amazon's streaming hardware today. So it's a pretty smart time for the companies to team up in hopes of boosting sales on the software side with Sling subscriptions and moving more Fire TV boxes and Sticks out the door. The Roku 3 remains our top pick if you're looking for the best living room streaming experience, though you'll have to  order that from Sling directly ; same goes for the Roku Stick. On Amazon's end, you'll be emailed a promotional code after paying for three months of Sling TV; just apply that to your Fire TV purchase and you'll be good to go. The fine print notes that this offer is available only to new Sling TV subscribers, so if you've already jumped on Dish's service, it might be too late. Promotional codes must be used by June 5th.\n","Title":"Buy three months of Sling TV and get a free Amazon or Roku streaming stick | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","good-deals","tech"]}
