{"Main text":"'Game of Thrones' season five will go on without Hodor\nBut look! Rave of Thrones!\nThe good news: next season's Game of Thrones will have one less storyline to juggle. The bad news: it's the one with Hodor and Bran Stark. (Caution: minor spoilers ahead.)\nIn an  interview with Yahoo , actor Kristian \"Hodor\" Nairn confirmed that he's got the year off:\n\"We have a season off and we have a year's hiatus, solely because I imagine our storyline is up to the end of the books... So, I get my year off now to do Rave of Thrones and gallivant all over the world.\"\nIndeed, as  SlashFilm points out , there really isn't much else to the Bran \/ Hodor adventures on paper \u2014 at least, not until  George RR Martin publishes the next A Song of Ice and Fire novel . Still, it's sad to see the writers didn't just find a random excuse to check in on the dynamic duo.\nOh, and  Rave of Thrones is real . Nairn played his first show last week in Sydney:\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
