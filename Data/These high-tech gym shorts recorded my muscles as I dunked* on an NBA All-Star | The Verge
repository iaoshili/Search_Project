It claimed to have taken electromyography, a technology commonly used in hospitals and professional training centers, and made it into something small, wearable, and inexpensive.\nLast week I got the chance to try out  Athos' first product, a pair of shorts . They have 16 sensors embedded throughout to track my muscles, and a bluetooth \"core\" that communicates with the app. You pay $199 for the core, which can then be attached to any of the company's shorts or shirts, each of which retail for $99.\nAll the gear was comfortable, and I didn't notice the technology at all. The app worked in real time and I could actually understand and learn from the data it gathered. I tested it out at the  Mandell School in upper Manhattan with a little help from Jermaine O'Neal, a 6'11'' six-time NBA All-Star , who is an investor in Athos.\nFor now Athos is best suited to measuring static weight lifting exercises where you do a series of repetitions, but electromyography has the potential to look at all kinds of interesting activity in your body, from muscle exertion and lactic acid levels to heart-rate and oxygenation. Athos seems like the first step on the path to smart clothes that will feel no different than ordinary apparel, but will be able to provide a wealth of valuable data on how well your body is working and why.\n* All Verge dunks were performed on a 7-foot-high hoop. No NBA All-Stars were genuinely posterized in the making of this video.\n","Title":"These high-tech gym shorts recorded my muscles as I dunked* on an NBA All-Star | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech","verge-update\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"sbnation"]}
