{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nT-Mobile's about to put a bigger focus on business customers. At today's Uncarrier 9.0 event, CEO John Legere announced a simple lineup of plans targeted at business customers that package unlimited talk, unlimited text, and 1GB of LTE data to start. Businesses can cover 10 lines for a total of $160 a month, and Legere said that companies with more than 20 employees will pay $15 per line. Under that model, 100 lines would start at $1,500 per month. T-Mobile is saying the new plans are up to 40 percent cheaper than rival offerings from AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Move up to over 1,000 lines, and the per-line cost drops to $10, a move that T-Mobile's COO Mike Sievert claimed to be \"unprecedented.\"\nBusinesses can choose to purchase more data on a per-line basis, but it can also be added on with pooled configurations. For companies that do elect to buy more data, T-Mobile will provide a free .com domain through a new partnership with GoDaddy. Similarly, they'll also receive a .com email account powered by Microsoft. Business customers will also be eligible to extend a discount of up to 50 percent to their family members.\nVerge Video archive: John Legere's strangest moments from Uncarrier 5.0 (2014)\n","Title":"T-Mobile announces 'Uncarrier' plans for businesses | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
