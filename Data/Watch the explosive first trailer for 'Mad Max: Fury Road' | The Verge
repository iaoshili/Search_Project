A first look at the film was show on stage, and now that trailer has been released online for the rest of the world to watch. It's an explosive look at the film in all the right ways, and it shows that series director George Miller, who's back on board for Fury Road, still knows exactly what fans want to see out of its apocalyptic world.\nThe movie is \"almost a continuous chase\"\nThe film, which Miller calls \"almost a continuous chase,\" extends the story of the first Mad Max film, but it's not necessarily within the canon of the rest of the series. \"Of course it's based on the same character that they'll play, the lone warrior in the wasteland disengaged from the rest of the world,\" he said in a press conference. \"But naturally Tom brings his Tom Hardy-ness to it, and the story is different to some degree. The character is different to some degree.\" Hardy's Max will be joined by Charlize Theron, playing a warrior known as Furiosa.\nMiller said that his post-apocalyptic film will deal with some of the same issues as its older counterparts. \"In many ways we're sort of doomed to repeat the whole history,\" he said. The Road Warrior, to some extent, was inspired by the oil crisis of 1973, when an embargo by oil-producing Arab countries led to shortages and rationing. \"People effectively went to war for oil,\" he said. \"We arguably have been fighting oil wars ever since. Now, in some places in the world, there are water wars.\"\nThe film, in development for over a decade, was originally intended to star Mel Gibson, but after long delays, a younger Hardy was cast in the role of Max. It's finally scheduled for a release on May 15th, 2015.\nJacob Kastrenakes contributed to this report.\n","Title":"Watch the explosive first trailer for 'Mad Max: Fury Road' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","sdcc-2014"]}
