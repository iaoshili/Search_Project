It's an area in which Nikon has lagged behind \u2014 Canon introduced touch capability to its line of Rebel DSLRs back in 2012.\nIn just about every other way, the D5500 isn't much more than an iterative follow-up to 2013's D5300. (Nikon skipped the D5400 name in this line for some reason). It uses the same 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor that's found in the previous version, can shoot up to 5 frames per second, and uses a 39-point autofocus system. Like in the D5300, Nikon has also obfuscated the use of a low-pass filter, which trades the ability to keep ugly moiré at bay but allows for sharper detail in images.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nNikon finally catches up to the competition with touch controls\nIn addition to the new DSLR, Nikon has also announced two new Nikkor lenses. The first, a telephoto zoom, is the AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-200mm VR II (f\/4.5-5.6). It's outfitted with three different stops of image stabilization as well as Nikon's Silent Wave Motor technology (which quiets the auto-focusing mechanism). It's meant to be an affordable second kit lens, an entry-level option that can extend the reach of an entry-level user's kit to 200mm.\nThe second is a telephoto prime, the AF-S NIKKOR 300mm VR (f\/4), which the company bills as the \"world's lightest 300mm full-frame fixed focal length AF lens.\" It's 1.5 pounds lighter than Nikon's previous version which \u2014 combined with four and a half stops of image stabilization \u2014 should help minimize camera shake, a common problem with longer telephoto lenses.\nThe D5500 will be available in early February and will retail for $899.95, or $999.95 with Nikon's standard DX 18-55mm kit lens.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Nikon announces the D5500, its first ever touchscreen DSLR | The Verge","Tags":["photography","photo-essay","tech","ces-2015"]}
