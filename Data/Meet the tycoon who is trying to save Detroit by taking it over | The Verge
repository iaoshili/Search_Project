{"Main text":"Meet the tycoon who is trying to save Detroit by taking it over\nDan Gilbert, owner of Quicken Loans, has bought 60 buildings in the Motor City since mid-2010\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDan Gilbert is 52 years old. He owns Quicken Loans, America's largest online mortgage lender, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. He alsoÂ  now owns 60 buildings in Detroit totaling 9 million square feet, a staggering private takeover of the city's infrastructure that he began just over three years ago. The New York Times Magazine looks at Gilbert and the other Detroit optimists, who believe that the Motor City's hard fall as one of America's most-populous and economically prosperous cities over the past two decades has finally reached its bottom. The piece is packed with riveting facts not only about these individuals and their auspices, but the city itself: only 35,000 of Detroit's 88,000 total streetlights work right now, for example \u2014 but citizens are installing their own to replace them. Through it, we find that Detroit has become a fascinating test bed for a new kind of radical privatization. For those who call the city home, the stakes couldn't be higher.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
