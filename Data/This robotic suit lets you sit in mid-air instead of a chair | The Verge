{"Main text":"This robotic suit lets you sit in mid-air instead of a chair\nThe Chairless Chair could give assembly line workers a rest\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFactory workers who do rote work through long shifts risk developing back pain or other problems, and a Swiss company called  Noonee has developed a solution: the \"Chairless Chair,\" an exoskeleton for your legs that lets you sit at the push of a button.\nThe aluminum and carbon fiber exoskeleton only weighs about four pounds, so when workers wear the device \u2014 still in the prototype phase, although Audi and BMW are trying it out \u2014 they can move regularly. But, on command, the chair stiffens, giving the workers a spot to rest wherever they are.\nYou wouldn't be wrong to wonder why the Chairless Chair is better than a regular chair. According  to the company , it saves the floor space that chairs would occupy, and in fact works better than real chairs, since it keeps the back straight. Whether workers would prefer it to your standard furniture, though, is another question.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
