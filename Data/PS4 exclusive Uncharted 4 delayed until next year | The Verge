{"Main text":"PS4 exclusive Uncharted 4 delayed until next year\nA huge game misses the holidays\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne of the biggest PlayStation 4 games won't be launching this year. Sony has announced that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End has been delayed and will be hitting the PS4 in spring 2016. It was originally slated to launch some time in 2015.\n\"This game deserves every bit of the attention to detail, precise pacing, and nuanced storytelling Naughty Dog is known for,\" says Neil Druckmann, the studio's creative director. \"So we've made the difficult choice of pushing the game's release date. Giving us a few extra months will make certain that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End not only meets the team's high standards, but the high standards that gamers have come to expect from a Naughty Dog title.\" While it's been in the works for some time, we just got our first glimpse of the game in action  at the end of 2014 .\nSony recently announced that  the PS4 had crossed 20 million units sold as of March 1st, and while that's impressive, without a new Uncharted, the company will be missing out on one its biggest selling points during this year's holiday season. Microsoft, meanwhile, will be releasing perhaps its biggest exclusive this year,  when Halo 5 hits the Xbox One later this fall .\n","Title":"PS4 exclusive Uncharted 4 delayed until next year | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
