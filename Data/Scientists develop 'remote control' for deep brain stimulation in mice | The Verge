This wireless deep brain stimulation technique could help reduce tremors in people who have  neurological illnesses like Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nother techniques require a brain implant and a power source\nDeep brain stimulation isn\u2019t new \u2014 but this technique sure is. In the past, researchers have done it using short pulses of electricity, and they\u2019ve had very promising results. People with Parkinson\u2019s disease saw a reduction in the amount of tremors they experienced, for instance. But the treatment isn\u2019t very accessible; it requires brain implants, which usually need to be connected to a power source. This means that the procedure tends to be used as a last resort.\nIn the study, researchers delivered a genetically modified virus into the brain of mice; the virus causes heat sensitivity in specific neurons. Then, the scientists injected magnetic tiny ion oxide particles into their brain tissue and exposed them to an external magnetic field. This caused the particles to heat up and stimulate the neurons.\nCredit: Ritchie Chen and Polina Anikeev\nThe particles mostly stayed where they were they were injected, the researchers say, which means that humans who suffer from neurological diseases might be able to receive this treatment for up to a month. They also don\u2019t seem to interact with the brain tissue unless they\u2019re heated, the researchers report. Still, this was a preliminary mouse study, which means that the technique needs to be tested a number of times before it can be used on humans.\nTo make the process easier, the researchers developed nanoparticles with precise sizes and shapes. They also made a device that makes delivering a magnetic field more efficient. They now plan to try to use recordings of neuron activity and mouse behavior to get a better idea of what\u2019s going on in the brain when they activate the magnetic field.\n","Title":"Scientists develop 'remote control' for deep brain stimulation in mice | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
