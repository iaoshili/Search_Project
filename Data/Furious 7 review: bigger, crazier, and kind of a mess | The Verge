{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMy love for the Fast & Furious franchise cannot be contained. It knows no bounds. It is an unstoppable, almost supernatural force that has led me to marathon the entire six-movie set more times than I can count. For God\u2019s sake, I co-host a dedicated Fast & Furious podcast.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone. Granted, my obsession may run a little deeper than it does for most, but the progenitor of this series is now 14 years old; today, there are teenagers who have quite literally grown up with Dom, Brian, and the gang. Obviously, at its most basic level, each new Fast film is a high-budget ode to street racing and explosions \u2014 but this has also now become a telenovela for the movie-going set. Once every year or two, we check in on the Torettos, the O\u2019Conners, and their perfect little slice of LA. We want to know how they\u2019re doing. Mia\u2019s baby must be getting big now!\nThe downside to this kind of mad devotion to Vin Diesel\u2019s kingdom of steel and testosterone, of course, is that disappointment is a substantial and ever-present risk. And never has anticipation for a Fast & Furious film been greater \u2014 both for me personally and for the movie-going population at large \u2014 than it has ahead of the release of Furious 7. There\u2019s certainly some morbid fascination around the tragic mid-filming death of Paul Walker and how his central character of Brian O\u2019Conner would be handled, but there\u2019s also the simple reality that this is a Fast & Furious joint. They always get bigger, crazier, more deliciously absurd. Considering the precedents set by Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 , it\u2019s a tough benchmark to beat.\nThe bigger they are, the harder they fall.\nFurious 7 picks up after the events of Tokyo Drift, tracking the crew\u2019s search for vengeance after the death of one of their own \u2014 Han \u2014 at the hands of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Deckard, in turn, is the brother of Fast 6\u2019s fallen bad guy Owen Shaw. Basically, everyone wants to kill everyone else.\nNo one would've pegged the making of Furious 7 as an easy task\nBut it\u2019s a mess from the start. Clearly, no one would\u2019ve pegged the making of Furious 7 as an easy task after Walker\u2019s death, and there was also a delicate dance needed to untangle the series\u2019 1-2-4-5-6-3-7 chronology. Indeed, there are moments where director James Wan \u2014 a newcomer to the franchise whose prior credits are almost exclusively horror films \u2014 seems to have been palpably buried by the enormity of the task that lie before him. The entire first third of the movie almost continuously trips over itself, as Wan and the writers seemed hell-bent on setting up (and, in some cases, glossing over) a laundry list of relatively minor plot points and callbacks, perhaps in an overwrought attempt to tie off storylines haphazardly and with minimal effort \u2014 and to satisfy fanatics like me. We go on a whirlwind tour of moments in Fast lore past and present, visiting (the still unfortunately named) Race Wars for a fleeting instant and the streets of Tokyo Drift for another. It\u2019s as if Wan\u2019s mission was to treat every character and every scene from previous films as a touchstone to be collected in Furious 7\u2019s vast satchel.\nA grab bag of characters from past and present\nThe grab bag of bit characters includes Hector, Elena, Twinkie, Sean, and even Owen Shaw, none of whom really contribute anything \u2014 they\u2019re just there. (Hector\u2019s only purpose, for instance, is to be punched by Michelle Rodriguez\u2019s Letty.) And if none of those names mean anything to you, God help you: I think Furious 7 is the first film in the series that makes no effort to be atomically approachable. You have to know the backstory for it to make any sense, full stop. If you\u2019re just there for the sweet action sequences, sure, I hear you \u2014 but any attempt to untangle the countless relationships that have developed over the course of six previous movies without having seen them recently enough to remember them will fail.\nI sound ungrateful, but believe me: I appreciate the thought behind Wan\u2019s effort to cover all of this nostalgic ground in a little over two hours. It just doesn\u2019t work; it doesn\u2019t cohere; I felt strangely disengaged with these characters that I had learned to love over a decade and a half. I just wanted something to sink my teeth into, but Wan rarely gives the viewer an opportunity.\nAnd in what little time we have for actual character development, we get practically none. Ramsey, a conveniently attractive computer hacker and literal caged damsel-in-distress, serves little function but to enforce tropes and incite an array of cringeworthy lines and camera angles. Yet she was in the movie long enough that it feels odd to know so little about her.\nThe movie does eventually settle into a series of awesome action sequences\nKurt Russell\u2019s \"Mr. Nobody\" comes and goes with even less fanfare; the character basically functions as a narrator to explain what\u2019s going to go down in the next action sequence. (My colleague Ross Miller, seated next to me, described him as a \"Call of Duty menu system.\") And speaking of action sequences, Furious 7 does eventually settle into a series of them \u2014 protracted and higher-budget than ever \u2014 which is really what you paid your $20 or whatever to see. This is the bread and butter not just of this film, but of the entire series, especially since the heady post-Tokyo Drift days. Key moments of each of these sequences were spoiled by trailers, but there\u2019s still enough additional meat in the movie to get you riled up, possibly throwing a fist in the air on occasion and screaming \"hell yes\" with a giant smile across your face. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I did, just that you may feel compelled to do that, and you should feel okay about it.\nAnd maybe that\u2019s what Furious 7 needed more of: as much as I liked seeing Hector for nostalgia\u2019s sake, I didn\u2019t need to see him for a few fleeting seconds in a Race Wars scene barely a few minutes long. Perhaps I was spoiled by the adrenaline-soaked perfection of 5 and 6, where the action never stopped, we got precisely the correct amount of touchy-feely team interaction, and we didn\u2019t care that runways were 30 miles long because we were young and innocent and everything was perfect with the world.\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that the last four films were all directed by Justin Lin, whose deft touch for the franchise was sorely missed here. Lin\u2019s unapologetic love for over-the-top explosions was just as honed as Wan\u2019s, but he did a far better job taking our hands and leading us through each film, building characters and relationships along the way. (And his hype-building post-credit scenes were legendary. Furious 7 has none.)\nJustin, when you\u2019re done with your 'True Detective' adventure, come back\nJustin, when you\u2019re done with your True Detective adventure, come back. James Wan, please return to the Saw series, because the first one was your magnum opus.\nAs for the handling of Walker\u2019s death, without spoiling it, I\u2019ll only say that it left me as unsatisfied as most of Furious 7\u2019s mindless vignettes. The strategy seemed strangely rushed and poorly thought-out, considering the additional production time that was allotted to rewrite the script. In the inevitable Fast 8 \u2014 the screenwriters will still have a bit more work to do to fully explain O\u2019Conner\u2019s (and, in all likelihood, Mia\u2019s) absence.\nIt\u2019s entirely possible, of course, that my fandom has simply blinded me to Furious 7\u2019s greatness. The action sequences \u2014 particularly Abu Dhabi, with the supercar leaping between buildings \u2014 are legitimately phenomenal, and the scenes filmed after Walker\u2019s passing, in which his brothers stepped in for him , were never distracting or even noticeable without looking closely. Maybe I\u2019m missing something. The early reviews are extremely positive, and Rotten Tomatoes is closing in on 90 percent. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic; maybe nothing short of a four-hour marathon with 45 minutes of heart-pounding Race Wars would\u2019ve fit my bill.\nSee it on opening weekend when the theater is thick with hype\nAnd if Furious 7 deserves credit for one thing, it\u2019s closing (or at least trying to close) some doors from the past that make way for new ones to be opened. Vin Diesel says that the next movie will be set in New York, a marked departure from the series\u2019 deep LA roots. And Lucas Black (Tokyo Drift\u2019s Sean Boswell) has been rumored to return in 8 and beyond ; maybe he can step up and start to fill the huge hole left by Paul Walker.\nEither way, I encourage action movie buffs and diehard Fast fanatics alike to see this one, preferably on opening weekend when the theater is thick with hype. (There\u2019s no other franchise where clapping and screaming throughout the movie is as utterly appropriate.) I need people to talk about it with, after all.\nVox Video: Every Fast and Furious movie plot in 10 minutes\n","Title":"Furious 7 review: bigger, crazier, and kind of a mess | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","transportation","film"]}
