We sat down with the studio's founder to discuss how it's moving from creating games to letting others create whatever they want.\nLongreads\nJack El-Hai tells the strange and fascinating story of America\u2019s first suicide bomber in 1891.\nThe Arcade Building was a somber brownstone rising six floors over Broadway, and it was where Sage had worked for years. On December 4, a man walked into Sage\u2019s offices. The press would later describe the man as 'an insane crank,' 'a dangerous maniac,' and 'a man of unbalanced mind.' A clerk greeted the visitor, who was grasping a bulky handbag and said he was a representative of John D. Rockefeller, the immensely rich magnate of Standard Oil. He had urgent business to discuss in-person with Sage. When told about the visitor, the 75-year-old Sage examined him through a window in an office partition. 'I saw a young man sitting on the bench,' Sage later said. 'He had a dark beard somewhat pointed.' Sage did not recognize him, 'but I felt instinctively a distrust of the man.'\nTorture: No one said no\nNew York Review of Books\nDavid Cole explores the details in leaked CIA records that reveal the United States government\u2019s tacit approval of torturing detainees.\nEven though the program had been approved at its outset by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice in July 2002 and by Attorney General John Ashcroft in August 2002, the slightest hint that the Bush administration might actually be committed to avoiding torture or inhumane treatment caused the CIA to panic. Bush administration lawyers had determined that the methods the agency was using to induce detainees to talk\u2014including waterboarding, extended sleep deprivation, slamming into walls, and painful stress positions\u2014were not torture and did not violate the prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. But the agency acted as if it couldn\u2019t quite believe it.\nA Death\nThe New Yorker\nIgnore the real world for a little bit this weekend, with a new, noir short story from Stephen King.\nThe two men on the seat of the buckboard got down and stood either side of it. One drew his gun; the other did not. Trusdale knew their faces but not their names. They were town men. The sheriff and the other four went into his shack. One of them was Hines, the undertaker. They were in there for some time. They even opened the stove and dug through the ashes. At last they came out.\nNick Kroll's walk in the park\nBuzzFeed\nAnne Helen Petersen takes a hike in Los Angeles with comedian Nick Kroll, and along the way, attempts to tease out a picture of the man behind the jokes.\n\u2018There\u2019s very few public places in L.A. where people are just existing together,\u2019 he says as we decide on a path back down \u2014 something, he adds, that he misses about New York. A young woman approaches, and for a second, I think she\u2019s going to ask for a selfie with Kroll, but she\u2019s just flustered and lost: The trails of Griffith Park are complicated, and she has no idea how to make her way down. Kroll walks her through three different scenarios, and after several minutes, they settle on a route that\u2019ll return her home.

Although, to be fair, we are talking about a select group. We are assuming they have [internet] access and can afford a data plan. Still, I am fascinated about this idea of what does it mean when you realize that you can look on Vine or YouTube and you are like, \u2018Every kid in America has a bedroom that looks just like mine.\u2019 Photo by Wesley Verhoeve .\nListen to this\nOf Montreal - Aureate Gloom\nKevin Barnes drops yet another album into his hefty canon.

Some of the same locations and faces are in there, but they\u2019ve all been tweaked and revamped so the entire experience is refreshed and captivating.\nWatch this\nGrey Gardens\nThe award-winning documentarian Albert Maysles passed away this week . Really, you could watch any of his films, from the Rolling Stones unsettling tour docÂ Gimme Shelter to 2014\u2019s Iris, about the interior decorator Iris Apfel.
