{"Main text":"BlackBerry inexplicably redesigns the Passport for AT&T\nBBM is coming to Android Wear, too\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBlackBerry ran a small press conference here at CES 2015 to announce that it's releasing the BlackBerry Passport and BlackBerry Classic on AT&T. Oddly, AT&T apparently requested that the Passport get rounded corners, and BlackBerry did that. CrackBerry reports that CEO John Chen explained the reasoning for the change thusly:Â \"AT&T wanted rounded corners. Some of us are more square. No other reason than that.\" Okay.\nThe Passport will be available \"in the near future\" for $649.99 off-contract, or as little as zero down on a Next plan. The Classic is quite a bit cheaper, at $419.99 off-contact.\nAlong with the AT&T news, BlackBerry also demoed an update to its BBM app for Android. It supports Android Wear now, letting you read messages, accept invites, send pre-defined responses, and dictate messages. BlackBerry says it will be available \"soon.\"\nVerge Video Archives: Blackberry Passport Review\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
