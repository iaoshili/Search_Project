{"Main text":"Everyone stares at their smartphone in the first trailer for 'Juno' director's next film\nThere's more clicking than talking in 'Men, Women & Children'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere isn't a single line of dialog inÂ  the first trailer for Men, Women & Children, the next film from Juno director Jason Reitman. And yet, because the film displays little popups depicting the digital communications that are simultaneously pushing everyone apart and bringing them together, we still know a ton about the people it shows and the world they inhabit. The film isn't meant to take place in a dystopia, but the entire world is so absorbed by the screens in front of them that no one is really communicating with anyone else. It's deeply unsettling, but it looks like Reitman's next picture will be taking as sharp of a look at our current culture as his other films have.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
