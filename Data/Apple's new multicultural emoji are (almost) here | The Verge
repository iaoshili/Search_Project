{"Main text":"Apple's new multicultural emoji are (almost) here\nPlus, there's an Apple Watch emoji\nEarlier this month, Apple began seeding OS X 10.10.3 to developers and rolling out an iOS 8.3 beta with the promise of  updated, multicultural emoji . But we didn't know what those new emoji would look like \u2014 until now.\nIt's been almost a year since Apple began pursuing diverse emoji\nToday, Apple launched its second OS X 10.10.3 and iOS 8.3 beta updates, which feature a redesigned emoji keyboard and emoji skin tone modifiers,  9To5Mac reports . Any human icon can get a new skin tone if the user taps and holds the character.  MacRumors notes the family emoji category now includes same-sex couples and couples without children. The available skin tones are based on five tones in the Fitzpatrick scale, a dermatology standard adopted by the Unicode Consortium.\nIt's not just the human emoji who have gotten a revamp \u2014 there are more than 300 new characters available. As  The Next Web points out , the watch emoji is now (what else?) an Apple Watch.\nIt's been almost a year since Apple first  announced its plans to diversify its emoji , and they're still only available to testers. The update is expected to become available to all users this spring.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
