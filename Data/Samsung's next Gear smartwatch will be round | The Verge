{"Main text":"Samsung's next Gear smartwatch will be round\nThere's never been a better time to release a smartwatch\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt looks like Samsung's next Gear smartwatch will eschew its familiar square design for a fully rounded watch face. Unearthed by  Android Central , a Samsung press release announcing the release of the SDK for the next Gear smartwatch shows a round watch face alongside apps from CNN, Yelp, and Baidu. Given the rapidly increasing number of round Android Wear smartwatches like the  LG G Watch R and the  Huawei Watch , it's no surprise that Samsung decided to give the traditional watch style a try. To get ready for the change, Samsung is releasing the SDK before an announcement is even made, in hopes of having the majority of the Tizen-based Gear apps ready for the switch. The spotlight has never been brighter on smartwatches than it is right now, so it shouldn't be too long before we get an official announcement from Samsung.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
