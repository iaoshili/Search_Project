{"Main text":"Gmail now lets you edit Microsoft Office documents from your inbox\nImport attached files to Google's Docs formats\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle has  today added a new feature to Gmail inboxes that allows users to edit Microsoft Office documents sent as email attachments. Click the new \"edit\" option on an Office file attachment and Gmail will convert the file to the relevant Google format, saving it in Google Drive to allow for continuous editing and sharing. Google has also increased the amount of Office file types it can import to Docs to make this process easier \u2014 the list now includes 15 less-used Office formats including presentation show files .pps and .ppsx.\nIf you need to edit the Office attachments without changing the file type, but don't have the Microsoft suite on your desktop, Google suggests you use its  Office Editing Chrome extension . The extension, last updated at the end of November, allows users to alter Office files and save them in their original format from their Chrome browser.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
