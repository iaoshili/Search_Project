{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHellboy creator Mike Mignola is stepping deeper into the world of Gothic horror with his new miniseries, Frankenstein Underground. Fans of Mignola\u2019s particular breed of monster should be excited; as an writer and artist, Mignola has been penning stories about demons and paranormal entities at Dark Horse Comics for more than 20 years. Hellboy, which follows the misadventures of a gun-toting half-demon in the mid-20th century, got its start in 1994 before spawning two cult classic movies directed by modern-day master of horror Guillermo del Toro.\nFrankenstein\u2019s monster \u2014 the same Mary Shelley unleashed onto the world in 1818 \u2014 is now going to have to find his way in the Mignolaverse. After last being seen facing off against Hellboy in a Mexican luchador match, the creature is now lost and alone on a journey that takes him literally underground, as he faces the kind of ancient races you might see in Burrough\u2019s At the Earth\u2019s Core or Lovecraft\u2019s At the Mountains of Madness. I sat down with Mignola to talk about the book, which just hit stores today, and the monster\u2019s place in pop culture.\nThis is Frankenstein At the Earth's Core\nStarting just generally, what is Frankenstein Underground about?\nIt\u2019s kinda started out as, What if I took the Frankenstein monster and threw him into a Edgar Rice Burroughs sort of underground series. Just banging around monsters and subhuman underground people. And once I started digging around in the plot, and started bringing in more of the elements from the Hellboy universe, then the book took on a really different shape.\nYou introduced the monster in Hellboy: House of the Living Dead. This is going to be an extension of that?\nIt departs from Hellboy entirely. I mean, Hellboy appears in one panel in a flashback, but House of the Living Dead took place in Mexico, so it\u2019s just picking up [with] that monster in Mexico, probably just a few weeks after that graphic novel took place. And then the book is entirely about Frankenstein, and things happen that drop him into this underground world. It touches on and develops certain ideas that are in Hellboy and the BPRD [Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense] books as far as this history of these prehistoric civilizations, and a lot of the stuff I had going on with the various Victorian characters. It fleshes out some of the history of the Hellboy world, but stands entirely on its own.\n\"It fleshes out the 'Hellboy' world, but stands entirely on its own.\"\nHow are you balancing Mary Shelley\u2019s original work with your own style?\nWell, that was a trick. I didn\u2019t realize it was actually the Frankenstein monster [at first], so there was no attempt at all to make him like the Mary Shelley character. In fact, the Frankenstein monster that\u2019s in my head is always the Boris Karloff Frankenstein. So the biggest trick with this book was to take this kind of dumb brute monster I\u2019d started with in House of the Living Dead and kind of rationalize how the Mary Shelley character could have become this character. And then really just finding my own voice for the character, which is not as eloquent as Mary Shelley, but a little bit more conversational than the Karloff Frankenstein. I definitely had to find my own version of this character, even though I reference the Shelley novel and I think I\u2019m faithful to the Shelley novel. There are a couple of scenes that are flashbacks to the Shelley novel, so it\u2019s rooted in the Shelley novel. But the whole point of this book is not really to chew over who the monster is or where he\u2019s come from. It\u2019s to throw him into this particular story, and who he is kind of colors his reactions to things, but his origins [aren\u2019t] the focus of the book.\nSo he\u2019s striking a balance between the more brutish Karloff version and the poetic Shelley version.\nYeah, he\u2019s definitely more thoughtful than the monster was in the first Karloff film, but Karloff, in Bride of Frankenstein, is a little bit more thoughtful. He\u2019s definitely sadder. He speaks. And that\u2019s the Karloff Frankenstein that\u2019s always in my head. My version of Frankenstein is extremely sad. He feels terrible about a lot of stuff he\u2019s done. He\u2019s got some justifiable anger from the way he\u2019s been treated, which is, I think, all very neatly in Bride of Frankenstein. It wasn\u2019t that big a stretch to say the Shelley character, which is from 1816\u2026 if the monster has been around for that long, and been abused and beaten and hunted and blah blah blah, after all these years, by 1956, he\u2019s kind of run down and brutish and doesn\u2019t talk very much. As I script this series, I find as he gets further into this book, he does speak a little bit more. He does articulate more. But for the most part, at least in the early part of the book, he\u2019s not a dumb brute, but he\u2019s not used to having a conversation.\nThe monster has been abused and beaten for more than a century\nFor you as a writer, why Frankenstein in particular? You obviously have a very deep love for the Universal Monsters.\nWriting House of the Living Dead, that book was just a parade of different monsters. It\u2019s got the Frankenstein Monster, it\u2019s got a vampire, it\u2019s got some female vampires, it\u2019s got a hunchback, it\u2019s got a Wolfman. It was such a nod to those old Universal movies, like House of Dracula and House of Frankenstein. I needed to have a Frankenstein-type creature in there. The reanimated corpse with the bolts. It\u2019s such an iconic horror image. I needed him in there. But, not until I wrote the back cover copy for the book did I name it the Frankenstein monster. I never would have intentionally said, \"Oh now I\u2019m gonna use the Frankenstein monster.\" It\u2019s just I had this monster who could be Frankenstein, and when it came to writing the back cover copy, the funniest phrase was \"...and the Frankenstein Monster!\" So, that\u2019s how I ended up having my own version. But once you have him, you kind of file him away and go, \"Yeah, that\u2019s one of the dozen different things that we could expand on someday.\" It\u2019s always good to have six or seven of these different projects that you could do. The original idea was actually to do a series of books about him exploring around underground, and then once I brought this other stuff into it, it really did turn into just one book. There\u2019s no plan to do a second volume. I don\u2019t want to put a number on the spine. It doesn\u2019t mean we couldn\u2019t do another one, but it felt like a one book story.\nDo you think it\u2019s timely to come out with something like this now, with I, Frankenstein and Dracula Untold both coming out last year?\nI mean, I would think anytime\u2019s a good time for the Frankenstein monster. It\u2019s always something in the works. That didn\u2019t influence me, as far as the timing of the book. If it\u2019s good timing, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve never looked at what current trends are for why I do stuff. For me, the Frankenstein monster is so timeless, and there\u2019s never a time when people don\u2019t know who that character is. If it helps, that\u2019s great. I will say I have I had not seen the TV series Penny Dreadful before I started the book. And when I watched that show, I realized I probably would not have done this Frankenstein book, because that was such a beautiful handling of the Mary Shelley-type Frankenstein monster that I was would have been intimidated to go anywhere near this character. Fortunately, the series was already half done when I watched Penny Dreadful, so it was too late to put on the brakes.\nFrankenstein Underground is now available.\n","Title":"Hellboy creator Mike Mignola is reinventing Frankenstein | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment"]}
