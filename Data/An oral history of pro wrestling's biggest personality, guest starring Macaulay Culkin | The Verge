Written by Max Landis, the supervillain origin story was a smart play on the found footage format. I've been waiting to see what Landis does next. According to IMDB , weÂ should see something later this year.\nIn the meantime, we have the Max Landis' YouTube channel, which I learned about today through the writer's hilarious oral history of pro-wrestling icon, Triple H. Many celebrities make guest appearances, including Macaulay Culkin, D.C. Pierson, and Haley Joel Osment.

You can watch that video above; below, I've included Landis' tribute to another pro-wrestler, one John Cena.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
