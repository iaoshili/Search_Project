For eight years now, designer Nicholas Felton has been tackling that question with his annual report, compiled from exhaustive logs of every email, text, and conversation he participated in all year. This year's version is particularly dense, laying out the messages geographically, by vocabulary, and plotting pleasantries vs. content in the final page. In the final accounting, texts made up just over 40 percent of Felton's communications, although two-thirds of the people he talked to were reached over email. The most common profanity was \"hell\" (245 instances), and the most mentioned drugs were Advil (38) and caffeine (26). The most mentioned writer, of course, was Edward Tufte.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nTracking Felton's communications by time. March was a particularly heavy email month.\nBreaking out the data by medium, we see how heavily email an SMS dominate Felton's life. Most of his conversations and calls were with his girlfriend, Olga Bell.\nEmail and mail are dominated by automated services like Big Cartel (a branded clothing website) and Felton's New Yorker subscription.\nPlotting different people by channel affiliation, we see the crucial role email plays in Felton's life. Many of the people he communicates with are primarily reached by email. By contrast, the sparse grouping around \"telephone\" indicates that there is almost no one who only communicates through phone calls.\nOne interesting note from the reciprocity chart: Felton received far more messages from his girlfriend than he sent to her.\nIn total, Felton recorded 7.7 million words, the vast majority of which came from emails. Conversation and texting combined contributed less than a tenth of email's word count.\nRelative interrogative use reveals that Felton said the word \"how\" significantly more often in conversation than in any other medium. \"What,\" by contrast, was most often said via SMS.\nAs you might expect, Felton most often had conversations at his home, his workplace, or his studio.\nHe discussed a wide variety of locations, but they are still primarily grouped in Europe and the two American coasts.\nDividing conversations by topic is a fuzzier metric, but Felton identified 48,170 unique topics in his message cache \u2014 primarily people and places.\nFelton also identified 25,000 distinct people, roughly four percent of whom were musicians.\nRoughly one in four conversations involved a formal pleasantry (most typically \"thank you\"). Female cashiers were particularly likely to receive a pleasantry.\n","Title":"Data porn: what does a year's worth of conversation look like? | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
