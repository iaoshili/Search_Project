{"Main text":"Can 'Mixed Reality Living Spaces' fix our overcrowded future?\nAugmented reality turns a single room into many\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith the world population expected to rise from 7.2 billion to  9.6 billion by 2050 , living space is becoming more and more of an issue. A student at Parsons has a vision of our future homes that is both clever and disquieting. Bernando Schorr's \"Mixed Reality Living Spaces\" project highlights how augmented reality can be used to make windowless 100-square-foot apartments hospitable. The video on his website shows projections on the walls changing to accommodate the different configurations of the environment's only furniture, a trio of modular white boxes. The results are depressingly spartan but functional. Schorr's video demonstrates how a single room can be turned into a dining area, an office, a bedroom, and even a home entertainment space. It's not impossible to imagine the idea eventually evolving into something like the room from this clip of the sci-fi movie Cloud Atlas.\nOver the years, many have worked to solve the problems of urban overcrowding. The MIT Media Lab, for example, recently unveiled the latest iteration of CityHome, a vision for  a high-tech modular studio apartment . In 2010,  Reuters reported on how architect Gary Chang made his 344-square-foot home into a veritable mansion.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
