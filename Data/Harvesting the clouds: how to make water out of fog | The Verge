In the case of collecting water from air, that meant desert plants and animals \u2014 seeing what special structures they might have to harvest fog water. So it was surprising when a fog-collecting discovery came from a far wetter source: the beaks of shorebirds. And it could inspire a pretty radical redesign of fog collection devices.\nThe new beak-inspired fog collector consists of two plates that come together and then move apart, collecting and transporting deposited water droplets.

The Standard Fog Collector, used all over the world since Robert Schemenauer's first paper on it in 1994 , consists of a fabric mesh 1 square meter in size and faces the wind like little perforated sail. As the wind blows fog through the device, water droplets accumulate on the mesh and drop down into a trough, from which they flow down a tube into a container.\n\"Fog has a really big impact on the world\"\nDaniel Fernandez, a fog researcher at California State University, Monterey Bay, has set up 20 standard fog collectors along the California coast. While most such fog collectors gather just a few liters a day, where they\u2019re placed can make all the difference; Fernandez says he has collected almost 40 liters, or about 10 gallons, per square meter in a day from some parts of Big Sur.\n\"Fog has a really big impact on the world we live in, particularly in the coastal areas in California,\" Fernandez says. On a summer day along the winding Northern California coast, the cool waters of the Pacific can cause the moisture in the air above to condense, forming low-lying clouds. As the breeze brings these clouds onto the shore and close to the ground, they form fog. It\u2019s the same kind of fog that spreads into San Francisco, giving the city its iconic fog cover \u2014 and keeps temperatures along the California coast cool.\n\"what's nice about fog is it tends to happen when we don't have rain.\"\nFog is made of tiny suspended water droplets. When these droplets hit California\u2019s coastal redwoods, they are intercepted by the trees\u2019 leaves and drip down to make the surrounding areas wet. That\u2019s crucial in the coastal ecosystem, since fog can contribute water when other sources such as rain are scarce. \"What\u2019s nice about fog is it tends to happen when we don\u2019t have rain, typically,\" Fernandez says. Even now, during one of California\u2019s most severe droughts, there\u2019s been plenty of coastal fog to go around. For instance, 2013 was California\u2019s driest calendar year since the state started measuring rainfall in 1849, with just 7 inches of aggregated rain, and the period from October 2013 to September 2014 has been the third-driest on record. But the fog rolled in as usual this summer, and contributed its water both to the redwoods and to Fernandez\u2019s fog collectors.\nFog collectors are even more useful in areas with more extreme conditions than California, particularly in parts of South America such as Chile. High up in the Andes, in desert areas that receive almost no rainfall, dense fog can serve as a significant source of water. \"You get more water from fog in many parts of Chile than you get from rain,\" Fernandez says.\nFog collection is a relatively cheap and environmentally friendly source of water in many remote arid regions. The collected water is often of good quality, so it can provide drinking water where it\u2019s otherwise unavailable. Fog collecting projects have been implemented all over the world, in countries such as Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Namibia, Eritrea, Oman, and Nepal, many of these implemented by a Canadian non-profit called FogQuest .\nfog collection can serve as a relatively cheap source of water in many arid regions\nRight now, fog collection is still useful in a limited range of places \u2014 ones with large amounts of fog and few other sources of water \u2014 but that may not always be the case. Several research groups are working on devising better fog collectors made of new materials and designs, which could collect water more efficiently and expand the regions where fog collection could be useful. As we try to reduce our water consumption and look for more sources of fresh water, we may need to rely on more such innovative approaches.\nDaniel Fernandez stands in front of three Standard Fog Collectors with different types of meshes.

Many shorebirds dip their beaks into the water while swimming , capturing their tiny prey in water droplets held between their beaks. They then open and close their beaks repeatedly to transport the prey-containing droplets into their mouths.\nHeng saw stills from high-speed videos showing the birds' open-and-close technique, and wondered if he could harness it to catch water from air, rather than prey from water. He used two hinged plates that come together and then move apart to  mimic the movement of the shorebirds\u2019 beaks. Droplets of fog that  collect on the plates are transported en masse to the hinge each time the plates clamp down and then separate. At the moment, Heng moves the  plates by hand, but he expects to motorize future models.\nHeng saw stills from high-speed videos showing the birds' technique and wondered if he could harness it.\nMesh-based fog collectors rely on gravity to passively drive water droplets down into a trough. \"In our case, we actively transport the water droplets,\" Heng says. He expects active transport to be much better at transporting small droplets that otherwise would remain on the mesh. \"Because we use an active transport process, we expect that all the drops can be transported,\" he says.\nFog on Tanbark trail in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park ( Christian Holland ).\nHeng and his fellow researchers \"are developing an interesting technique,\" says Otto Klemm, a professor of climatology at the University of Münster who has been interested in fog for the past 30 years. Klemm says even a small increase in the amount of fog water collected \"would be helpful, definitely.\"\nHeng has tested both a tiny fog collector that\u2019s a little smaller than a matchbook, and a larger model that\u2019s a little smaller than a license plate, and published his results in September 2014 . The larger model collected about a tablespoon\u2019s worth, or about 15 mL of water, in 36 minutes in lab tests. That makes it several hundred times more efficient at collecting water than individual desert beetles, grasses, or metal wires, Heng says. The larger version can collect both fog and dew over short periods of time and on a small scale \u2014 so it could also be developed into a portable model. Heng is currently testing a much larger version made of plastic acrylic plates 70 square centimeters in size. He hopes to have an even larger collector ready in a year. \"I need to do more experiments to try to optimize our setup, but after that we can try to commercialize our device,\" Heng says.\nthe unorthodox design could prompt researchers to look more broadly for inspiration\nOnce he\u2019s finished lab tests of his largest device he plans to take his fog collectors out to a nearby lake or river to try them out in the morning fog and dew. He also plans to compare the device to existing mesh-based fog collectors, and to his original cactus-based designs.\nWhile it\u2019s still too early to know how the new plate-based fog collector will fare, it could prompt researchers to look more broadly for inspiration. Heng's device bears a resemblance to dew collectors, which often consist of a plastic or metal sheet on which water condenses \u2014 and as a consequence, Heng expects his design will also harvest dew. He also plans to incorporate additional tweaks, such as including microstructures on the plates to try to enhance their efficiency.\nIt\u2019s not until the new design has been used in the field that it can be properly evaluated, Klemm says. \"That\u2019s a very, very large step, maybe larger than the engineering itself,\" he says. \"Out there it\u2019s a different world, and many things don\u2019t behave as nicely in the field as they do in the laboratory,\" Klemm says.\nFog in Chile's Atacama desert ( Danielle Periera )\nIt's different outside the lab\nOne of the advantages of the mesh-based fog collectors is that they\u2019ve been extensively tested in the real world. The Chilean-made mesh material is hardy and inexpensive, and has been used in successful projects all over the world. \"Existing meshes are well-tested and work well,\" says Klemm. \"We\u2019re still looking for other materials, but the Chilean version is a very good one, and it\u2019s cheap.\"\nOne of the test fog collectors set up by the MIT team in Chile, as it gathers water in the white plastic drum.

In addition, while high-tech designs could be more efficient, they could also result in fog collectors that are more expensive and harder to maintain in remote arid regions, Klemm says. \"The more engineering there is, the less is the chance that these will be applicable for poor people in semi-desert regions,\" he says.\nTo harvest large amounts of water, researchers use a bigger version of the Standard Fog Collector called a Large Fog Collector, with a mesh that\u2019s about 40\u201350 square meters in size. Both versions of the fog collector use a double-layered polypropylene mesh manufactured in Chile, with a pattern of vertically stretched triangles.\nResearchers have been trying to optimize the mesh-based fog collectors, and Cal State\u2019s Fernandez says he\u2019s currently testing three different types of meshes. \"We\u2019re comparing the standard one made in Chile, we\u2019re comparing one made in Germany, which is supposedly a bit more effective, and we\u2019re comparing one that\u2019s made by researchers made at MIT, which is supposedly optimal,\" he says. Fernandez says he\u2019s collecting data from all three types of meshes, and should have the results sometime in 2015.\nThe MIT mesh was developed by mechanical engineering professor Gareth McKinley and chemical engineering professor Robert Cohen. The new mesh is much finer, made of stainless steel filaments 3-4 times the thickness of a human hair, and has smaller holes and a special coating that allows water to flow down more easily. Laboratory experiments showed that these changes could make it five times as efficient as traditional meshes, and the group published their results in July 2013 .\nThe MIT group notes that the increased efficiency of fog collectors made of their optimized mesh could expand the geographic range where collectors would be useful. Fog collection is currently most useful only in certain areas \u2014 but in those areas, it can be invaluable.\nLocation, location, location\nFog collectors could make a significant difference to the water supply of many arid regions. A United Nations report notes that \"fog collection technology appears to be an extremely promising and low-cost water harvesting system for drinking water, crop irrigation, livestock beverage, and forest restoration in dryland mountains.\"\n\"Fog collection makes sense in very specific regions of the world,\" Klemm says. \"These are areas where there\u2019s a lot of fog but no rain, and a lot of wind, and they can collect huge amounts of fog water there,\" he says. It\u2019s not just the abundance of fog that makes these areas suitable for fog collectors, but also their sparse populations and lack of other freshwater sources, he says.\nKlemm cites Guatemala as a successful example. In the high mountain regions, some villages don\u2019t have fresh water close at hand. Villagers must go down to the valley to get water and then carry it back up the mountain. With fog collection, though, each villager gets the few liters of water they need daily without the strenuous hike.\nTop: Fog curls into San Francisco ( NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen and Robert Simmo ). Bottom: Dense Tule fog blankets central California ( NASA Earth Observatory image by Jeff Schmaltz ).\n\"I think in some areas one can really develop nice networks of fog collectors, that really supply several hundreds or thousands of people,\" Klemm says. \"But you need the right environment for it.\"\nGiven the current extreme drought in California, and how much fog the state gets both at the coast and as Tule fog in the central valley , it\u2019s tempting to think that fog water could help alleviate California\u2019s water deficit. The problem is that unlike the inhabitants of remote desert regions in Chile or Eritrea, an average US citizen uses about 100 gallons of water a day. That\u2019s without taking into account how many people live in California, or the even vaster amounts of water needed for the state's agriculture. Fog collection would struggle to meet the water needs there, especially since California could get water more efficiently and cost-effectively from its snowpack and rivers and dams, Münster\u2019s Klemm says.\n\"If somebody was surviving on a few gallons a day, that might make sense, but given the vast amounts of water we consume and waste, I would question the value of trying to hook up fog into a municipal water system,\" says Fernandez. We\u2019re better off first learning to use less water and to minimize wastage, he says. \"Just the amount of water wasted would far exceed the amount that one could physically bring in by setting up fog collectors.\"\nThere are situations where the collectors could be useful, though. There are areas in Spain and in the Canary Islands where fog water is collected to help fight forest fires, Klemm says, and one could envision similar initiatives in California. Fog collectors could be placed in remote areas to  collect drinking water for wild animals, to collect extra water during a  dry summer, or to supplement rainwater capture in a building that  already has a cistern, Fernandez says.\nIt\u2019s premature to think that any new technology, whether for fog collection or for something else, could solve all our water problems, Fernandez says. But fog collection could help in small ways, and a number of different methods like this could all play a part. \"That\u2019s where I think the excitement is, in the innovations that people can come up with to apply things like this,\" he says. \"Fog is such an amazing phenomenon, beautiful and mysterious.\"\n","Title":"Harvesting the clouds: how to make water out of fog | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
