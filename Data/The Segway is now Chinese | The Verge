{"Main text":"The Segway is now Chinese\nBeijing-based Ninebot acquires maker of the much-maligned upright scooter\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSegway, maker of the famous (and oft-ridiculed) two-wheeled vehicles, has been acquired by a Chinese robotics company,  The Wall Street Journal reports. Beijing-based Ninebot said in a news conference today that it purchased its US rival for an undisclosed sum, adding that it received an $80 million investment from Xiaomi and Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm.\nNinebot was accused of infringing Segway's patents\nThe Segway was first unveiled in 2001, with inventor Dean Kamen predicting that his two-wheeled, upright electric scooter would revolutionize transportation. Instead, it became more of a punchline, though the Segway has inspired  imitators \u2014 including Ninebot, which also makes two-wheeled \" personal transportation robots .\" Last year, Segway  accused Ninebot and several other Chinese companies of infringing on its patents, as part of what the company described as a \"widespread pattern of infringement\" across China.\nSegway's ownership has changed hands over the years, as the company struggled to make profits. In 2009, it was sold to a group led by British millionaire Jimi Heselden, who  died after riding a Segway off a cliff in 2010.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
