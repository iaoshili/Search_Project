{"Main text":"Watch the video for Kanye West and Paul McCartney's single 'Only One'\nSpike Jonze directs\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe  surprising and  incredible collaboration between Kanye West and Paul McCartney has added another member: filmmaker Spike Jonze. West just  released a music video , directed by Jonze, for the song \"Only One,\" which he and McCartney  released at the beginning of the month . Basically, the video is crazy adorable because it's just West playing with his daughter, North, who definitely has no idea what's going on. There's nothing fancy about the video, but that's also why it works: like the song, it's a sincere look at the connection between parent and child. The video can't be embedded, but you can  watch it over at West's site .\nONLY ONE directed by Spike Jonze http:\/\/t.co\/1xvft3AjCn\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
