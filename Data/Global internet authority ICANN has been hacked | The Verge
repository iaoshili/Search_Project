{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nICANN \u2014 the organization responsible for allocating IP addresses and domain names for the internet \u2014 has been hacked. The US-administered non-profit has said that its  internal systems were breached following a spear phishing attack in late November. Employees were tricked into giving up their credentials after receiving emails apparently sent from the organization\u2019s own domain.\nHackers accessed names, passwords, emails and addresses\nICANN says the hackers accessed internal emails, a members-only Wiki page containing public information, the WHOIS portal (used to look up who registered a particular domain), and the organization\u2019s Centralized Zone Data System (CZDS). This last breach is the most troubling as ICANN reports that the attackers gained access to a wide range of user information including real names, addresses, emails, telephones and usernames. Users\u2019 passwords were also accessed but ICANN has said that these were encrypted rather than stored as plaintext.\nAlthough it\u2019s a given that an organization like ICANN is going to be a tempting target for hackers the breach could be used as evidence that the US needs to retain greater control over the organization. President Obama  announced plans in March to give up many of the government's powers over the day-to-day function of the internet, only to be met by  conservative opposition accusing him of giving too much power to America's rivals. Thankfully this hack seems too slight to count against the president's plans.\n","Title":"Global internet authority ICANN has been hacked | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
