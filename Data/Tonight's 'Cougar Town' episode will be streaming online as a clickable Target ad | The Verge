Through a deal with Target, TBS' unfortunately named sitcom will be simultaneously broadcast on TV and  streamed online , where viewers will be able to mouse over select products to learn more about them. Doing so will pause the show and \u2014 naturally \u2014 display an easy way for viewers to buy what they're looking at.\nAn entire plot line will revolve around a Target shopping spree\nAccording to The New York Times , over two dozen products will be featured as part of a plot line that has two characters redecorating an apartment after a Target shopping spree. Whenever Target's items are shown on screen, a flashing red plus sign will appear beside them, signaling that they can be selected. The product integration is already being  featured online in a behind-the-scenes video, which shows how Target's products \u2014 including a rug, a lamp, and some wall art \u2014 will look on set. The Times reports that the full episode will be  streaming with the integration from tonight through April 15th. It appears that the oversized bottles of wine that Cougar Town's characters are usually drinking from will not be included in the promotion.\nMore than a few apps and services have attempted to make shopping like this a reality, letting TV viewers immediately identify what actors are wearing or determine where they can buy the products that they're seeing. That's obviously an ambitious and difficult task without working closely with studios, which Target is doing here for this one-off promotion. If its successful though, it's likely to only increase companies' resolve that this could be a key way to shop down the road \u2014 but for now, the integration is just distracting.\n","Title":"Tonight's 'Cougar Town' episode will be streaming online as a clickable Target ad | The Verge","Tags":["business","entertainment"]}
