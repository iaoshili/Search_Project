Activision has announced Guitar Hero Live will be coming this fall to consoles and mobile (the $99 box will get you the guitar controller and a platform-specific game). It\u2019s the first Guitar Hero title in over five years and will once again compete with Harmonix\u2019s Rock Band, which is also coming out of retirement this year .\nBut this isn\u2019t the same Guitar Hero as before. Developer FreeStyleGames, whose past work includes the unique DJ Hero series, has rethought huge swaths of the familiar Guitar Hero formula (as well as creating its own 24-hour playable music video channels ). From what we\u2019ve seen and played so far, it\u2019s a legitimately exciting proposition.\nThe biggest change, in that it breaks with all past guitar titles, is a new button layout for the guitar controller. The classic five rainbow-colored buttons are gone in lieu of a three-by-two vertical grid. It\u2019s a small step toward actual guitar positioning (i.e. two strings and three frets). Accordingly, each fret now shares one of three on-screen lanes differentiated by black picks pointing up or white picks pointing down.\nRead next: Guitar Hero TV is like a playable version of classic MTV\nPicture this: if the lane of notes has a black pick followed by two white picks, your pointer finger would be on the top first fret, your middle finger would be on the lower second fret, and your ring finger would be on the lower third fret. Chord shapes!\nIt may sound complicated, but the end result is a more streamlined experience that requires relearning how to \"read\" Guitar Hero\u2019s real-time sheet music. All of which is to say, like past Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles, the more challenging levels will be as much about reflexes as they are about pattern recognition and memorization.\nGot that? Okay, let\u2019s talk about the background.\nGuitar Hero Live\u2019s main campaign is designed to play out from the first-person point of view of a rocker on stage, with actual humans both in the audience and on stage with you.\nThink of it as two parallel dimensions that you keep hopping between in real time. If you\u2019re playing well, you get the \"good\" version with the audience going crazy and the band nodding favorably. Start playing poorly and the screen will briefly distort and switch to the \"bad\" version, where the band starts giving you incredulous looks and the audience gets increasingly irritated as the song goes on. (We also noticed some poster board signs change \u2014 a smiley face turned sour, for example.)\nFreeStyleGames shot each performance twice using a motion control camera rig that could replicate the exact same movements multiple times over so that you could jump from \"good\" to \"bad\" at any point and maintain the same first-person continuity and choreography. We had a chance to play through two different venues \u2014 each with its own pre-performance build-up, literally walking from the green room on stage and onto a stage in front of hundreds or thousands of fans. The effect is cool in action (assuming you pay attention the background at all while playing), but we\u2019ll have to see how many venues are included in the final build. We could see it getting pretty repetitive.\nAnd then there\u2019s Guitar Hero TV , an online experience that lets you play along with various \"channels\" of music playlists that run 24 hours a day. GHTV eschews the first-person background for official music videos. It\u2019s Guitar Hero Live\u2019s de facto online multiplayer \/ offline party experience, and it\u2019s so integral to the game that the guitar controller has a dedicated button for jumping in and out of the mode. \"Out of the box you can go play on the channels to your heart's content without paying any kind of subscription fee,\" FreeStyleGames\u2019s Creative Director Jamie Jackson told us. If you\u2019re wondering about potential premium channels \/ premium à la carte tracks, that\u2019s something the company isn\u2019t talking about yet.\nThe lineup so far\n","Title":"Guitar Hero Live is a first-person rock star simulator coming this fall | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","hands--on","entertainment"]}
