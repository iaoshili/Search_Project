{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe portrayal of \"hacking\" has been abysmal in movies and television ever since Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum took down an alien invasion with a PowerBook in Independence Day. There\u2019s something about the very notion itself that seems to foil most filmmakers , and even if they aren\u2019t using it as a superpower to backdoor their characters out of a jam, they stumble when it comes to visuals \u2014 turning keystrokes and problem solving into overwrought special effects sequences with the visual coherence of a Michael Bay movie.\nSo I suppose I was a little bit skeptical about the SXSW premiere of Mr. Robot, a new thriller series from USA about a cyber-security engineer named Elliot (Rami Malek) who spends his nights hacking into people\u2019s personal accounts to expose their hidden crimes. Christian Slater stars as the titular Mr. Robot, the Tyler Durden-esque leader of an underground group dedicated to taking down a monolithic mega-corp \u2014 and recruits Elliot to be part of his team.\nThe promotion at SXSW didn't help\nAlong with the program\u2019s name, I\u2019m sure some of my trepidation had to do with the promotion at SXSW this year. Elliot wears a black hoodie in the show, so of course USA had a legion of \"brand ambassadors\" roaming the halls, wearing sunglasses and Mr. Robot hoodies and just generally looking creepy. There was also some tie-in with the iBeacon network that SXSW is using this year that was supposed to send out push notifications, \"giving attendees a sense that Mr. Robot is watching their activity and helping them \u2018hack\u2019 SXSW.\"\nLike I said, the signs weren\u2019t good.\nHey guys, look!

Instead of the camera zooming through the innards of a laptop, there was Elliot, typing in a terminal window. Instead of using magical computer-god powers to find somebody\u2019s phone number, he walked up to them and got it with some good old-fashioned social engineering. And when Elliot eventually did try to use a program to break into an account, he collected personal information about the subject to speed up the brute force attack \u2014 and then it didn\u2019t even work.\nA lot of that attention to detail comes courtesy of creator and executive producer Sam Esmail, who, it turns out, has similar feelings about the way computers have been portrayed in the past. \"I\u2019m sorry, but every movie and show about hacking is so fucking terrible!\" he said in the post-screening Q&A. \"And they feel like they have to do all these CGI graphics, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Hacking doesn\u2019t look anything remotely like that.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, Chris Hemsworth does not look like a hacker.\"\n\"I'm sorry, Chris Hemsworth does not look like a hacker.\"\nWhile attempting to take the technology seriously is a big part of what makes Mr. Robot work, there\u2019s something more important in play: the awareness that no amount of visual effects or spectacle will make hacking exciting if the characters are boring and the stories bland. Elliot is an unnerving loner, but not of the stuck-in-mom\u2019s-basement variety we\u2019re used to seeing. He\u2019s got a drug problem, potentially a dissociative disorder, and while he\u2019s going to therapy, he can\u2019t help but spend his time analyzing his therapist instead. The way Malek plays him, Elliot is a manipulator of social mechanics first and foremost, and while he can\u2019t sustain a conversation with somebody he cares about, he can play a total stranger to gain access to their thoughts, their feelings, or their personal information.\nThere\u2019s also a blessed lack of over-explanation. When a company is hit with a DDOS attack, there\u2019s no vanilla breakdown of what that is, and when a rootkit is discovered in a system later in the show, things don\u2019t immediately grind to a halt so a supporting character can explain the concept. Esmail expects the viewer to keep up on their own, and the show makes it clear early on that it won\u2019t do a lot to help you out if you can\u2019t.\nA show where checking out a server farm is exciting\nNow, Mr. Robot does have more than its fair share of jargon soup. Elliot drops \"AFK\" and \"IRL\" as part of everyday conversation far too often, and he has a fish named \"Qwerty\" to prove how\u2026 keyboard-centric he is, I guess? But that\u2019s outweighed by the show\u2019s ability to create situations and scenarios around using computers that seem both realistic and genuinely dramatic. This isn\u2019t just a show where somebody flies out to a server farm to deal with a problem, this is a show where checking out a server farm is exciting.\nMr. Robot comes out this summer, and I\u2019m already looking forward to where the show will go from here, but the SXSW shenanigans could foreshadow a problem yet to come. Esmail has managed to create a show that doesn\u2019t make hacking ridiculous, but he\u2019ll need to find an audience to make it successful. Marketing campaigns that focus on goofy computer hijinks and spooky \"hackers\" are likely to turn off the very viewers the show should be scooping up. That would be a shame, because the show is better than its cheesy marketing and title would have you believe.\nVerge Video: Activating #brands at SXSW\n","Title":"Mr. Robot: finally, a hacking show that won't make you facepalm | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv","sxsw-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7979488"]}
