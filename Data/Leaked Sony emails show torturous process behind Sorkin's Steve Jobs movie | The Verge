{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEmails leaked in the massive hack of Sony Pictures have revealed fractious debates behind the production of Aaron Sorkin's Steve Jobs movie. Much of the drama,  collated by Gawker, is between producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal (both pictured above), who clash heads over Angelina Jolie and David Fincher. Jolie apparently wanted the Social Network director for her own Cleopatra project, but was upset with Sony for putting him on Steve Jobs.\n\"Shut Angie down.\"\nAmong other fiery rants, Rudin rages at Jolie's \"rampaging spoiled ego\" after telling Pascal to \"SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS,\" as quoted by Gawker. Fincher later reportedly laughed off a \"WTF\" email from Pascal in reference to rumors of him leaving the Steve Jobs project \u2014 which  turned out to be true . When the project went to Universal , Pascal begged Rudin to let her try to secure it again, says Gawker, but the producer retorts that Pascal had told \"Danny\" [likely new director Danny Boyle] that she doesn't \"believe in this version of\" the movie. Afterwards, Rudin reportedly told Pascal that she's \"behaved abominably\" and \"destroyed [her] relationships with half the town.\"\nIt's been clear for a while that Sorkin's Jobs biopic had hit some bumps in development, but the whole series of leaked emails shows how personal arguments and vendettas can threaten to derail entire movie projects costing tens of millions of dollars.\n","Title":"Leaked Sony emails show torturous process behind Sorkin's Steve Jobs movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","us-world","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
