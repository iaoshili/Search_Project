It could be an X-Files episode storyline, but it's anÂ  Instagram account: minature_xfiles_office . The account's curator has spent the last three months building and outfitting a set for a six-inch Mulder and Scully, before posing them in place to celebrate holidays and talk about unsolved mysteries.\nA photo posted by The Miniature X-Files Office (@miniature_xfiles_office) on\nFeb 20, 2015 at 8:39pm PST\nThe creator says that they put together the set using pieces they created themselves, or purchased from dollhouse miniature stories. The dioramas are correct down to fine details: in the bookshelves are miniature copies of books written by both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, the the corkboard features a picture of a UFO purchased by Mulder in episode \"Deep Throat,\" and secreted in his desk drawer is a shrunken copy of Playboy. In one shot, the office even plays host to the kind of monster the two agents spent the best part of seven seasons chasing.\nThe creator of the office is continuing to post new pictures, but for now, remember. The truth is out there \u2014 and it's tiny.\nA photo posted by The Miniature X-Files Office (@miniature_xfiles_office) on\nDec 9, 2014 at 12:37pm PST\n","Title":"Miniature X-Files office is home to the cutest detectives in the FBI | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
