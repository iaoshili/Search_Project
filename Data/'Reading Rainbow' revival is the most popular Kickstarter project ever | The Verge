{"Main text":"'Reading Rainbow' revival is the most popular Kickstarter project ever\nThe hit children's reading show gained big support from Seth MacFarlane, Veronica Mars, Pebble, and OUYA\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's one for the record books. Reading Rainbow, the popular and critically acclaimed children's educational series from the 1980s, has become the  most popular Kickstarter project yet in terms of number of backers \u2014  91,588 individual contributors as of today at 11AM EST. The campaign, which seeks to bring Reading Rainbow back as a website and app for smartphones and TVs, was launched by longtime series host LeVar Burton in late May . Kickstarter  confirmed the news on  Twitter , noting that it had surpassed the previous record holder, the  Veronica Mars movie, at 91,585 backers.\nBigger than Veronica Mars\nThere are only 48 hours left to go before the Reading Rainbow campaign ends, but the contributions continue to flow in, with $4.5 million raised at the time of this article's publication. While that amount is still considerably less than the most well-funded project on Kickstarter so far (that would be the  over $10 million raised by the  Pebble e-paper smartwatch ), it is enough to make the new Reading Rainbow campaign the fifth best funded to date.\nIn fact, the goodwill for Reading Rainbow's revival seems to be peaking as the project reaches its conclusion, with  Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane pledging to match every dollar raised after $4 million, up to an additional $1 million. On top of that, the other projects in Kickstarter's all-time top five most-funded \u2014 Pebble, the  OUYA Android video game console, Neil Young's new music service \/ device  Pono , and Veronica Mars \u2014 have  donated rewards from their own campaigns to give to Reading Rainbow's latest backers. Burton has said that if Reading Rainbow reaches $5 million by the time the Kickstarter campaign concludes, he will build apps for Android, Xbox, Playstation, Apple TV and Roku, and provide it for free to 7,500 classrooms.\n","Title":"'Reading Rainbow' revival is the most popular Kickstarter project ever | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
