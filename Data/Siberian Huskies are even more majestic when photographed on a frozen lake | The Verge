{"Main text":"Siberian Huskies are even more majestic when photographed on a frozen lake\nIt kind of looks like they're walking on water\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou know that majestic time of day when the cool blue lake outside your window blends with the cool blue horizon off in the distance, and you feel a pleasant sense of calm and self-actualization? No, me neither. But these photographs might help you get there.\nPhotographer Fox Grom recently captured a group of Siberian Huskies playing on a frozen lake inÂ Kirovsk, a town in northern Russia. Because the lake has just begun to thaw, it looks like the dogs are walking on water. They're not, of course, but it's nice to imagine this is a group of magical ghost dogs, just splashing through Earth's icy mist. The captivating, gently tangled colors in the photos don't hurt either.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
