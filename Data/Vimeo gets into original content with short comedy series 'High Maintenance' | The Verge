{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVimeo is the latest video streaming service to get into original content, today announcing that it's ordered six episodes of the short comedy High Maintenance to debut later this year. The show already has 13 episodes that were released independently last year on Vimeo , each running anywhere from around 5 to 15 minutes long. If the name didn't tip you off, the show is centered on a weed dealer, played by Ben Sinclair.\nYou'll likely have to pay to watch\nUnlike Hulu, however, it's likely that you won't just be able to show up to Vimeo and start streaming the new series. High Maintenance will live on Vimeo On Demand, Vimeo's movie rental and sales service. Though pricing is yet to be determined, it seems as though it'll cost something to watch, otherwise it'd just debut on Vimeo proper, where there's no pay wall.\nThis is just the beginning for Vimeo's original content too: it's set aside $10 million to use for licensing content for Vimeo On Demand. Paying per episode is a far different business model than what most streaming services jumping into the original content game are using \u2014 Amazon and Netflix, most notably, both require subscriptions \u2014 so Vimeo's initiative may pan out quite differently. One thing's for certain: if it does sell shows episode by episode, each one better be good.\n","Title":"Vimeo gets into original content with short comedy series 'High Maintenance' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
