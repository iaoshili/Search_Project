{"Main text":"Shyp just fixed the nightmare of online returns\nThe easiest way to return unwanted items ever\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn theory, shopping online couldn\u2019t be easier. You tap a few buttons, something shows up at your house days later, and you move on with your life. In practice, though, it isn\u2019t always that easy \u2014 especially when you\u2019re shopping for clothes. The fit isn\u2019t right, or the color isn\u2019t what you expected, or it turns out you look ridiculous in corduroy. (And you do.) Sometimes you bother to return the item, killing your lunch hour at the post office. Often, though, you shove it in a corner, or under your bed, and tell yourself you\u2019ll ship it back later. You never do.\nWe know this about ourselves, and it may be one reason we don\u2019t shop online more. That on-demand retail is our future seems to be a foregone conclusion, and yet less than 7 percent of all retail sales are e-commerce,  according to the Census Bureau . But this week, I saw an app that could meaningfully notch that number upward.  Shyp , a year-old logistics startup now operating in San Francisco, New York, and Miami, handles all of your returns \u2014 fetching them from your house, packaging them up, and shipping them back to their point of origin \u2014 for a flat $5 fee. And as of today, it will even print out the return label for you.\nLess than 7 percent of all retail sales are e-commerce\nWhen the San Francisco company launched its business last year, it expected to cater to small-scale merchants (think eBay power sellers) and people who wanted to send gifts without traveling to the post office. Those remain its most popular uses. But over time, more people started using Shyp to return things they bought online but didn\u2019t want to ship back themselves. (America!) Online returns now make up 15 percent of Shyp\u2019s business, and so the company decided to build returns into its product. Shyp Returns is a new tab inside the company\u2019s app, which is available for  Android and  iOS .\nHere\u2019s how it works. You download the app, create an account, tap \"add shipment,\" and select the \"returns\" tab. If you\u2019ve already printed out a prepaid return label or if the store you shopped at included one in your order, you can just tap that button and summon a courier to your doorstep. If you shopped at one of 12 big retailers Shyp has integrated with to date \u2014 including Amazon, Target, Zappos, J. Crew, Nordstrom, Banana Republic, and Rent the Runway \u2014 you just tap the retailer and type in your order number. Shyp will print the label for you, come pick up the package, and ship it using whichever service is cheapest.\nIn other words, instead of letting the $100 pair of jeans that don\u2019t fit languish under your bed forever, you can now get 95 percent of your investment back just by mashing your paw on some glass a few times. And Shyp says they expect this will spur people to shop more. \"We see people sending back more and more of these returns,\" says Kevin Gibbon, Shyp\u2019s co-founder and CEO. \"It\u2019s changing the way that they\u2019re shopping online. Instead of going to a mall, now you can try on three or four pairs of shoes to see which ones you like in the comfort of your own home.\"\nShyp is growing 20 percent a month\nGibbon became obsessed with the shipping industry as an eBay power seller in Vancouver, where he somehow earned six figures importing and exporting $100 dudebro Affliction shirts and other high-margin items out of his garage. Shipping is a huge business in this country \u2014 UPS has a market capitalization of $92 billion \u2014 and yet there has been little innovation there since FedEx entered the market in the 1970s.\nToday, Shyp piggybacks on top of those services; one way it makes money is by charging you the retail cost to ship your package, while it pays a lower bulk rate negotiated with the carriers. But one day Shyp could compete with the FedExes of the world more directly. Gibbon says his vision goes far beyond the occasional e-commerce return or holiday gift in the mail; Shyp is growing 20 percent or more each month, he says, and at that rate he\u2019ll probably soon have a lot of venture capital to get him where he\u2019s going. (It\u2019s raised $12.1 million so far.)\nFor now, Shyp\u2019s appeal lies primarily in the extreme convenience (I used it successfully to return some review hardware to a big manufacturer) and low price. That $5 fee isn't profitable for Shyp, though, raising the question of how sustainable it is. For now, it's a way to attract new customers. Gibbon says the price will \"evolve,\" which is a startup term meaning \"increase.\" So let\u2019s enjoy it while it lasts \u2014 and maybe spruce up your wardrobe while you do.\n","Title":"Shyp just fixed the nightmare of online returns | The Verge","Tags":["apps","report","tech","front-page\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"sf.racked"]}
