{"Main text":"The Universal Record lets you play any song on a turntable\nOld school meets new school\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you own a record player, you've probably wanted to play a larger portion of your music collection on it to take advantage of that classic listening experience, and soon that may be possible. An artist named Jesse England has created theÂ  Universal Record , a device that let's you play music from your phone to your turntable. Consisting of a Bluetooth audio receiver and an acoustic transducer that vibrates the vinyl disc to simulate record grooves, the Universal Record plays like any other record, except it can play any song off any audio source that can be connected via Bluetooth. England hasn't said if and when he will put the Universal Record on sale, but we definitely want one.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
