{"Main text":"Watch OK Go's trippy new music video for 'The Writing's On the Wall'\nSeriously where do those stairs go?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOK Go has a niche. Like their music or don't (spoiler: I don't), you can't deny the incredible ingenuity of the band's music videos. It's been committed to the form for years, churning out YouTube hit after YouTube hit on the back of bizarre, complicated, difficult videos. There was  the treadmill video . And the  Rube Goldberg machine . And the one  with all the dogs . And now, for the band's new song, \"The Writing's On the Wall\" off the upcoming album Hungry Ghosts, comes an incredible four-minute, one-take video full of optical illusions, crazy camera tricks, and one giant warehouse.\nIt doesn't hurt that \"The Writing's on the Wall\" is a half-decent song, too. But you'll forget the song long before you'll stop watching the video. And then watching it again because what is that mirror even doing there and how is that even possible?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
