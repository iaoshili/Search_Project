{"Main text":"The NSA wants tech companies to give it 'front door' access to encrypted data\nNSA director suggested tech companies could provide an encryption key in pieces\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe National Security Agency is embroiled in a battle with tech companies over access to encrypted data that would allow it to spy (more easily) on millions of Americans and international citizens. Last month, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple  urged the Obama administration to put an end to the NSA's bulk collection of metadata. The NSA, on the other hand, continues to parade the idea that the government needs access to encrypted data on smartphones and other devices to track and prevent criminal activity. Now, NSA director Michael S. Rogers says he might have a solution.\nDuring a recent speech at Princeton University, Rogers suggested tech companies could create a master multi-part encryption key capable of unlocking any device,  The Washington Post reports . That way, if the key were broken into pieces, no single person would have the ability to use it.\n\"I don't want a back door.\"\n\"I don\u2019t want a back door,\" Rogers said. \"I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks. Big locks.\"\nThe suggestion comes as Congress considers a new framework for handling encrypted data. Government and law enforcement officials say total encryption could stand in the way of national security operations, while leaders in the tech industry and advocacy groups say the government shouldn't have complete, unobstructed access to citizens' private communications.\nDuring this year's South by Southwest festival, Edward Snowden  held a secret meeting in which he said tech companies needed to take a stronger position against NSA surveillance. He said companies should adopt more secure technology that could block surveillance altogether, and championed end-to-end encryption, which would mean no one except the sender and recipient would have access to private communications.\nA master encryption key still creates vulnerabilities\nRogers suggests the adoption of \"front door\" access will allow for essential security measures while keeping data safe from hackers or an outside attack. But opponents of the idea note that even broken into pieces, a master digital key creates security flaws. \"There\u2019s no way to do this where you don\u2019t have unintentional vulnerabilities,\" Donna Dodson, chief cyber­security adviser at the Commerce Department\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technologies,  told the Post .\n","Title":"The NSA wants tech companies to give it 'front door' access to encrypted data | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","national-security"]}
