{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix wants to make sure you remember to check out Marco Polo the minute it's available; to that end, the company is testing a new Twitter ad that will send you a reminder on or around 3:01AM ET \/ 12:01AM PT next Friday, December 12th.\nThe Khan requests your presence in the court. All episodes of #MarcoPolo arrive on Netflix Dec. 12. http:\/\/t.co\/IFPOiv5PeL\n\u2014 Marco Polo (@MarcoPoloMP) December 4, 2014\nDoing so will prompt you to tweet the following message from your own account: \"On 12\/12, I will face the great Kublai Khan. Join my mission: @MarcoPoloMP premiere #NetflixReminder http:\/\/nflx.it\/reminder\" (yep, that's an Italian top-level domain \u2014 appropriate given the subject matter). It isn't clear if the tweet is required to sign up, but however obnoxious it is,  people seem to be playing along .\nAccording to a statement by Netflix ( via The Next Web ), \"The reminder will come in as an @Reply from the @MarcoPoloMP Twitter account, directed at each user who has opted in, as soon as the episodes are available at 12:01AM Pacific time on December 12, and will include a custom video message from the cast.\" It's a cute concept and undoubtedly will be repeated in the future ( hello, House of Cards ), but please don't require me to be an extension of the advertising campaign.\n","Title":"Netflix wants to tweet you a reminder when Marco Polo is available | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
