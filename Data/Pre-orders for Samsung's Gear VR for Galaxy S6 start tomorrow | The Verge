Today Samsung announced the device will be available for pre-order from Best Buy starting tomorrow. On May 8th, you'll be able to buy it online from Best Buy or directly from Samsung, or in Best Buy stores on May 15th.\nThe device, designed with Oculus, isÂ  a noticeable step up from the last version of the Samsung headset. That version worked with the Galaxy Note 4, but the S6, a more mainstream device, could insure that the new generation of Gear VR attracts more customers. Samsung says, like the previous Gear VR, the Gear VR Innovator Edition will cost $199.\nUpdate: Included pricing from Samsung.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Samsung's Gear VR headset\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
