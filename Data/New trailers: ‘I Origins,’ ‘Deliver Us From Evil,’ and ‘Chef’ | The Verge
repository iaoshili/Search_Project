{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFrom the latest comic book movie to a mesmerizing science fiction mindtrip , there\u2019s a lot to choose from in theaters this weekend. What else is coming? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nI Origins\nMichael Pitt (Boardwalk Empire) stars in this science fiction story about a young scientist who makes a point of eschewing the spiritual \u2014 until an unexpected discovery forces him to rethink it all. The film premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, but you\u2019ll be able to see it in theaters on July 18th.\nDeliver Us From Evil\nThe last time writer-director Scott Derrickson stepped behind the camera the result was the terrifying Sinister. This time he directs Eric Bana as a cop that finds himself up against the forces of demonic possession, but it doesn\u2019t look like things have gotten any less creepy.\nChef\nJon Favreau has become known as the director of big-budget films like Iron Man and Cowboys & Aliens, but his latest project represents a return to his indie roots. He writes, directs, and stars in Chef, which premiered at SXSW to universal acclaim. Like the filmmaker\u2019s very best work, it looks to be funny, accessible, and poignant all at the same time.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018I Origins,\u2019 \u2018Deliver Us From Evil,\u2019 and \u2018Chef\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
