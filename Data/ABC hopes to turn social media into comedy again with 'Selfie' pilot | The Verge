{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe word \"selfie\" has been integrated into our culture so much that it's in the dictionary, and now it could end up inspiring a TV show. ABC has ordered a pilot for Selfie from Suburgatory writer Emily Kapnek, and while it's still a long way from a series order,  Entertainment Weekly shared the show's gripping logline:\nComedy inspired by My Fair Lady tells the story of a self-obsessed 20-something woman who is more concerned with \u2018likes\u2019 than being liked. After suffering a very public and humiliating breakup, she becomes the subject of a viral video and suddenly has more social media \u2018followers\u2019 than she ever imagined \u2014 but for all the wrong reasons. She enlists the help of a marketing expert at her company to help repair her tarnished image.\nIt's not surprising to see social media trends inspiring TV shows, but many of these shows have failed quickly in the past. In 2011 CBS tried to cash in with the sitcom $#*! My Dad Says, based off of the widely popular Twitter account and book by Justin Halpern \u2014 but it was canceled after just one season. Shows like these might be fated to fail because the shelf life of a social media trend tends to be a lot shorter than that of a developed TV show. Whether Selfie manages to avoid that fate remains to be seen, but we just hope no one tries to pilot shows titled #Hashtag or Twerk next.\nImage: Trent Wolbe\n","Title":"ABC hopes to turn social media into comedy again with 'Selfie' pilot | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
