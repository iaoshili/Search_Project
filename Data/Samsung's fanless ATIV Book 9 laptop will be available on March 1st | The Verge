{"Main text":"Samsung's fanless ATIV Book 9 laptop will be available on March 1st\nIt looked pretty good at CES, and now it's (almost) here\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung's new ATIV Book 9 was announced this year at CES, and now it has a release date. The all-aluminum ultrabook, which looks like  Samsung's strongest answer to the MacBook Air yet , will be available beginning March 1st. At  0.46-inches thick and 2.09 pounds, it's the lightest laptop in the Book 9 line. Visually, it's similar to other offerings in Samsung's recent lineup, and features Intel's Broadwell Core M processor. Samsung is also paying more attention to audio this time: the laptop features a built-in Wolfson lossless audio player and native FLAC support. And there's one more big change: the ATIV Book 9 is fanless \u2014 something Apple can't say yet about even its lightest laptop.\nThe 2015 Ativ Book 9 starts at $1,199.99 with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, and goes for $1,399.99 with 8GB memory and a larger 256GB SSD.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
