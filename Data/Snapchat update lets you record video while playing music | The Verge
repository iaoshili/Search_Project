{"Main text":"Snapchat update lets you record video while playing music\nThere's no need for a second audio source anymore\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSnapchat has finally figured out how to integrate music with its service. Thanks to an update currently rolling out on iOS, Snapchat users can record video while still playing music on their phones. Previously when you pressed record, any music playing would automatically pause, an issue that still plagues Instagram, Vine, and even the default video camera on the iPhone. Snapchat's update will let you record music from any music app, and reduces the need for a second audio source to record music from. The update \u2014 version 9.2.0 \u2014 has not appeared on Android as of yet.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
