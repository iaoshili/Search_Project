{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThunder Levin is in on the joke. The improbably named writer of SyFy\u2019s  notorious Sharknado has been making tongue-in-cheek disasters since 2008\u2019s Mutant Zombie Vampires From The Hood. But it wasn\u2019t until last year\u2019s Jaws-meets-Twister disaster film that Levin hit pay dirt, attracting millions of viewers to a story that he has never described as anything but ridiculous. This year he hopes to do it again \u2014 the fan-named  Sharknado 2: The Second One debuts Wednesday night on SyFy.\nThere\u2019s a plot, probably, but we had other questions for the screenwriter. Levin, who is very good company, sat down with us at Comic-Con this week to talk about Sharknado\u2019s hidden activism, its frozen cast, and whether he would ever write a script for Arachnoquake. He also tells a story about Richard Dreyfuss that we will be sharing with our friends for quite some time.\nInterview has been edited and condensed.\nSo who came up with Sharknado, anyway?\nThunder Levin: The guy who thought of Sharknado was (director) Anthony Ferrante and one of his writing partners on another film. They were writing Leprechaun\u2019s Revenge and they just threw in this line about some other town \u2014 just a reference, it wasn\u2019t even in the movie \u2014 It was like \u2018Yeah, we don\u2019t want to be like that town. They never recovered after the sharknado.\u2019 And that\u2019s just all there was to it. Then the guys at SyFy said, \"Sharknado! We should make that as a movie!\u2019 And they and the Asylum got together, and I\u2019d made another film for the Asylum, and they liked that. So they said, we want you to write Sharknado. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I\u2019d ever heard.\nIt seems like you were able to give us the over-the-top movie people wanted after they heard the title.\nIt was a matter of walking the line. We couldn\u2019t do it straight. But on the other hand you don\u2019t want to stray into farce or out-and-out comedy. If the actors start winking at the camera or cracking jokes, it stops working. So as a matter of having the characters be immersed in the moment while still letting the audience know you\u2019re in on the joke.\n\"You don't want to stray into farce.\"\nSharknado really seemed to hit a nerve on Twitter , where I live.\nSo you\u2019re a digital avatar?\nI\u2019m one of those people.\nSo if I hold a magnet to you, the image scatters?\nYes. I\u2019m an algorithm. So one of the interesting things about Sharknado is that every time it aired for the first few times, more people watched it . I assumed it was people just enjoyed saying \"Sharknado.\" Do you have any other theories?\nThe movie is just fun. You don\u2019t have to think about it. Last summer there were a lot of big blockbusters that were very dark. They all made tons of money, but nothing exploded, nothing captured the public imagination. Then we came along with our silly little movie that was just loads of fun, and we didn\u2019t take it too seriously, and no one else had to take it too seriously to enjoy it. The fact that you weren\u2019t taking it too seriously let you in on the joke.\nThe people who were saying \"Hey, it was raining, and now it\u2019s not raining, and now it\u2019s raining again!\" or \"Oh, sharks can\u2019t be sucked up into a tornado!\" They\u2019re just missing the point.\nDid you take any steps this time to be more consistent about when it was or was not raining?\nWell that wasn\u2019t a story thing, that was just the budget! Anthony was shooting for 18 days in LA, and they happened to be 18 sunny days, and he only had so many garden hoses he could be spraying people with water. I suppose from a filmmaking standpoint that\u2019s a legitimate gripe, but it\u2019s just an artifact of the fact we\u2019re doing a $100 million film for less than most films\u2019 catering budget for one day.\n\"We're doing a $100 million film for less than most films' catering budget for one day.\"\nOne of the reasons the second movie looks a lot bigger and a lot more expensive is simply we were shooting in February and March of the worst winter the East Coast has had in recent memory. So the weather actually helped us! Because it looked crappy. It looked like there was a tornado rolling into town. I mean, it was hell for us \u2014 we were shooting a movie that takes place in July, and it was 5 degrees out! The day we were shooting in Citi Field, I\u2019ve never been that cold in my life, and I\u2019ve been to Minneapolis in February. The cast\u2019s jaws wouldn\u2019t work right, it was so cold. They couldn\u2019t speak properly \u2014 they sounded like folks who have gone deaf. So they had to bring in little portable heaters that would blow warm air on their faces from just off camera, just so they could get the dialogue out.\nThere\u2019s something poetic about actors in a shark film finding that their jaws don\u2019t work.\nI met Richard Dreyfuss this morning \u2014 he\u2019s never heard of it. I walked up and said \"Hi, I wrote Sharknado!\" He said, \"What\u2019s Sharknado!\" I said, it\u2019s a silly movie about sharks falling from the sky.\nYou should have said, \"It\u2019s a vast improvement on the idea of Jaws.\"\nI said we paid homage to Jaws. Then we started talking about history \u2014 apparently he was going to be going on Fox News explaining American history to right-wingers who don\u2019t quite get it.\nThat\u2019s doing the Lord\u2019s work, explaining history on Fox News.\nI didn\u2019t know he was such a big history buff. And I\u2019ve actually written a movie trilogy that\u2019s sort of about the American revolution, and I wanted to talk to him about it. But he had to go on TV.\nMaybe you could get Richard for Sharknado 3.\nWell we talked about it for this one, and it would have been brilliant except that  he\u2019d done the same thing basically in Piranha . So we felt like it would just be repeating what somebody else was making fun of.\nAnthony said after the first Sharknado that to do a sequel, you\u2019d really have to \"up the ante.\" In the first one you\u2019ve got people throwing bombs at sharks, taking a chainsaw through a shark. How do you up the ante in Sharknado 2?\nWell, SyFy wanted it to take place in New York City, which I loved, because I\u2019m from New York. New York City boy, born and bred. So that in and of itself raised the stakes a lot. Having a disaster film set in New York, there are all these iconic landmarks, it\u2019s the capital of the world \u2014 you probably shouldn\u2019t write that, but that\u2019s certainly the way New Yorkers think of it. So that did a lot for us right there. And then it was just a matter of trying to be bigger and better.\n\"We just went with the assumption that people who would be watching this knew what a sharknado was.\"\nI think just inevitably having sharknados rampaging through New York City is going to make it a bigger thing. And the fact that we didn\u2019t need to explain it this time. We just went with the assumption that people who would be watching this knew what a sharknado was. So a lot of the build-up, a lot of the exposition, we didn\u2019t need to bother with it. We just got right into it. Almost from the first minute of the film, shit\u2019s happening. And it just never lets up.\nWasn\u2019t the charm of Sharknado that you didn\u2019t have to explain it? That the whole movie was in the title?\nWell that\u2019s true, but I felt it was incumbent upon me to to provide some sort of rationale for how this would happen. I said oh there was a hurricane and it was pushing all the sharks north, and tornadoes forming over the ocean. We don\u2019t even go that far in the second one. Why are there sharks in New York harbor? We never answer that question. There they are!\nWell with climate change, you can put a shark anywhere these days and people accept it.\n\"Why are people laughing at our very important documentary?\"\nSee, this is what I don\u2019t understand. Why are people laughing at our very important documentary about global warming?\nI think it would be an incredible achievement if Sharknado 2 was the film that finally got people serious about the global warming crisis. You never know when the tipping point is going to come.\nLet\u2019s hope so!\nAnything else you want to say about Sharknado 2?\nWednesday night SyFy, 9 o\u2019clock, tune in. Check your local listings.\nActually, I do have one other question. There have been calls for similar animal disaster movies \u2014 Sharkalanche, Tsharknami, Arachnoquake \u2014 do any of those have any appeal to you as a screenwriter?\nWe\u2019re done. We did Sharknado. What more is there?\n","Title":"Richard Dreyfuss has never heard of it: talking to the creator of 'Sharknado 2' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment","sdcc-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5695384"]}
