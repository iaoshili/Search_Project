{"Main text":"\u2014  All Things D, April 2013\nSpeaking to analysts on an earnings call for its first-quarter results, Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes threw cold water on the idea that it might offer HBO to consumers via broadband without having to subscribe to a larger cable or satellite TV package first.\n\"We don't think it makes sense,\" Bewkes said, adding that the target market is \"not significantly large enough to be attractive at this point.\"\n\u2014  Los Angeles Times, May 2013\nThere's little chance that HBO will offer its content online to non-TV subscribers in the U.S. any time soon.\nHome Box Office Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler, in remarks at Nomura's Media & Telecommunications Summit in New York on Thursday, said the company is focused on getting more U.S. households to subscribe rather than letting people pay to watch its content online without buying a satellite or cable TV package.\n\"For right now, we have the right model for our business,\" he said. \"There are 70 million homes in the U.S. that don't have HBO. We think there's a lot of opportunity in that 70 million.\"\n\u2014  Los Angeles Times, May 2013\nHBO has long said that it has no plans to sell subscriptions directly over the internet, but Netflix CFO David Wells suggested Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs conference that the cable channel should rethink that decision. \"We believe that if they were direct-to-consumer, there would be materially more subscribers that would pay for it in the U.S.,\" Wells said.\n\u2014  Gigaom, September 2013\nHBO offered a glimmer of hope last month by quietly trialling a product to new customers in selected US cities with Comcast, America's biggest cable company: a $50-per-month \"internet plus\" package combining broadband access, broadcast TV and HBO. ...\nYet on the Nov. 6 earnings call for its parent company, Time Warner, executives sounded decidedly lukewarm about the potential of the product. \"It's a new offer. It's fairly targeted. It's a pretty limited video offering, not in the sense of HBO which is a fantastic video and broadband offerings. So it won't be attractive for most people,\" Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said.\n\u2014  Quartz, November 2013\n2014\n\"HBO Go is value added - what you want to watch,\" Plepler said, in response to questions about unbundling HBO Go. \"Right now, that's the right model for us. Are we always thinking about optionality, of course we are always thinking about optionality... if the arithmetic changes and made sense in a different way we are not going to be caught without the ability to pivot.\"\n","Title":"How HBO warmed up to online subscriptions: an oral history | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","entertainment","tech"]}
