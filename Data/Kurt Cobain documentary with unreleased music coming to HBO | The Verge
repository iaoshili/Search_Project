{"Main text":"Kurt Cobain documentary with unreleased music coming to HBO\n'Montage of Heck' will premiere next year\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA Kurt Cobain documentary is coming to HBO next year with never-before-heard music recorded by the late Nirvana frontman. The \"first fully-authorized\" documentary about Cobain, titled Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, comes from director Brett Morgen. But unlike other films dealing with the rock star, Morgen's documentary will contain recordings and home movies of Cobain that even Nirvana's most dedicated fans haven't heard or seen.\n\"Once I stepped into Kurt's archive, I discovered over 200 hours of unreleased music and audio, a vast array of art projects (oil paintings, sculptures), countless hours of never-before-seen home movies, and over 4000 pages of writings that together help paint an intimate portrait of an artist who rarely revealed himself to the media,\" said Morgen.\nFor the first time, HIS story will be told. #KurtCobain : Montage of Heck comes to @HBO in 2015. @nirvana @brettmorgen pic.twitter.com\/nXFlzFxf7v\n\u2014 HBO Documentaries (@HBODocs) November 25, 2014\nStepping into those vast archives meant earning the cooperation of Cobain's family. Morgen worked with the family for eight years, and as a result his documentary is the first to gain their full consent. Kurt's daughter Frances Bean Cobain even has an executive producer credit on Montage of Heck, which takes its name from a mixtape Cobain made in the '80s. Courtney Love also contributed to the project,  according to Frances . Love \"provided documentation, photos, home movies, artifacts, and was interviewed in depth.\" The film will premiere next year on HBO before expanding internationally with the help of Universal Pictures. HBO also has a working relationship with Dave Grohl, who was Nirvana's drummer before Cobain's tragic death.\nCorrection: This article originally stated that Courtney Love was not involved in the making of Montage of Heck. She indeed contributed to the film's development and the story has been updated to reflect this.\n","Title":"Kurt Cobain documentary with unreleased music coming to HBO | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
