{"Main text":"The new Poltergeist trailer is basically just a collage of horrifying images\nThe remake is out this July\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe already knew that the Gil Kenan-directed Poltergeist remake was going to be pretty scary. The movie's  first trailer showed us a nice suburban town and a happy family besieged by a deranged jack-in-the-box. Now, the film's second trailer ups the horror ante with brief glimpses of terrified faces, bloody hallucinations, objects moving on their own, and lots of mysterious shadows.\nThe movie \u2014 about a family living in a house built on a graveyard \u2014 will star Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt as parents trying to save their daughter from the cold grip of evil. Bloody noses and malfunctioning smartphones are scary enough to entice us. How Kenan and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire will  bring a 1982 plot into 2015 is another story.\nPoltergeist arrives this July.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
