{"Main text":"Grand Theft Auto V will let you direct your own in-game movies on PC\nThe definitive version is almost here\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGrand Theft Auto V finally hits the PC this week, and the new version comes with a great new feature: a video feature that lets you easily share your exploits in Los Santos. Called the Rockstar Editor, the tool lets you record gameplay with a simple button click, and then customize it with multiple camera angles, filters, and even your own audio.\nIt also includes a feature called \"Director Mode,\" which Rockstar says \"allows you to stage creative moviemaking sequences from a cast of characters ranging from familiar faces from story mode, to pedestrians and even animals.\" When GTA V first hit Xbox One and PS4, usersÂ  captured some amazing images using the game's photo-sharing feature, so we can only imagine what they'll be able to do with this \u2014 and at 60 frames per second , the player-made creations will certainly look great.\nThe game launches on PC tomorrow, April 14th.\nTo tease the new editor, Rockstar commissioned YouTube creator 8-bit Bastard to make the first, public in-game video.
