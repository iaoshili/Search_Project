{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs usual with HTC, the next great Android smartphone from the Taiwanese company has apparently been leaked days ahead of its official announcement. The guys over at Mobile Geeks have come across online listings of HTC's new flagship Â \u2014 expected to be called the One M9 \u2014 which provide a full set of specifications and press images alongside a price of 749 euros in Germany. There are no surprises in the enumerated specs, which include a 2GHz octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage plus microSD expansion. The UltraPixel camera is said to have been moved to the front of the device while the rear features a new 20-megapixel sensor, housed inside a camera module that protrudes slightly from the phone's body. Android 5.0 Lollipop is listed as the operating system, along with a new Sense 7 software skin.\nTwo new colorways are shown by the leaked pictures, one combining gold and silver for a two-tone look and the other opting for a more demure gunmetal gray. Neither shows any great departures from the HTC One we know today. The BoomSound speakers are as prominent as ever, framing a 5-inch display with 1080p resolution, and the overall aesthetic appears to have remained largely unchanged. The power button seems to have been moved to the side with this new phone, which is a trend embraced by almost all smartphone makers (LG prefers to put the power and volume buttons on the back).\nThe One M9 is set to launch on March 1st during MWC in Barcelona, and we'll be there to cover it live. Tune in then for the full official details.\n","Title":"HTC One M9 pictures and specs leak out | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech","mwc-2015"]}
