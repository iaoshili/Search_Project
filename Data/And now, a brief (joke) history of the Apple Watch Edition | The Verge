{"Main text":"And now, a brief (joke) history of the Apple Watch Edition\nRoss Miller owes me two American dollars for posting this\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYesterday, we  learned quite a bit about the Apple Watch . Today, I made some really bad dad jokes on Twitter, reinterpreting the development of the Apple Watch through the eyes of one of the greatest poets of the last 20th century. My friend and fellow editor Ross Miller  offered me one dollar to post my lyrical history on this website . Later, he upped his offer to  two real, physical dollars . Despite my reservations, I do like the idea of being paid in hard currency (it's better than Venmo, which Ross once made me use even though he knew that I am An Old).\nTherefore, prepare for a dad joke. I'm sorry.\n0\/ And now, a brief history of the development of the Apple Watch Edition.\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 11, 2015\n1\/ Things are pretty good at Apple, but...\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 11, 2015\n2\/ Apple halts the direction of Apple's design by pushing out Scott Forstall\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 11, 2015\n3\/ A new era at Apple begins where everybody works together more in a spirit of openness\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 11, 2015\n4\/ Different teams are able to hear each other.\n\u2014 Dieter Bohn (@backlon) March 11, 2015\n5\/ Tim Cook coldly manages manufacturing, enabling efficiences in high end materials like gold.
