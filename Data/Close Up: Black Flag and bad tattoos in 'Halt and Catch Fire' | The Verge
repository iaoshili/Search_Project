{"Main text":"24 Comments\nWe love TV and we love recaps, but a lot of times it\u2019s not the big-picture plot developments that make a show great. It\u2019s the little things; the details in the dialogue, set design, props, and performance. With Close Up, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the coolest moments and most interesting details in some of our favorite shows. Today we\u2019re looking at the third episode of Halt and Catch Fire: \u201CHigh Plains Hardware.\u201D\nLast week IBM went after Cardiff Electric where it hurts: revenue. After losing most of its customers to Big Blue, Cardiff needs to cut overhead, and the episode starts with Gordon laying off an array of different employees. It\u2019s not just awkward; it also creates a manpower problem. Joe\u2019s big vision is to build a \u201Cportable\u201D computer, but several top engineers have been let go and the team is scrambling. Meanwhile, on the business side everyone\u2019s trying to find additional funding: Joe through a venture capitalist, and Nathan Cardiff and Bosworth from a rich socialite. Both sides manage to foil the other\u2019s attempts (Joe through much more manipulative means than the others), but the end result is the same: with no money, Joe proposes that Cardiff create a prototype on their own dime, and then go out to investors when they have something to show.\nGordon\u2019s wife Donna demonstrates her engineering prowess by solving what everyone else at the office seems to think is an unsolvable circuit-board design problem, but even then Gordon needs to get into a car accident before he has the guts to push away the naysayers and embrace the bold ideas his wife is generating. Meanwhile, Cameron continues to struggle, unable to find a groove and start cranking on the code that is at the very core of the PC clone project itself. She\u2019s crashing at the office, unravelling at every turn, and partying with some local punks doesn\u2019t help. Once again, she looks to Joe \u2014 or more specifically, sleeping with Joe \u2014 to clear her head and get things moving again.\nJoe Macmillan, meet Patrick Bateman\nBrainstorming on the portable computer project, Joe looks at a bunch of competitor\u2019s machines while standing in his living room. Naked. From the period music to the stark, meticulous set design, it immediately calls to mind Mary Harron\u2019s American Psycho. Adapted from the Brett Easton Ellis novel of the same name, Psycho starred Christian Bale as a 1980s Wall Street type that just happened to kill a lot of people on the side.\nBale\u2019s Patrick Bateman was also obsessed with the pop culture of the time, specifically artists like Huey Lewis and the News and Phil Collins. Joe, on the other hand, is listening to \"Are \u2018Friends\u2019 Electric?\" by Tubeway Army. It\u2019s an icy slice of synthy new-wave, perfectly matched to Joe himself \u2014 and if the vocals sound familiar while the band name doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s a reason for that. After two albums the lead singer of Tubeway Army decided to release music under his own name instead: Gary Numan.\nTHE MANY FLAVORS OF RANGER SODA\nLast week we took a look at the house beverage of Halt and Catch Fire, Ranger Soda. Cameron was seen chugging Ranger Orange at several points in the show, but here we learn that there are other Ranger fans and that there\u2019s also a lemon-lime flavor. What\u2019s next? Grape, mango, strawberry? Is there a Slusho variant? And what does it all mean? Only series creators Chris Rogers and Chris Cantwell know for sure.\nThis hair must be stopped\nAjax is one of the alley punks Cameron runs into before deciding to throw a hotel party with her first paycheck. His schtick alone is obnoxious enough. \"Work? Like a job?\" he asks when Cameron mentions she\u2019s employed nearby. \"The day I sell out and get a job is the day I die. The materialistic greed hamsters spinning their wheels.\" Okay.\nBut it\u2019s his proto-mullet that\u2019s really offensive. Landing somewhere between accident and cruel prank, it\u2019s a follicular abomination, and while the \u201980s certainly had more than its fair share of fashion faux pas, Ajax takes things to an entirely new level.\nIt does a body good\nIn the middle of the hotel party, Cameron takes a swig of vodka and catches a commercial for milk on the television. \"It tastes great,\" says the tagline, but this is a rather mellow version of what was essentially an entire cottage industry of bizarre 1980s milk commercials. The big slogan at the time was \"Milk: it does a body good,\" and spots sponsored by the National Dairy Board saw little girls dressed up as Hollywood starlets, young boys as bloated muscle men, and lots of weird old-man voices dubbed onto youngsters of all kinds. Check some of them out here \u2014 and realize just how good we had it when \"Got milk?\" took over.\nBlack Flag and bad tattoos\nOur good friend Ajax is super edgy, so to go along with his sweet haircut he does things like use a Bic pen and needle to tattoo \"eat me\" on his arm. Then to be even more charming, his offers to give Cameron a tattoo of her own. Shockingly, it\u2019s fairly legible, but then again what he\u2019s drawing isn\u2019t that complex: it\u2019s the logo for the hardcore punk band Black Flag.\nOriginally formed in 1976, Black Flag was famously fronted by Henry Rollins for many years before the group called it quits in 1986. The inevitable reunions (sans Rollins) have followed in recent years (with dueling lawsuits), but the group\u2019s real legacy is in the influence it\u2019s had on the genre and on an entire generation of musicians. Everyone from Kurt Cobain to Tool\u2019s Maynard James Keenan have listed the band as a major influence, and SST Records \u2014 the label that was founded to release Black Flag\u2019s records \u2014 ended up putting out albums from the likes of Hüsker Dü, Soundgarden, and Sonic Youth.\nWhat did you think of the latest episode of Halt and Catch Fire, and what were some of your favorite details?
