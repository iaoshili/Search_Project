{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou can now watch acclaimed South Korean director Bong Joon-ho's slick, post-apocalyptic sci-fi film Snowpiercer right at home \u2014 just two weeks after it hit US theaters for the first time. That's an extremely rare move for a film such as this, which has a sizable budget ($80 million), rave reviews ( such as our own ), and buzz at the theaters.\nBut Snowpiercer, which follows a band of impoverished underclass survivors led by Chris Evans (Captain America) as they fight their way to the front of a train that houses the remnants of humanity after an ice age, at first opened in just eight screens in the US. Before that, the film was a hit internationally,  according to The Los Angeles Times ; it's drawn over $80 million overseas, with most coming from South Korea after its 2013 release.     \n\"One way or the other, we\u2019re going to find you somewhere.\"\nThe move's a gamble taken by its distributor, Radius-TWC, a small division within The Weinstein Company known for releasing on multiple formats. Tom Quinn, co-president of Radius-TWC tells The Los Angeles Times that \"We expect for it to work theatrically, and we expect it to work on VOD. We hope that they can enhance each other.\"\nHe added: \"The motto at Radius is \u2018a screen is a screen is a screen' ... We\u2019re screen-agnostic, and as consumer habits change, film audiences today are becoming screen-promiscuous. Starting Friday, 85 million-plus consumers will have access to Snowpiercer on VOD. The film will be more widely available than every other film on screen this weekend combined. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to find you somewhere.\"\nHowever the experiment turns out, the good news is that releasing the film on Video On Demand,  Amazon ,  iTunes , and  Google Play makes it a whole lot easier for you to see Snowpiercer. If you'd rather get the full experience, the film has expanded to 325 screens around the country, meaning you should be able to find it in most urban centers, too.\n","Title":"Post-apocalyptic thriller 'Snowpiercer' available for download just two weeks after release | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
