{"Main text":"Chris Hansen is using Kickstarter to revive To Catch a Predator\nLet's all have a seat\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChris Hansen is  heading to Kickstarter to create a new version of To Catch a Predator. The series, which involved Hansen confronting men who sought out underage sex partners, ended in 2007, but now Hansen is looking for $75,000 in funding to bring a new version of it online.  According to the Los Angeles Times , the new show will be called Hansen vs. Predator and will debut online before later being sold to TV networks. Hansen says that he decided crowdfunding was \"the best way\" to get the series made, though it's very possible that networks just shot him down.\n\"From a technology standpoint, the landscape has really changed.\"\n\"There is a pent-up demand from viewers for another investigation,\" Hansen tells the Times. \"And from a technology standpoint, the landscape has really changed since we did the last one.\" The new series sounds as though it'll be about the same as the old one, involving hidden cameras and online stings. \"When we did it before, there were chat rooms on AOL and Yahoo,\" Hansen says. \"Now there are 22 ways to communicate online.\"\nKickstarter is a natural place for Hansen to go. For one, Predator is an investigative series that's very much about the use of the internet, so online audiences may be more receptive. But moreover, Hansen's image and catchphrase (\"Have a seat\") have lived on as memes online. Other properties with cult followings \u2014 like Veronica Mars \u2014 have already shown that crowdfunding can be used to their advantage. Predator was a ratings star on TV, too, so there's a good chance that Hansen will find plenty of old fans willing to fund more episodes.\nOf course, the real reason that Predator is going online may be the same reason that NBC stopped making it in the first place. The show drew plenty of controversy during its run, with claims of entrapment, conflicts of interest, and public shaming. One target of a Predator investigation  killed himself during a filming of the show , when police arrived at his home after he failed to show up at the location of the sting. Advertisers eventually  grew wary of being associated with Predator \u2014 seemingly as did NBC.\nThose associations won't be a problem online, where Hansen will be able to find support from individuals who don't have those concerns. Naturally, they'll be able to get T-shirts, coffee mugs, and personalized voicemails in return. The campaign  went live on Wednesday, April 15th.\nUpdate April 15th, 12:55PM ET: This story has been updated to note that the campaign for Hansen vs. Predator is now live. This story has also been updated to reflect the campaign's funding goal of $75,000, rather than the $400,000 goal that was previously reported.\n","Title":"Chris Hansen is using Kickstarter to revive To Catch a Predator | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
