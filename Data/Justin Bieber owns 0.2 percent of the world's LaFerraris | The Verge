(The LaFerrari-based  FXX K is more ridiculous, but it's restricted to track duty.) Only 499 LaFerraris will ever exist. Build slots sold out in 2013, the same year the car was announced.\nJustin Bieber owns one. Let me spell that out more clearly: Justin Bieber owns 0.2 percent of the entire global stock of LaFerraris.  From a recent interview in USA Today :\nQ: Speaking of driving cars quickly, what are you driving these days?\nA: I'm still driving my Ferrari. It's a 458 Italia, and I just got the LaFerrari (the company's exclusive $1.4 million supercar), it should be coming soon.\nIn general, I fully support wealthy individuals spending their hard-earned money any way they please \u2014 and that includes Justin Bieber, who just  endured a roast on Comedy Central surrounded by dozens of other wealthy people. But the LaFerrari, as with Ferrari's other ultra-exclusive limited-production cars like the Enzo Ferrari before it, requires Ferrari's blessing to buy. You need to be more than merely wealthy; you need to be a friend of the brand, preferably with a garage full of other Ferraris and a tendency to espouse your love for all things Maranello. After all, there are thousands of millionaires and billionaires around the globe, and only 499 LaFerraris. Someone has to make the tough choices.\nYou can't just buy one, there's a process\nIt would be tough to argue that Justin Bieber, who is only 21 years of age, has had enough time on this planet to become a Ferrari superfan \u2014 the kind that owns five or 10 or 20 Ferraris of various vintages and makes regular trips to the factory and to track events. Those people exist, and they're considerably older. It's more likely that he bought a used LaFerrari outside of the mothership's purview; they've been showing up on the market for well above list price  since early last year , and Biebs should be able to swallow the cost pretty easily.  Forbes says he made $80 million last year alone.\nCalvin Klein ads seem to pay alright.\nVerge Video: A tour of the New York International Auto Show\n","Title":"Justin Bieber owns 0.2 percent of the world's LaFerraris | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","transportation"]}
