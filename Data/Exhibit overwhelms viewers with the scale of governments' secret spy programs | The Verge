{"Main text":"Exhibit overwhelms viewers with the scale of governments' secret spy programs\nMore than 4,000 government code names on display\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt an art gallery in New York,  Citizenfour cinematographer Trevor Paglen is showing a video installation that features more than 4,000 surveillance program code names from both the National Security Agency (NSA) and Government Communications Headquarters. Entitled Code Names of the Surveillance State, the exhibition consists of endlessly scrolling columns projected on the four walls of Metro Pictures' Chelsea gallery, and will run until December 20th.\nThe code names displayed are described as \"deliberately nonsensical\" and without any ostensible connection to the programs they represent. For example, Bacon Ridge refers to an NSA facility in Texas while Mystic is reportedly a program for accruing every phone call from the Bahamas. A version of the installation was on display in the United Kingdom from October 31st to November 7th. Paglen is one of many artists who have produced interstitial pieces revolving around the NSA,  including Oliver Bienkowski who projected a comical image of President Obama and the words \"NSA in da House\" on the walls of the US Embassy in Berlin.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
