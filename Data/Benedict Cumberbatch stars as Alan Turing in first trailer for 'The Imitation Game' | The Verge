{"Main text":"Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing in first trailer for 'The Imitation Game'\nA dramatic look at Turing's World War II code breaking\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAlan Turing's work as a British codebreaker is often said to have shortened the course of World War II, and that work is now becoming the subject of the film The Imitation Game. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing, the movie focuses on the computer science pioneer's work on cracking the German Enigma Code, while also touching on Turing's struggle with being a gay man in England at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. A  first trailer for The Imitation Game premiered this morning, and it makes the film appear to be a grand and dramatic look at the war from an angle less-often covered.
