{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn classic LG fashion, the upcoming flagship G4 smartphone is being gradually revealed in a trickle of small announcements detailing its new features and specs. Earlier this week, we found out that the G4 will be among the leaders in terms of camera aperture, besting Samsung by the thinnest of margins with an f\/1.8 lens . Today, LG Innotek, the component-making arm of the LG conglomerate, is announcing that it's started mass production of the G4's camera module, which marries up a new 16-megapixel sensor with that fast new lens. This is the first time LG has bumped up the resolution since 2013's excellent G2, and should mark a change in camera performance as well.\n80 percent more light, 23 percent more pixels than G3\nLG Innotek says that, thanks to its improved camera aperture, the new imaging module \"receives 80 percent more light\" than the one on the incumbent G3 flagship , which is probably what's allowed the company to grow more aggressive with a higher resolution number. The front-facing camera is also bumped up to 8 megapixels, underscoring the importance that phone manufacturers now attach to selfies. For now, numbers are all we have to go on, though it's evident that LG's putting an emphasis on imaging in its next smartphone. The LG G4's big launch is scheduled for April 28th , which is when we should get a better idea of how it stacks up against Samsung and the rest of the Android competition.\n","Title":"LG G4 camera gets a resolution bump to match Galaxy S6 | The Verge","Tags":["google","photography","mobile","tech"]}
