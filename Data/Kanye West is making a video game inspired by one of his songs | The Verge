West stopped by Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club yesterday to talk about his  Adidas fashion line , his upcoming album, and Kim Kardashian. Near the very end of the interview, he slyly mentioned that he's working on a video game based on his recent single, \" Only One .\"\nThere's \"only one\" Kanye\nThe hour-long interview contains some nice Kanye tidbits \u2014 he wants to work with Disney and called his new track \" Wolves \" a \" post-Drake \" song \u2014 but the most interesting moment was when West mentioned the video game, which will be imagined and designed by Yeezy himself. Its inspiration, \"Only One,\" imagines a conversation between West's daughter and his mother, who died in 2007.\nWest gave a vague description of the game, which he says he's been working on for six months. \"The idea is that it\u2019s my mother going through the gates of heaven,\" he said, \"and you\u2019ve got to bring her to the highest gate of heaven by holding her to the light.\"\nThere's no official release date for the game, and it's unclear how close it is to completion. So for now you'll have to content yourself with 2013's  Kanye Quest 3030 . The Power 105.1 video game talk starts around the 56-minute mark, above.\n","Title":"Kanye West is making a video game inspired by one of his songs | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
