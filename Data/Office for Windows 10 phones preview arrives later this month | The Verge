{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is planning to preview its updated Office suite for Windows 10 phones by the end of the month. While the company has already launched a preview of the universal apps for desktop PCs and tablets, the phone-optimized version will provide a closer look at how Microsoft\u2019s Office apps will work across Windows, iOS, and Android. Microsoft launched free versions of Office for iOS and Android last year, leaving Windows Phone users with an outdated interface and a lack of features compared to rival platforms.\nThe Office for Windows 10 phones preview will correct that, bringing a fresh new interface and the same features found on the new iOS and Android versions. Microsoft has really optimized the interface for thumb use, with most of the commonly used editing controls available at the bottom of the screen. While Microsoft is currently previewing a version of the Windows 10 operating system for phones, it\u2019s in the early stages of development with lots of UI and app changes planned to accommodate small screens. The new Office universal apps aren\u2019t built directly into Windows 10, but they will ship with new phones later this year, and the switch to store apps means Microsoft can update Word, Excel, and PowerPoint more frequently. This should result in an update schedule that\u2019s similar to the iOS and Android versions, with at least one update per month for bug fixes or minor feature additions.\n","Title":"Office for Windows 10 phones preview arrives later this month | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
