In fact, you have until 12:35PM on Sunday. That's the absolute latest time you can start watching BSG to stream the entire show. Assuming you don't sleep or take any breaks.\nWhy take up the task? Ronald D. Moore's Battlestar Galactica, a reboot of the 1978-1980 show, began as a two-part miniseries on SyFy (then: Sci Fi Channel) before its four-season run through 2009. It's best to go in knowing as little as possible, but if you need convincing, here's a  list of awards it has won , including two Peabody Awards.\nThis could be you:\nOkay. Let's do the math.\nWith some exceptions, every episode is just under 44 minutes. We rounded up to the nearest minute, just to be safe \/ account for whatever load time you might have in between episodes.\nSeason one: a two-part, 185-minute miniseries, two 45-minute episodes, and 11 more at 44 minutes = 759 minutes (12 hours, 39 minutes)\nSeason two: a 68-minute finale, 1x 46min, 1x45min, 17x 44min = 907 minutes (15 hours, 7 minutes)\nSeason three: an 88-minute premiere, 1x 43min, 2x 45min, 1x 48min, 14x 44 = 885 minutes (14 hours, 45 minutes)\nSeason four: an 87-minutes \"Razor\" miniseries (which you can skip if need be), 1x 47min, 20x 44 = 1,014 minutes (16 hours, 54 minutes)\nGrand total: 3,565 minutes with \"Razor,\" 3,478 minutes without \u2014 just shy of 60 hours.\nI know what you're thinking. It's unhealthy to forego sleep for two-and-a-half days. Google tells me (via  Scientific American ) that, anecdotally, unmedicated patients with mania and soldiers in battle can go without sleep for three to four days. So you might be fine. Maybe.\nBut if you need time away \u2014 say,  seven hours of sleep and one hour of miscellaneous breaks \u2014 then you'll probably need to take Monday and \/ or Tuesday off to finish in time.\nThe alternative would be to pick up a DVD \/ Blu-ray collection or pay for seasons à la carte, but that'll set you back anywhere from $100 to $300. So I think you know what to do.\nGood luck.\nSo say we all.\n","Title":"'Battlestar Galactica' is leaving Netflix.
