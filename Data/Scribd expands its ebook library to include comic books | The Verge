The ebook subscription service just announced it has  acquired more than 10,000 comic books and graphic novels, bringing its total title count to the 1 million mark. Under Scribd's $8.99 per month subscription, users will get access to classic runs of comics like The Avengers and X-Men, plus titles like Alan Moore\u2019s The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\nScribd has partnered with more than 10 comic book publishers, including Marvel, Archie, IDW, and Arcana. It's the first ebook subscription service to lock down a comic book partnership of this size.\nOne million titles\nUsers will be able to search by title, publisher, and character, and Scribd's author profile pages will live alongside character profile pages that contain trivia about comic book heroes like Spider-Man and G.I. Joe. The app will also feature a \"binge button\" at the end of each comic book, which will allow users to jump immediately to the next title in a series.\nThis is Scribd's most recent move to expand its library. Last month, the service and its competitor Oyster both  partnered with the publishing giant Macmillan , adding more than 1,000 books each to their libraries. Both services have also previously inked deals with HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster. In November of last year, Scribd  expanded its library to include audiobooks , something Oyster has yet to do.\nMarvel VP Daniele Campbell said that with the partnership, they hope to reach readers \"who wouldn't normally find themselves inside a comic shop.\" And now, with a Scribd subscription, they won't have to.\n","Title":"Scribd expands its ebook library to include comic books | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
