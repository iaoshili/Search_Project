{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDespite having recently received a dose of the experimental anti-ebola drug ZMapp, a Liberian doctor died on Sunday, reports Front Page Africa and the  BBC . Abraham Borbor was an internist and one of three African physicians who were injected with ZMapp in mid-August. The news casts a shadow over last week\u2019s announcement that the two Americans who have been treated with the drug on US soil were released from the hospital last week.\n\"He was a classmate in high school, so this hits close to home.\"\nIn reaction to Borbor\u2019s death, the Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown told Front Page Africa that Borbor \"was walking around yesterday and the doctors were hopeful that he would make a full recovery,\" adding also that \"he was a classmate in high school, so this hits close to home.\"\nAbout 55 percent Ebola cases recorded in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone since March have resulted in death. The extent of the outbreak has been called \"unprecedented\" by the World Health Organization, and although there\u2019s some hope that ZMapp might help treat those infected with Ebola, the drug has never been tested on humans, so scientists still don\u2019t know if it actually works. Moreover, quantities of the drug are extremely limited. According to the CDC, over 2,400 people have been infected with Ebola since this winter.\n","Title":"An African doctor who received the experimental anti-Ebola drug ZMapp has died | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world"]}
