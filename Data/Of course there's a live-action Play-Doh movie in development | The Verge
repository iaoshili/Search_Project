Sadly, we should have seen this coming.\nGhostbusters director Paul Feig is reportedly in talks to direct the film, and will likely be the film's dominant creative voice. The hope is that Feig, along with screenwriter Jason Micallef, can produce a film of a similar quality as last year's The Lego Movie, which earned universal acclaim and an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. But let's put things in perspective here. The Lego Movie was a cashgrab that managed to surprise audiences by being  genuinely excellent , and had the benefit of Lego's already having a massive fictive universe to draw inspiration from. The Play-Doh film is also a cashgrab that's transparently trying to mirror Lego's success, but without having a well to draw from. It can be good, sure. Plenty of people love Play-Doh. But how much story could a movie about modeling gunk really tell?\nHow much story could a movie about modeling gunk really tell\nAlso, keep this in mind: Hasbro Films, already a force to be reckoned with when it comes to branded movie efforts, hasn't produced a single critically successful movie to date. Not one. Not Battleship. Not the G.I. Joe series. Certainly not Ouija. The Transformers franchise is the kind of money-making behemoth that now deserves  a Marvel-esque film universe of its own , but no one should ever say they're good movies. In many ways, this movie was inevitable. That, in and of itself, is a bad sign.\n","Title":"Of course there's a live-action Play-Doh movie in development | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
