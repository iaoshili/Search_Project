{"Main text":"The Legend of Zelda finally got the Game of Thrones intro treatment it deserves\nWesteros < Hyrule. Sorry, Westeros.\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGame of Thrones Season 5 begins this Sunday, and one assumes that you're looking for reasons to get excited. One further assumes that you were saddened to hear that the  Legend of Zelda is not, in fact, coming to Netflix as a live-action show. As long as one is assuming, one also can't help but think that the  delay of the Legend of Zelda on the Wii U beyond 2015 has broken your already fragile, adventure-loving heart.\nBut I invite you to fill that hole in your still-beating, broken heart with the YouTube video above. It was crafted by  Megasteakman for YouTube, and it's a pitch-perfect recreation of the Game of Thrones intro sequence, but set in Hyrule to Zelda's classic theme music. In it, the 2D world of A Link to the Past rises out into 3D space in exactly the way you'd expect. It's really pretty good!\nJust watch it, okay? Because it's as close to a Zelda TV show as you're going to get. And given  what we got the last time Nintendo let that happen , maybe that's for the best.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
