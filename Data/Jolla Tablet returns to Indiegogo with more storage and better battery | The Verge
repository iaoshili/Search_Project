{"Main text":"Jolla Tablet returns to Indiegogo with more storage and better battery\nThe 7.9-inch device was originally fully-funded in December 2014\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFinnish tech company Jolla has  re-opened funding for its first ever tablet on Indiegogo with an improved 64GB device. Customers who backed  the original 7.9-inch Jolla Tablet before December 11th can upgrade to the new model for $25, or new customers can buy it outright for $249.\nSupport for microsd cards up to 128GB \u2014 but not on windows devices\nAs well as improved storage, the updated tablet has been given a slight battery bump (4300mAh to 4450mAh), a fully laminated display, gyroscope and compass sensors. The new tablet also offers support for microSD cards up to 128GB in size, but that comes with a catch. \"Due to Microsoft\u2019s licensing limitations,\" says Jolla, \"cards over 32GB that are formatted in Jolla Tablet will not be readable with Windows computers or devices that advertise microSDXC support (cameras\/phones\/tablets).\" This is because Jolla hasn't licensed  Microsoft exFAT for its Sailfish OS .\nThe  original crowdfunding campaign for the Jolla tablet reached its $380,000 target in just a couple of hours, and ended up raising more than $1.8 million in total \u2014 nearly five times its original goal. The tablet comes with a 2,048 x 1,536 resolution, 1.8GHz quad-core Intel processor, 2GB of RAM, and can run Android apps.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
