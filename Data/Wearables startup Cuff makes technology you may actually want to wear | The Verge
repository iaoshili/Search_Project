{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere\u2019s little doubt that most wearable technology currently focuses more on function than form \u2014 but that will have to change if the category has a hope of going truly mainstream. That\u2019s the mindset of a San Francisco-based startup called Cuff, which has just announced a new line of wearables (available to pre-order now) with a goal of making technology you\u2019ll actually want to wear and show off. Cuff\u2019s accessories are also different than the current wearables marketplace in another way \u2014 rather than focusing on fitness tracking or smartphone notifications, Cuff is positioning its product as a personal security system that lets you quickly reach a pre-designated circle of trusted contacts.\nThe whole system is based off the CuffLinc: a small black tracker that owners can move between any of the nine different fashion accessories the company is bringing to market. Using the accompanying iOS app, you can set up your CuffLinc and find other friends and family using the product to build your network. \"Imagine a mom puts [a CuffLinc] on her teenage daughter and also puts it on her aging mother,\" explains Cuff founder Deepa Sood, a former VP of product at Restoration Hardware. \"When you press it, they get a sort of smart propagation depending on who's closest in your social network and who's closest geographically. And then the receiver, if they're wearing a cuff, their cuff will vibrate.\"\n\"Our first function is security.\"\nFrom there, you can open the Cuff app and find out exactly where the person who sent the alert is, thanks to the built-in GPS chip. \"If they're not wearing a cuff, which many men won't be wearing a cuff, the alert goes right to their phone, and that gives you geographic information,\" says Sood. \"The idea is that you buy a couple different pieces and you move the CuffLinc around,\" she says, \"and you buy it for your loved ones to protect them, because our first function is security.\"\nThere\u2019s some flexibility here, as well \u2014 the iOS app (the company hopes to launch on Android as well) will let you get more granular with the CuffLinc\u2019s alert system. By double-clicking the CuffLinc, for example, you could send a notification directly to your spouse without alerting the rest of your network. You can customize the vibration pattern, as well, so the recipient will know it\u2019s not a real emergency. \"S.O.S. is the primary function, but even in the first roll out it's not just for emergencies,\" says Sood. \"If I\u2019m wearing the Cuff, I can program it so my husband and my babysitter can always get through to me even if my phone's not on me \u2014 it'll vibrate and them I know I have to step out and reach them.\"\nIt\u2019s a bit of an esoteric and new use case for wearable technology, but Cuff is already thinking about more features it can add down the line. As the CuffLinc is connected to your phone with Bluetooth, the team envisions using it as a remote to trigger different features, like skipping songs or taking a photo. \"Very soon we\u2019ll be peeling off behavior from your phone,\" says Sood. \"We\u2019ve talked about taking a picture, or making your phone ring to get out of a bad date. People really liked that one.\"\nNew features will be enabled via a software update, and different click patterns can be assigned to trigger your phone. And you won\u2019t have to worry about charging \u2014 the CuffLinc\u2019s non-replaceable battery should power it for a year, at which point you\u2019ll receive a notification that you\u2019ll unfortunately need to purchase a new one.\nWearable tech with style \u2014 but you'll have to wait for it\nPerhaps more important than the technology behind Cuff is the company\u2019s fashion-first sensibility: if people don\u2019t actively want to wear the company\u2019s products, they\u2019ll never catch on. To that end, Cuff will offer nine different items, ranging from a simple keychain to more attention grabbing leather and metal bracelets, necklaces, and pendants \u2014 each of which comes with a CuffLinc that can be embedded invisibly inside the piece of jewelry. The metal pieces come in either silver or gold plating, while the leather pieces also come in two different color options.\nWhile Cuff may be clearly targeting a feminine market with these first pieces and the style is, as always, a matter of personal taste, there\u2019s little doubt these are some of the most stylish wearables we\u2019ve seen on the market. And Sood has greater ambition for the Cuff line than just this first set of jewelry the company is launching \u2014 she wants other makers to start producing CuffLinc compatible pieces, building out an ever-expanding collection. If this first set doesn\u2019t work with your style, there may be something down the line that does.\n","Title":"Wearables startup Cuff makes technology you may actually want to wear | The Verge","Tags":["design","tech"]}
