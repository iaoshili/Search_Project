{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 preview program is starting to  supply updates on a regular basis , the leakers are always one step ahead. A new Windows 10 build (10051) has surfaced on the internet today that includes some welcome changes. The most obvious additions are new Mail and Calendar apps that look and feel a lot like Microsoft\u2019s Office Windows 10 apps. Microsoft previously demonstrated an early copy of the apps at its Windows 10 event in January, but it\u2019s clear the company is ready to test them more broadly, and I would expect to see them in an official preview release in the coming weeks.\nThe Mail and Calendar apps are fairly basic right now, but they\u2019re also very functional and incredibly fast and smooth to use. They both feel and look a lot better than their existing counterparts in Windows 8.1. Microsoft is borrowing new swipe actions from its  Outlook for iOS \/ Android client , and if you have a Windows 10 touch machine then you\u2019ll be able to swipe right on mail to set a flag or swipe left to delete messages. These swipe actions are customizable, just like the mobile version of Outlook. There\u2019s support for multiple accounts, and easy ways to add Google or Exchange accounts. Microsoft has also built support for a custom image in the right pane of the Mail app. It\u2019s designed to remove the white space, and it will disappear when you select a mail. This new Mail app is still labelled Mail, but Microsoft is planning to brand it as Outlook in future.\n","Title":"New Windows 10 Mail and Calendar apps appear in leaked build | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","hands--on","tech"]}
