{"Main text":"The FDA has a running Flickr photo gallery of recalled products\nWhat's worse than a suppository? One that's been recalled by the FDA\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou can find a Flickr account for just about anything, from boudoir photoshoots, to lavish sneaker collections. And as it turns out, there's also a gallery run by the US Food and Drug Administration that  posts nothing but photos of things that might kill you . Spotted by  Popular Science , the account catalogs a portion of (but not all) products that have been recalled by the FDA. That runs the gamut from waffles to male performance enhancement drugs, all of which you can see in photo form. Each shot also comes with information of when the recall was issued, and a link to the FDA's release.\nThe account is, by no means, a substitution for  proper recall reports from the FDA , which are issued as soon as safety problems are made public. Those recalls and safety alerts also often come with photos, making this more of an unusual way to explore the world of dangerous products. The FDA kept  a similar album going last year, which posted 830 photos of recalled products.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
