{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDavid Guttenfelder returned to the US last month after spending the previous 20 years working as a photojournalist overseas. His career with the Associated Press had taken him to far flung places across the globe \u2014 Nairobi, Tokyo, North Korea \u2014 so his return should have marked a homecoming for the Iowa native. But it didn\u2019t quite feel like that.\n\u201CThe United States kind of feels like a foreign country to me,\u201D Guttenfelder says. \u201CI\u2019ve never worked here as a photographer before. I\u2019ve never had to walk up to Americans to put a camera in their face.\u201D\nYet that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s been doing since he got back. Upon his arrival, Guttenfelder launched @everydayusa , an Instagram account where he and 12 other documentary photographers publish shots of contemporary life across the US. Some are pointed in their social commentary \u2014 a Muslim high school student standing at her locker, a black man raising his hands in Ferguson \u2014 others are less so \u2014 a black-and-white Beach Party Barbie doll , a man and his daughter dressed in matching pink outfits in a Connecticut parking lot. Each carries the distinct aesthetic of its author, but when combined into one feed, they form a powerful collage that blurs the line between the quotidian and the profound.\nImage credits: Alec Soth \/ Malin Fezehai .\nThe project was inspired by photographer Peter DiCampo\u2019s feed @everydayafrica , which aimed to dispel media-fueled stereotypes and misconceptions about Africa with images of everyday life. The feed spawnedÂ  @everydayasia and other spinoffs after it launched in 2012, but Guttenfelder says @everydayusa is decidedly different in scope. The aim isn\u2019t to challenge commonly held stereotypes about the US, but to shed light on social issues that members of the collective are passionate about.\n\"We have sort of the opposite problem here, which is that there are a lot of serious issues, social justice and things that documentary photographers traditionally cover but don\u2019t have a place to publish daily,\" he says. \"So this is a place for us to tackle hidden things and important issues without the constraints of having to do it for a client.\"\nfrom north korea to north carolina\nGuttenfelder has garnered a large following on his personal Instagram feed, where he regularly published fascinating photos from isolated North Korea. He created the @everydayusa account last year in Pyongyang, where he was working as the AP\u2019s chief photographer for Asia, but didn\u2019t launch the project until he left his job and returned to the states this summer. (He\u2019s now working on projects across the US as a National Geographic Society Fellow.)\nThe collective began with a small group of Guttenfelder\u2019s friends, before expanding to 13 over the past several weeks. \"I was really just looking to collaborate with photographers who were like-minded photographers,\" he says. \"People who were serious documentary photographers who were using Instagram in new ways as part of their work, which is what I was trying to do.\"\nThey hail from diverse backgrounds, as well. Brooklyn-based Ruddy Roye documents the people he encounters on the streets of New York, while Danny Wilcox Frazier has focused on economic transformations in Iowa and other rural areas. Not all were Instagram aficionados, either. Relative newcomer Jon Lowenstein documents life on the South Side of Chicago, and has turned his Instagram feed into what Guttenfelder describes as a \"community newspaper\" for the area.\n\"It's very much about taking people along with you.\"\nThere isn\u2019t any clear editorial mandate or curation behind @everydayusa. Each photographer has access to the account and can publish at will. The only guidelines are to share the space equally and, as Guttenfelder says, to \"stick to the spirit of what we think Instagram is for.\"\n\"It\u2019s not a place to be using your DSLR cameras,\" he explains. \"It\u2019s not a place to be republishing your portfolio or other assignments, watermarking your pictures. It\u2019s very much about taking people along with you on either your day to day or on projects that you\u2019re working on.\"\nGuttenfelder doesn\u2019t plan to expand the collective anytime soon, though says they\u2019ll begin honing their focus and \"start tackling issues as a group.\" They may eventually begin working with magazines or other clients, but for now they\u2019re just following their instincts as photojournalists, as Guttenfelder reacquaints himself with a home that still doesn\u2019t feel like home.\n\"I\u2019m just using photography the way I would anywhere else in the world \u2014 to learn about the world around me,\" he says. \"And America still feels foreign to me, which is great.\"\n","Title":"Unfiltered America: one Instagram account is documenting the Everyday USA | The Verge","Tags":["photography","culture","report","us-world"]}
