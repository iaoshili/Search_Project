{"Main text":"Lenovo made a Selfie Flash and it is awesome\nThe Vibe Xtension Selfie Flash will sell for $29 on Lenovo's website\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere are many things you can find at CES that are pointless and a complete waste of time. But there are also things you come across that sound ridiculous, and yet turn out to be insanely fun. The Lenovo Vibe Xtension Selfie Flash is one of those things, and it does exactly what you think it does. This may be the most fun you can have for $29.\nThe Selfie Flash is meant to remedy an issue that has plagued selfie takers since the dawn of the smartphone with a front-facing camera \u2014 bad lighting. The Selfie Flash contains eight diffused LEDs in a round metal casing with a single button on the back that allows you to take your selfie. Lenovo says it works with any Android device by simply plugging it into the headphone jack \u2014 we tested it with a Moto X, and it worked flawlessly, but didn't want to work on our Nexus 5 or our iPhone 6 Plus.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nThe Selfie Flash doesn't actually flash, instead emitting a steady light when you press the button. That's a good thing \u2014 it allows you balance out your shot instead of surprising you with a bright flash. You can also turn the Selfie Flash around and use it as a flash for your rear camera, a much better option than the flash on most smartphones.\nLenovo tells us the Selfie Flash will last you 100 selfies on a single charge. The company states that it won't be sold in the US, but will be made available on its website when it is released in the spring. The selfie game has officially been changed.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Lenovo made a Selfie Flash and it is awesome | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
