While ovens let you set an exact heat, cooking on a burner requires lots of adjustments as you try to find that sweet spot for simmering a stew or poaching an egg. Now, one company says it has the solution: a smart knob that fits easily onto your current gas or electric range, automatically monitoring and adjusting the temperature via an app on your smartphone.\nmeld has three components: knob, thermometer, and app\nThis is the Meld, a new addition to the connected home that  launched on Kickstarter earlier this week and is already on its way to doubling its funding goal of $50,000. The product itself is actually made up of three components: the knob, which mechanically controls the temperature on the burner with a battery-powered motor; a thermometer, which clips into your pots and pans to measure the temperature, sending data back wirelessly to the knob; and a connected iOS and Android app, which allows you to remotely control the temperature or choose from hundreds of preset recipes.\nThe Meld app and smart knob. ( Meld )\nMeld's creators say the device can be used for a whole range of cooking methods, including poaching, frying, simmering, slow cooking, and candy making. The precise temperature control also means it's suitable for sous vide \u2014 a method which involves sealing meat in a plastic bag and placing it in a water bath for long periods of time. Sous vide has been a target for smart cooking companies for a while now, with products like  the $179 Anova allowing amateur chefs to set and forget their submersed steaks.\nHowever, the Meld is not only cheaper than other options on the market (Kickstarter early birds snagged it for $99, but its normal retail price is $149), but it's also more flexible, allowing users to automate a greater number of recipes. Some people might complain that using tech like this isn't the same as actually becoming a better chef \u2014 after all, it's the app that's doing the cooking \u2014 but at least your food will taste better, and in the kitchen, that's what counts.\n","Title":"The Meld smart knob takes over your stove to do the cooking | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
