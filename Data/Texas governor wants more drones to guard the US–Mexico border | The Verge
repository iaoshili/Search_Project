At an event in New Hampshire today \u2014 the home of killed journalist James Foley \u2014 Perry said that there could be members of ISIS who have made it in to the US. \"We don\u2019t know,\" Perry says. \"They may have used our southern border, because it\u2019s porous.\"\n\"The border is not secure.\"\nTo prevent something like that from happening \u2014 or, at the very least, to crack down on issues of undocumented immigration \u2014 Perry reportedly said that the US needs more troops and military-style drones guarding the border. US Customs and Border Protection has been using drones along the border for close to a decade now, but Bloomberg reports that Perry still sees it as far too open. \"The border is not secure,\" he says. Obama has been  ramping up detentions and deportations in response to Republican concerns over border security as well.\nPerry is reported to be considering a presidential campaign in 2016, and he's currently on a tour that's thought to be in support of that. Statements like this one today about drones might help with his base, but Perry may have some larger issues to contend with. He was recently indicted on two felony counts for abuse of power, though he intends to fight the charges and believes he will be successful.\n","Title":"Texas governor wants more drones to guard the US\u2013Mexico border | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","national-security"]}
