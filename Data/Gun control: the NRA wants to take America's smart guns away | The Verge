{"Main text":"1449 Comments\nOn a recent Thursday night, Maryland gun store owner Andy Raymond set up a video camera in front of a wall of rifles and sat down with a bottle of whiskey and a cigarette. He rested his tattooed arms on the glass counter, which contained more guns, and leaned toward the camera. It was time to undo the mess he\u2019d made. \u201CI\u2019m Andy from Engage Armament,\u201D he said, tapping his cigarette into a shot glass. \u201CThere\u2019s been a lot of drama today here.\u201D\nThe drama was over the Armatix iP1 , a compact, .22 caliber, 10-round pistol made in Germany. The iP1 is a \u201Csmart\u201D gun, meaning it only fires in the hands of its owner. Or rather, it only fires if it\u2019s within 10 inches of its companion iW1 watch, which is presumably on the owner\u2019s wrist. It can also be disabled with a timer or a PIN code.\nEngage Armament announced it would start carrying the iP1 on May 1st. It backpedaled less than 24 hours later, after gun-rights advocates lashed out on Facebook and called the store, threatening to shoot Raymond, his girlfriend, and his dog.\nThere has been renewed interest in smart guns since the Newtown school shooting, which reinvigorated the gun-control debate. However, there is immense pressure not to be the first to sell them. That\u2019s because of a New Jersey law passed in 2002 known as the Childproof Handgun Law, which says that all guns sold in New Jersey must be state-approved smart guns within three years of a smart gun being sold anywhere in the country. The goal was to make smart guns mandatory as soon as the technology existed. Officially, no smart gun has been sold in the US yet \u2014 meaning if Raymond had sold one, it would have triggered the clause in New Jersey.\n\"My apologies to the people of New Jersey,\" Raymond said in the video, which was posted to Facebook but has since been deleted. \"I did not know that I would be screwing you over.\"\nSmart guns, or personalized guns, are designed to be useless unless unlocked by radio signal or a biometric authenticator such as voice activation, fingerprints, or a retina scan. When New Jersey\u2019s law was written, proponents thought smart guns were just around the corner. They were supposed to be here over a decade ago, but politics keeps getting in the way.\n\"We thought it would take, I don\u2019t know, three or four years for some American manufacturer to get the nerve up to do what is really not rocket science,\" says Bryan Miller, a gun-control advocate who led the charge for the 2002 law.  \"The reason it hasn\u2019t happened is very simply because the gun industry and its lobby have intimidated American companies from doing it.\"\nThe CEO of Colt wrote an editorial supporting smart guns in 1997; he was ousted the next year. Smith & Wesson started building one in 1999 as part of a government order; the National Rifle Association immediately organized a Smith & Wesson boycott. Last month, Oak Tree Gun Club in California briefly carried the iP1, but a fierce backlash prompted a swift retreat before any were sold. The store now denies it ever stocked the gun , even though photos show otherwise.\n\"We want gun owners to feel like they are dinosaurs if they aren\u2019t using smart guns.\"\nSmart-gun advocates say the technology will stop kids from shooting themselves with their parents\u2019 guns, undermine the market for stolen guns, and protect law enforcement from having their guns used against them. \"We need the iPhone of guns,\" said Ron Conway, a Silicon Valley investor, referring to the phone\u2019s fingerprint unlock. Conway is backing a $1 million contest for smart-gun technology. \"We want gun owners to feel like they are dinosaurs if they aren\u2019t using smart guns,\" he told the Washington Post.\nOpponents counter that the technology adds an unnecessary failure point \u2014 you don\u2019t want to fumble with a fingerprint unlock if someone is breaking into your home. They also fear the spread of laws like New Jersey\u2019s, since similar proposals have been introduced in other states and in Congress. \"The NRA does not oppose new technological developments in firearms,\" the group writes on its website . \"We are opposed to government mandates that require the use of expensive, unreliable features, such as grips that would read your fingerprints before the gun will fire.\"\nCriticism also comes from a surprising place: The Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy group, which has a long list of objections to smart guns . \"There is this idea that the smart gun is a catch-all solution,\" says director Josh Sugarman, but people use their own guns in murders and suicides most of the time anyway. \"Even if every gun was a smart gun, it would affect a very small percentage of gun violence in this country.\"\nThe focus on smart guns cannibalizes funding and attention that should be put toward gun-violence research and the fight to stop military-grade weapons from being sold to civilians, Sugarman says. And while smart guns tend to grab headlines, there is little evidence that people actually want them.\nStill, smart-gun development continues. After the Newtown shooting, the White House issued a call for gun-safety technologies , including smart-gun systems, for which the Justice Department will soon award $2 million in grants. In Silicon Valley, the $1 million Smart Tech for Firearms Challenge has received more than 200 entries. There are products already on the market , including two fingerprint-unlocking accessories and the iGun, a rifle that uses a system similar to the iP1 but unlocks with a ring instead of a watch.\nPerhaps the longest-running smart-gun technology is being developed by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). NJIT has been working on a \"Dynamic Grip Recognition\" system, which uses 32 sensors to measure pressure in a user\u2019s unique grip, since the state passed its smart-gun law. The research group is now seeking private investment for a prototype gun.\n\"We have found overwhelming consumer acceptance for the idea,\" says Donald Sebastian, NJIT\u2019s vice president of research and development. \"What people say in a poll may not translate to what actually happens in the marketplace.\"\nThe fact that there are some products commercially available may be enough to trigger New Jersey\u2019s law even if no smart guns have been sold. Acting attorney general John Hoffman also has the authority to certify that the technology is ready. \"We anticipate, in the near future, initiating a firearm testing and evaluation procedure to determine whether the Armatix iP1 handgun meets these statutory criteria,\" he wrote in a March 4th letter to State Senator Loretta Weinberg.\nSenator Weinberg was a leading proponent of the 2002 law, which took six years to pass. She\u2019s ready to toss it out, however, now that it\u2019s being used to stop smart guns from being sold anywhere. If the NRA will drop its resistance to smart guns, she says she will introduce a bill to repeal the law .\nIt seems inevitable that some store is going to start carrying smart guns soon, regardless of what happens in Jersey. \"Intimidation can\u2019t last forever,\" says Miller, the former Ceasefire NJ director who now leads the gun-control group Heeding God\u2019s Call.\nSmart guns still seem inevitable, no matter what happens in New Jersey\nMany gun owners don\u2019t object to smart guns, as long as they\u2019re still allowed to buy regular guns. \"If someone wants to buy a smart gun, that is fine,\" Raymond said in his Facebook address. \"When the law legislates it, that is a sin.\" After the apology, he and his shop were flooded with supportive emails, calls, and visits. Members of the Maryland Shooters forum even rallied for a barbecue at Engage Armament . \"It is only a matter of time before such guns are available. Acting like babies about it doesn't make things better,\" one user wrote . \"Assuming of course there is an actual market for such a bad idea.\"\n","Title":"Gun control: the NRA wants to take America's smart guns away | The Verge","Tags":["policy","report","us-world"]}
