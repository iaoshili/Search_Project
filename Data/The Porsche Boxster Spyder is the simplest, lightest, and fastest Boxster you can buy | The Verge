{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPorsche has always been reticent to tread on the performance stats of its legendary (and more expensive) 911 with the Boxster and Cayman, but it happens here and there. Take today's launch of the Boxster Spyder, for instance: it's a stripped-down, juiced-up version of the popular little ragtop that focuses on lightness to keep the car quick. Indeed, it has both more horsepower and a better 0-60 time than a base Carrera.\nAnd truly, \"stripped down\" is an understatement: the Spyder forgoes a radio and air conditioner as standard equipment \u2014 Porsche notes that the engine is your music and the outside air is your AC \u2014 but you can option them at no additional charge, if you're hellbent on making the car heavier for the sake of your own comfort. Keeping with the theme, a true manual is the only transmission being offered.\nOn the outside, changes are subtle but noticeable: a pair of humps on the rear deck look cool and help with the wind profile, and a manually operated soft top that folds neatly underneath \u2014 as long as you're willing to get out of the car to do it. On the back, the \"Boxster\" logo is replaced with just \"Spyder,\" which helps your Boxster-owning neighbors understand that you own a very special model indeed.\nThe new model won't be easy to get: it'll be a limited run, starting at $82,100. That's $30,000 more than a base Boxster.\nCorrection: In the video, I mention that the Spyder has an inline six-cylinder engine. This is obviously not correct \u2014 the Spyder, like all Boxsters, has a flat six.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"The Porsche Boxster Spyder is the simplest, lightest, and fastest Boxster you can buy | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","transportation"]}
