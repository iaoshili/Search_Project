{"Main text":"Canada just joined Twitter, eh\n@Canada will definitely ask people to RT, please\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCanada joined Twitter today, and it did it in the best way possible. Whoever's running the official  @Canada account could have said \"sorry\" for being late to the party, but instead the country that spawned Mike Myers, Dan Aykroyd, and Ryan Reynolds played to its strengths and decided to laugh at itself.\n. @Canada 's now on Twitter, eh! pic.twitter.com\/OQAAYohuwL\n\u2014 Au Canada (@AuCanada) November 26, 2014\nOfficial country Twitter accounts usually differ from governmental accounts. They're largely used to promote tourism, and tend to avoid politics altogether. In fact, very few countries have official Twitter accounts, so it looks like Canada has just joined the exclusive ranks of countries such as  @GreatBritain ,  @Israel ,  @SouthAfrica , and  @Sweden \u2014 the last of which started handing the account over to a different Swedish citizen  every week in 2011, with  mixed results .\nCanada has only published three tweets so far, so it's hard to tell what direction the account will take. But from what we can tell, it looks like the Canadian account won't stick to self-deprecating jokes for long. Already, @Canada has tweeted about how the account will serve as a \"shop window for everything that makes Canada the best country in the world.\" Still, that first tweet was both endearing and social media savvy, so we're willing to let this one slide. Welcome to Twitter, Canada.\nUpdate November 26th, 2:21PM: Canada subtweeted us.\n. @Canada does not apologize for this new Twitter account. #sorrynotsorry\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
