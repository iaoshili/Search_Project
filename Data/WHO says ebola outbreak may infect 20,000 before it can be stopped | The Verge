{"Main text":"WHO says ebola outbreak may infect 20,000 before it can be stopped\nStopping the disease in West Africa will cost $490 million\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe World Health Organization says a total of more than 20,000 people may be infected with ebola in West Africa before the virus is contained. The United Nations agency released a new roadmap for dealing with  the outbreak today, designed to respond to the \"urgent need to dramatically scale up the international response\" to the  rapid proliferation of the disease. The document says the ebola virus is spreading much faster than the WHO had anticipated, and would cost at least $490 million to control.\nThis outbreak has killed more than 1,550 people\nThat figure has increased from the $430 million specified in a draft of the road map  seen by Bloomberg News earlier this week . The cost has risen partly because the rate of infection is increasing: the WHO says more than 40 percent of ebola infections in West Africa occurred in the last 21 days, and in some places, the number of infected people  may be two to four times higher than reported . The WHO is attempting to halt the spread of the disease in six to nine months, but it has been criticized by humanitarian NGO Doctors Without Borders for lacking leadership and for being too slow to respond to the crisis.\nEbola has already killed more than 1,550 people in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea  and most recently, Nigeria . The WHO has declared the outbreak \u2014 which has infected more than 3,000 so far \u2014  a global health emergency . Pharmaceutical companies are fast-tracking  experimental ebola treatments in response to the crisis, but for now, the virus has no specific cure. Finding a treatment for ebola before it infects tens of thousands may be difficult, as  scientists reported yesterday that the disease has mutated repeatedly during its most deadly outbreak in history.\n","Title":"WHO says ebola outbreak may infect 20,000 before it can be stopped | The Verge","Tags":["us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
