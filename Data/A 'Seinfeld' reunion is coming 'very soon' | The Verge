{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Seinfeld cast is getting back together (again). After Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander were recently spotted walking into Tom's Restaurant \u2014 the New York City diner that played host to many of the sitcom's memorable scenes \u2014 fans were eager to know more about the encounter. When Seinfeld madeÂ  a guest appearance on Boomer & Carton Thursday morning, the hosts took full advantage of the opportunity and peppered the comedy star with questions. First, Seinfeld claimed that the reunion wasn't for a Super Bowl commercial, nor was it simply another episode of Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. \"But it is not not those things, either,\" he joked.\n@HuffingtonPost @BuzzFeed @Gothamist just saw Jerry and George walking in to Tom's Restaurant pic.twitter.com\/goN9o8zOqs\n\u2014 Ali Phil (@ClubAliP) January 13, 2014\n\"It's a secret project,\" Seinfeld said, confirming that other cast members were involved in filming. Co-creator Larry David also took part, though apparently in a production role \u2014 Seinfeld said he doesn't appear on camera. As for when fans can expect to see this \"shortish\" reunion, Seinfeld teased that it's coming \"very, very soon.\" This isn't the first time Seinfeld's stars have been reunited on camera; the seventh season of David's Curb Your Enthusiasm brought Seinfeld, Alexander, Michael Richards, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus together for a fictional Seinfeld reunion episode.\n","Title":"A 'Seinfeld' reunion is coming 'very soon' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
