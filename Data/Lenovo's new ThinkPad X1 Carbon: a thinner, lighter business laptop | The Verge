{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLenovo sells a lot of black boxes. At CES 2015, as it announced that it\u2019s sold 100 million ThinkPads, Lenovo also refreshed much of the lineup. The upgrades start with the X1 Carbon, which has been for a couple of years one of the best laptops on the market: the 14-inch laptop now comes with Intel\u2019s fifth-generation processors (the long-awaited Broadwell), plus faster solid-state drives and plenty of new business software. It still weighs less than three pounds, it still has that awesomely rugged body, and it has a brand-new high-res screen. The new model starts at $1,249.\nEven as it upgrades the technology inside, Lenovo took the X1 Carbon back to its roots. Gone are the clickable trackpad and the adaptive row of function buttons above the keyboard, replaced by the three buttons and the standard F1-F12 keys we\u2019ve seen for years. Evidently customers want their ThinkPads lighter, faster, and brighter, but they don\u2019t want them different. They want black boxes, and Lenovo is clearly happy to provide what its long-time, hardcore users demand.\nEverything about the X1 Carbon percolates down to the rest of the ThinkPad lineup, in slightly less impressive and slightly less expensive ways. They\u2019re all thinner, lighter, Broadwell-powered, and come with high-res dispays (as high as a 3K screen, if you buy the 15-inch T550). A couple have unique features like Intel\u2019s 3D RealSense camera, or discrete graphics. They\u2019re all full of software made for people who fly first class, use phrases like \u201Cthought leaders,\u201D and slam their fists on tables in board meetings. They\u2019re black boxes, the best ones Lenovo\u2019s ever made. But they\u2019re still ThinkPads through and through \u2013 as they have always been, and as they will ever be.\nThe new X1 Carbon is out this month, with the rest of the new ThinkPads to follow in February. Get ready to do some Very Serious Business this Q1.\n","Title":"Lenovo's new ThinkPad X1 Carbon: a thinner, lighter business laptop | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech","ces-2015"]}
