{"Main text":"'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2' is already slated for a June 3rd, 2016 release\nThat was fast\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter raking in a healthy $65 million this weekend, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is officially getting a sequel.  According to Deadline , the new movie is already in development and Michael Bay is back on board for a release on June 3rd, 2016.\nThe turtles did surprisingly well this weekend\nIt's important to note that TMNT would likely have received a sequel even if it were moderate box office success, given the strength of the property. However, the turtles did surprisingly well this weekend despite taking  a beating from most critics . It even beat Guardians of the Galaxy,  which took in a perfectly respectable $43 million in its second week in theaters.\nThere are currently no plot details and no word on if the entire cast will reprise their roles for the followup. Whether or not director Jonathan Liebsman will return is also unclear. But 2016 is still a ways away, so those details will arrive soon enough.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
