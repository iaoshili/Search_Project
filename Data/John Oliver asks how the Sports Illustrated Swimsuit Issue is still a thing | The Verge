{"Main text":"John Oliver asks how the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue is still a thing\nThe space between a Victoria's Secret mailer and an incognito Google search\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBetween SNL 40, the NBA All-Star game, and a three-hour episode of The Bachelor, it's possible you missed last night's episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. That's a shame, because season two is continuing the hot streak that began in season one.\nYou were too busy watching The Bachelor\nThe show's recurring segment, \"How Is This Still a Thing,\" tackled the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, the anachronistic compilation of sexy model photos that fall somewhere between Victoria's Secret and Playboy \u2014 themselves relics of a time long past.\nWho is the Swimsuit Issue for? My guess: teenage boys who can't purchase a smutty mag, but have some guilt complex about Googling \"nudes\" on their family's Dell.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
