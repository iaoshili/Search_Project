{"Main text":"Leonardo DiCaprio might play Steve Jobs in upcoming biopic\n'Slumdog Millionaire' director reportedly in talks to direct\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe director and lead actor of the  Aaron Sorkin-penned Steve Jobs biopic are still up in the air, and another pair of big names are now reportedly being eyed for the roles: Leonardo DiCaprio and Slumdog Millionaire-director Danny Boyle.  The Hollywood Reporter says that Sony Pictures is now in talks to sign Boyle, who has already approached DiCaprio about the possibility of starring as Jobs. The Social Network director David Fincher had  previously been in talks to direct with Christian Bale starring, but Sony is  reportedly replacing him over high pay requests .\nThe combination of Boyle and DiCaprio would also be likely to make the film appeal to a far broader audience than the pairing of Fincher and Bale might. Though Boyle and DiCaprio's history together \u2014 the 2000 film The Beach \u2014 was widely panned, there's no reason to suspect it'll happen again: much of Boyle's work has been widely acclaimed, with his film history including Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, and 127 Hours. This is still tentative news, however, so as with Fincher, we may not know the final names involved just yet.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
