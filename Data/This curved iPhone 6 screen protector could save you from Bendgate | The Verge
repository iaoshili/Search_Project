But what if you don\u2019t want a case? Well, a Korean company called Patchworks claims you can significantly enhance the durability of your phone by adding another layer of glass.\nPatchworks is now launching in the US after selling over 1.2 million screen protectors in Japan to become the market leader there, and its newest product is tailor-made to enhance the iPhone 6\u2019s durability. The ITG Edge protector melds a 0.4mm-thick, 11g sheet of \u201Cimpossible\u201D tempered glass with a bevel of liquid silicon to match the curves of the phone, and the company says it has been shown in stress testing to protect against deformation by nearly 45 percent.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nUnlike traditional film screen protectors, which can hinder the smooth feel of the phone\u2019s glass underneath, Patchworks\u2019 protectors are actually really pleasant to the touch \u2014 at least as nice as the actual phone. Most of the company\u2019s products do introduce a seam between the protector and phone, which could be a dealbreaker for some, but the Edge\u2019s silicone mitigates that somewhat. On the black iPhone 6, at least, it doesn\u2019t stand out too much, and it feels just as good to swipe in from the edge.\nIt\u2019s still unclear exactly what causes the iPhone 6 to bend in many situations, but  the ITG Edge could add some peace of mind. It\u2019s set to go on sale in the US this month for $39, or $45 for an iPhone 6 Plus model.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"This curved iPhone 6 screen protector could save you from Bendgate | The Verge","Tags":["apple","hands--on","tech","ces-2015"]}
