{"Main text":"FCC begins historic net neutrality vote with this incredible funk music\nGet down\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs we wait for the Federal Communications Commission to begin its historic meeting about net neutrality and the future of the internet, the FCC would like us to enjoy the smooth bass of New York funk and soul music. Over a static image announcing \"TODAY'S PROGRAM WILL BEGIN AT 10:30AM,\" we've now heard three different tracks by The Menahan Street Band, a Brooklyn-based group that formed in 2007 and released its most recent album in 2012.\n\"FCC\" now stands for \"Funky Communications Commission.\"  *waves* *shakes hands* *kisses baby* Thank you, thank you, I\u2019ll be here all week.\n\u2014 Sean O'Kane (@sokane1) February 26, 2015\nIf you want to listen along, visitÂ  FCC.com\/live or listen to the Menahan Street Band\/Save the Internet playlist.\nUPDATE: The FCC has begun playing Charles Bradley. The FCC has killer taste in soul music. The FCC might be trying to get laid. I was reluctant to write that, but as a journalist I'm obligated to pursue honesty and truth, and I believe it's the truth that the FCC doesn't want to sleep alone tonight.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
