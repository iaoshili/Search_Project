We've seen bits and pieces of Better Call Saul over the past few months, and now AMC has released a chat with its creators \u2014 including Gilligan \u2014 that goes behind the scenes and sets up the new series. Perhaps the standout quote here is from lead actor Bob Odenkirk, revealing how he committed to the show: he apparently told Gilligan, \"If you write it, I'll do it.\"\nThe website  SpoilerTV has also posted what it claims are the episode descriptions for the first five installments of the new series. While we can't say whether they're correct or not, the first description is a truncated version of what AMC officially released \u2014 and they all sound about as vague as TV listings usually get \u2014 so there's a chance these are right. As  SlashFilm points out , all the episode names rhyme. All five are reprinted below, including the full description for the first episode. FYI, Saul goes by the name Jimmy in this series, despite the name Saul being in the title. The show premieres on February 8th and 9th.\nEpisode 1, \"Uno\" \u2014 Jimmy works magic in the courtroom; after being inspired unexpectedly, Jimmy tries an unconventional method for pursuing potential clients.\nEpisode 2, \"Mijo\" \u2014 Jimmy's troubles escalate, leaving him in dire straits; carelessness puts Chuck at risk.\nEpisode 3, \"Nacho\" \u2014 Jimmy is eager to prove that his dangerous client is innocent.\nEpisode 4, \"Hero\" \u2014 Jimmy must face consequences when his relationships become strained.\nEpisode 5, \"Jello\" \u2014 Alarming news disrupts Jimmy's efforts at drumming up new business.\n","Title":"Vince Gilligan and Bob Odenkirk chat about Better Call Saul in new preview | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
