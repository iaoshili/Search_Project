{"Main text":"Up close with the HTC One M9\nMore complex manufacturing makes for a simpler design, but the differences are hard to spot\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe One M9 is HTC's flagship Android smartphone for 2015. It keeps the all-aluminum design of its predecessors while adding a new 20-megapixel camera, a bigger battery, and a faster processor. Here's our close-up look at the new device.\nAlthough the aesthetic and general shape are the same, the manufacturing process for HTC's 2015 aluminum unibody is quite different from the past. It takes 70 steps and over 300 production minutes to make each phone. A new anti-scratch coating is applied after a round of meticulous hand-polishing. The front bezel is now a single piece and there are fewer parts overall. HTC has made the manufacturing more complex in its pursuit of a simpler and cleaner design. Check out these photos and our in-depth preview of the phone to decide if the effort has paid off.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
