According to  The Hollywood Reporter , Lego Star Wars: Droid Tales will hit the same plot points as the Star Wars movies, but every episode will be told from the perspective of R2-D2 and C-3PO.\nThis time, it's in chronological order\nThe five-episode series will begin at the final scene of Return of the Jedi, after the Rebel Alliance victory on Endor, THR reports. The droids will re-tell the entire saga in the chronological order, starting with The Phantom Menace and looping back around to Return of the Jedi.\nWe've gotten a glimpse of what Lego Star Wars might look like  in a fan-made trailer for J.J. Abrams' upcoming movie  The Force Awakens , but we're guessing Disney's animation will be a little shinier. No word yet on who will be directing or writing the series, or what the  lightsabers will look like .\nThe TV mini series will reportedly air later this year. The Force Awakens comes out on December 18th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
