{"Main text":"TL;DR\nThis is what happens when a Predator drone falls out of the sky\nAn investigation by the Washington Post finds that military drones crash frequently, and includes a look at one burning out mid-flight\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith regulations for flying drones over the United States  slowly but surely coming , there's serious scrutiny on their safety. Meanwhile, a new Washington Post report may cast some doubt on military models' reliability: documents obtained by the paper detail how more than  400 large drones have crashed since 2001 \u2014 from communications failures, from mechanical errors and pilot mishaps, and occasionally sent straight into mountains to avoid catastrophe. Although none of the crashes caused deaths, the report isn't rosy for the future of unmanned flight. First, each crash can cost millions of dollars. Second, the crashes happened as frequently as fighter jet and attack plane crashes, despite representing a much smaller percentage of missions and flight hours. The Post's report, available  here , also features a video of a Predator drone coming down.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
