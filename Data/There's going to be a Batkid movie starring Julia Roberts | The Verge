That film originated from an Indiegogo campaign from filmmaker Dana Nachman, and successfully raised more than $100,000. It's premiering at  the Slamdance Film Festival in Utah tomorrow.\nPOW! ZAP! BAM!\nScott (who is in remission) spent that particular day battling fictional Batman villains like the Riddler and Penguin in a city-wide event that involved the collaboration of local police and government officials. The plan originally involved just a few hundred volunteers, though thousands showed up to participate. People outside of the city, including President Barack Obama  also got involved. Nachman's film promises to chronicle not only the day San Francisco became Gotham City, but also Scott's family and personal story.\nNo word yet on when this is planned for, or what Roberts' role will be. Here's the trailer from Nachman's film:\n","Title":"There's going to be a Batkid movie starring Julia Roberts | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
