Despite high image quality and a lot of buzz over the past few years, OLEDs have proved prohibitively expensive for home use. That's not stopping LG at CES 2015, though: it's got no fewer than seven models to show off.\nLG's offerings span the gamut from basic flatscreens to more experimental stuff, including three that won CES awards last year: a 55-inch flat model with a \"floating\" base, a 65-inch curved version, and a frankly gigantic 77-inch 4K OLED with a flexible display. Beyond that, there are curved versions of the 55-inch and 77-inch TVs and two flat versions of the 65-inch one, which means that you can probably find any permutation of giant, super-high-end TV you desire. The emphasis there is on \"super-high-end,\" because the smaller of LG's (and the world's) very first 4K OLEDs was launched for nearly $12,000 in Korea in 2014. You have to go all the way down  to 1080p resolution before you can get to the somewhat more reasonable price of $3,500. While the hardware is obviously the selling point for LG's TVs, the company is also  showing off its webOS 2.0 smart TV platform , and it's announced content partnerships with GoPro, DirecTV, and other companies.\nWhile LG has pushed forward with commercial OLEDs alongside other technology, other companies have shown reservations. A Samsung executive  said last year that the technology still wasn't ready for the mainstream, and Sony  reportedly gave up on them a few months before that, choosing to focus on better-selling LCD TV sets. They're  undeniably beautiful , with their super-thin design and rich colors. But for now, most people will only see them on a show floor \u2014 if they see them at all.\n","Title":"LG announces seven 4K OLED TVs, thinks OLED is cool when no one else does | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech","ces-2015"]}
