{"Main text":"The new Pee-wee movie will be a Netflix exclusive\n'Bowtie is the new black'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCome in, and pull yourself up a chair: the new, Judd Apatow-produced Pee-wee movie is called Pee-wee's Big Holiday , and rumors that it would be a Netflix exclusive have been confirmed. The production starts filming in three weeks, and John Lee (Broad City, Inside Amy Schumer, Delocated) will make his feature film debut as a director.\nNetflix is starting to push for feature-length exclusives\nNot only has Netflix become extremely successful at launching its own scripted series (House of Cards, Orange is the New Black) but it's also an attractive venue for existing projects looking for a home. Tina Fey's new project, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, was supposed to air on NBC but has since moved to Netflix and will debut on the streaming service next month. The new Pee-wee movie is no different \u2014 the project was originally set up at Universal Studios. While episodic series have been successful for Netflix, it has yet to establish itself as a viable platform for debuting feature-length films.\nBig Holiday will follow Pee-wee on his first-ever holiday after he's inspired by a \"fateful meeting with a mysterious stranger,\" but that's the only detail being released about the plot right now. Will Dottie return? Does Pee-wee still have his bike? Is Large Marge still haunting the Texas highways? We won't find out for a while, but you can keep up with Pee-wee's adventures as he updates his \"log\" (you know, blog without a 'b') while production starts up.\n","Title":"The new Pee-wee movie will be a Netflix exclusive | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
