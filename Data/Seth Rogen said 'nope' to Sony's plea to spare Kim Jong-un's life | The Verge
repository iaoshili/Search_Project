{"Main text":"Seth Rogen said 'nope' to Sony's plea to spare Kim Jong-un's life\nFilmmaker says casting Kim Jong-un as the villain was 'not an edgy position to take'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Interview director and co-star Seth Rogen has said that despite the controversial subject of his upcoming assassination comedy, he believes that casting the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a villain is \"not an edgy position to take.\" Rogen,  speaking to The New York Times , said: \"He is bad. It\u2019s controversial to him. But to everyone else, it\u2019s fine. To their credit, [Sony] let us do it.\"\nIn addition to Sony asking for the Kim Jong-un  death scene to be toned down (as revealed in leaked emails), we also learn that it requested for him not be killed at all. \"There was a moment where [the studio execs] were like: 'They\u2019ve threatened war over the movie. You kill him [Kim Jong-un]. Would you consider not killing him?' And we were like, 'Nope.'\"\nHowever, this interview with Rogen and co-star James Franco is likely to be one of the few discussing the film. Rogen and Franco have  backed out of planned press interviews after hackers  issued terror threats on any movie theaters showing The Interview. Some venues have  already cancelled planned screenings , and there's some speculation as to whether the film will still be released as currently scheduled on Christmas day.\nRogen suggests that the hackers didn't care about the film and just wanted to 'mess with a giant corporation'\nIn the interview with the Times, Rogen speculates that the hack on Sony Pictures might not have had anything to do with the release of the film. \"It could be some hacker that knew the situation with the movie and was using this as an opportunity to mess with a giant corporation,\" he says, adding that \"by the time it happened, millions and millions of people who could have many different motives had knowledge of the movie\u2019s existence.\"\nRogen also mentions that he's \"trying not to\" look at any of the leaked material \u2014 including internal memos and discussion \u2014 that have emerged from the hack. \"Ethically, I have problems with reading people\u2019s stolen emails,\" he tells the Times, before adding that he's now trying to be a \"little bit\" more careful with his own correspondence. \"I think everyone is. Aren\u2019t you?\"\n","Title":"Seth Rogen said 'nope' to Sony's plea to spare Kim Jong-un's life | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
