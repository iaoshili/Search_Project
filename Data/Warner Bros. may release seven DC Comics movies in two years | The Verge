{"Main text":"Warner Bros. may release seven DC Comics movies in two years\n'Man of Steel 2,' Shazam, and a Flash\/Green Lantern crossover on the way?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWarner Bros. is reportedly planning to launch a complete DC Comics movie universe in an attempt to emulate Marvel's success. Former Deadline editor Nikki Finke's new site,  NikkiFinke.com, claims the studio will announce a wide range of new films at San Diego Comic-Con in July, including formal confirmation of the standalone Wonder Woman movie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Sandman adaptation.\nThe plans are said to also include a Shazam (Captain Marvel) project for next summer, a joint Flash and Green Lantern movie for late 2017, and a  Man of Steel sequel for the following year. Together with Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and the  Justice League movie , the reported schedule would see Warner Bros. release seven DC movies between May 2016 and May 2018:\nMay 2016: Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\nJuly 2016: Shazam (Captain Marvel)\nChristmas 2016: The Sandman\nChristmas 2017: Flash and Green Lantern\nMay 2018: Man of Steel 2\nFinke reports that Batman v. Superman was delayed so as to provide a \"launching pad\" for the Justice League, with the projects set to feature multiple cameos from the comics universe in a similar fashion to Marvel movies like Iron Man and The Avengers. Arranging contracts for each superhero, including options for future movies, will have been a complex process. However, the plans are said to be \"in flux,\" so it's very possible all of this may not transpire in time for Comic-Con.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
