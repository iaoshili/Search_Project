{"Main text":"Zombie game series 'Dead Rising' is being turned into a movie\nHeading to Crackle, not theaters\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCapcom's Dead Rising is being turned into a movie, but it's hard to say if it'll be a very good one.Â  According to Variety , the zombie film is being made by the new (and untested) digital arm of Legendary, the studio behind Godzilla and Batman Begins, and it won't be heading to theaters. Instead, it's being made for Crackle, Sony's ad-supported movie- and TV-streaming service.\nBasically 'Dawn of the Dead' with more killing\nCrackle has dabbled in original content and found some huge success in Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, but that's still a decidedly low-budget affair (barring the talent, at least) compared to what's necessary to create the type of catchy zombie film needed to get viewers heading to its site.\nDead Rising was originally released for the Xbox 360 and its third iteration was released last year for Xbox One. The game itself takes some inspiration from film \u2014 the plot of the first game is basically Dawn of the Dead with a lot more action: your character is stuck in a mall, and you have to pick up whatever you can to fight off horde after horde of zombies. Altogether, it doesn't make for the worst film premise. A director reportedly hasn't been chosen yet, and there's no word on when it's targeted for release.\n","Title":"Zombie game series 'Dead Rising' is being turned into a movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
