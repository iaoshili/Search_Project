{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe YotaPhone 2, which ranks as one of the coolest and more novel Android smartphones in recent memory, is headed to the United States.  Phone Scoop reports that the company plans to launch an Indiegogo campaign in the spring and make the phone available for around $600. Should that prove successful \u2014 and  we have a good feeling it might \u2014 YotaPhone is also hoping to release the device through third-party retailers like Best Buy. The YotaPhone 2 will be able to run on either AT&T or T-Mobile with support for LTE. Early Indiegogo backers will receive exclusive incentives, but those haven't been finalized just yet.\nFrom the front, YotaPhone 2 looks like any other Android phone, but it's the e-paper display around back that's earned the device so much praise. With it, you can use your smartphone as a proper e-reader or display always-on app notifications (or maybe the weather). But any Android application can be mirrored onto the electronic paper display, which can save your phone's battery from calling it quits in a pinch. YotaPhone is still working on an Android 5.0 Lollipop update for the device and expects to have it ready around the time of US availability \"or shortly thereafter,\" according to PhoneScoop.\n","Title":"The YotaPhone 2 and its awesome e-paper display are coming to the US | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
