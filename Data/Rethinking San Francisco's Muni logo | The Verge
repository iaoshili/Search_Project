Since the mid-'70s, San Francisco's \"Muni\" Municipal Railway has been represented by a simple, stylized emblem. Four decades on, the logo has certainly aged, but it's now an iconic design statement loved by many. In a recent blog post , local designer Derek Kim lays out his vision for a new logo. Although it maintains the basic form, Kim's version eschews the varied widths of the present logo in favor of a more uniform look, and further integrates the \"i\" at the end by making it the same weight as the rest of the letters.\nThe simplified logo, Kim argues, could be rolled out in a number of ways. Its uniform nature makes it ideal as a repeat pattern that could adorn the sides of buses and trams. The designer has also worked the logo onto uniforms, and rethought the design of the service's pass and signage with bold yet simple visualizations of landmarks and areas. Kim doesn't expect the Municipal Transport Agency to suddenly rethink its livery \u2014 its money would probably be better spent improving the service \u2014 but it's an intriguing prospect nonetheless.
