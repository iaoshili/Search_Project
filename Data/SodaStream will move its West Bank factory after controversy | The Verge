The company drew criticism for having a factory in an Israeli settlement of the West Bank, an area occupied by Israel but claimed by Palestinians. Next year, the company says, that factory will be gone.\nThe factory will move by 2015\nSodaStream became the target of a boycott organized by activists, which also swept up the company's spokeswoman, Scarlett Johansson. Although a representative for SodaStream said the move will be for \"purely commercial\" reasons, the company has decided to shut down its current factory and open up shop in northern Israel by 2015,  the Associated Press reports . The company told the AP that it received $20 million from the Israeli government for the move, and the new factory will become its \"flagship manufacturing site.\"\nWhether it's caused by controversy or commerce, the company needs some kind of new strategy: after some major retailers decided to pull its products from stores, the company's stock has tanked, falling  more than 50 percent this year , while its revenue was down 41 percent in the most recent quarter.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
