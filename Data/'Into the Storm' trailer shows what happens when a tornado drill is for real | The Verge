{"Main text":"'Into the Storm' trailer shows what happens when a tornado drill is for real\nFire-burning, plane-churning...\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been a while since Hollywood offered us a good tornado movie ( Sharknado doesn't count, really). But that appears to be changing with Into the Storm. The found-footage disaster pic, which hits theaters in the US on August 8th, follows a pack of storm chasers and ordinary citizens trying to survive a series of tornadoes in the small town of Silverton. Whereas the first teaser focused on quick shots of harrowing tornado (and fire tornado) destruction scenes, the  new full-length trailer takes more time to set up the narrative, showing a high school graduation interrupted by tornado sirens and then... more destruction. So much of it. The film stars Richard Armitage (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey & Desolation of Smaug, Cinemax's Strike Back), Sarah Wayne Callies (AMC's The Walking Dead), and is directed by Steven Quale (Final Destination 5). It looks to be about as scary as anything they've ever done.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
