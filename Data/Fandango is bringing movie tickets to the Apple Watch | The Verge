{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Apple Watch news keeps coming: Fandango has announced that it will be bringing its ticket-buying service to the device. The Fandango app will provide several features designed to make getting to the movies as easy as possible. If customers have bought tickets through the service, they'll be able to pull up a scannable mobile ticket on their watch to get into theaters without fishing for their phone or a paper ticket. It will also provide reminders for upcoming movies, directions, a countdown until the movie actually starts, and general theater information. It will be available when the new device launches next month.\n\"We're excited to be one of the first apps available for Apple Watch, which takes moviegoing to a whole new level by providing quick access, once you've purchased tickets, to movie times, theater location, and more movie info conveniently on your wrist,\" Fandango president Paul Yanover said in a statement. \"We think the Apple Watch will ignite consumer excitement and help build momentum for the category.\"\nNot yet available on Android Wear\nWhile users won't be able to buy tickets from their Apple Watch, this kind of integration does go a long way towards articulating what kind of real-world scenarios the Apple Watch will be useful in. It's also a nice leg up on the competition: at this time, Fandango is not available on Android Wear. The Apple Watch itself will be available on April 24th \u2014 with starting princes ranging from $349 all the way up to a staggering $10,000.\nUpdate, 3:26PM ET: Added new availability information.\n","Title":"Fandango is bringing movie tickets to the Apple Watch | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","apple-watch-spring-event-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7927306"]}
