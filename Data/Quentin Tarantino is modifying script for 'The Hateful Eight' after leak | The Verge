Last night the writer-director staged a star-studded reading of the leaked script in Los Angeles, and he told the crowd of 1,200: \"I\u2019m working on a second draft and I will do a third draft.\"\n\"I\u2019m working on a second draft and I will do a third draft.\"\nAs is his hallmark, the story is split into several chapters, and Tarantino provided at least one clue as to how the script will change from its current form. According to Deadline , he said, \"The chapter five here will not be the chapter five later, so this will be the only time it is seen ever.\" The shocking conclusion to the original script has been spoiled for many since the script leaked out earlier this year. That leak led a distraught and highly disappointed Tarantino to cancel his plans to make the film , though he said at the time that \"if the muse calls me later to do it, we\u2019ll do it.\" Fortunately for fans looking forward to a true western from Tarantino, it appears he's decided not to throw the baby out with the bathwater \u2014 though his lawsuit with Gawker over the script is still plugging along.\nWhile the film is still a long, long ways out from hitting your local theater, the script reading last night in LA offers a delightful taste of what's to come. A cavalcade of Tarantino veterans including Samuel L Jackson, Kurt Russell, Walton Goggins, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, ZoÃ« Bell, and Nebraska star Bruce Dern rehearsed for three days with the fastidious director to bring it all together.\nAs you might expect, Tarantino took it very seriously. According to reports, he critiqued his actors during the performance, and even mandated that they redo a scene. At one point he jabbed \"Guys, you are starting to drift away from the dialogue on the page ... No more co-writing.\" Both The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline provide wonderful accounts of how the 177-minute-long evening went down \u2014 if you're looking forward to Tarantino's latest, be sure to give them a read.\n","Title":"Quentin Tarantino is modifying script for 'The Hateful Eight' after leak | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
