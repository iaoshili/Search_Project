{"Main text":"Jawbone Up24 at Amazon ($75)\nThere is a litany of fitness trackers available these days, and if the amount of gadgets we saw at CES are any indication, the market is only going to keep getting flooded. We've already sorted through some of that mess, and right now Jawbone's Up24 is the best we've found . It's dead simple to use, it has a great app and works well with others, and Amazon is offering it for cheap \u2014 just $75.\nHubsan X4 drone at Newegg ($49)\nThe DJI Phantom has become the Kleenex of consumer drones, but not everyone has $1,000 or more to plunk down on their first foray into becoming a quadcopter pilot. Luckily, there's a growing market for cheap mini-drones, and one of our favorites to fly around the office is this Hubsan X4. Be warned, however, that it's fully manual; there's no advanced GPS stabilization or anything like it here. It comes with an extra body and propellors for when you inevitably break it, which \u2014 trust us \u2014 you will. If the walls in our office could talk, they'd tell you the same thing.\nLittle Big Planet 3 at Best Buy ($39)\nShooters! MMORPGs! Photo-realistic racing games! Sure, next-gen consoles are tailor-made for these kinds of games, but that doesn't mean you should overlook a game like Little Big Planet 3. Yeah, it's adorable, but it's also challenging, engaging, and great to play with other people. If you want to put down the gun and pick up a potato sack instead, Best Buy is selling the newest installation in the series for $20 off.\n40-inch LG 4K TV at B&H ($550)\nAnother thing we learned at CES is that 4K televisions are the new standard. Even without abundant content, the prices have started dropping on these ultra high-definition sets \u2014 just look at this 40-inch option LG has available for $550. If you don't have a giant living room to fill (like those of us Verge staffers living in shoebox New York apartments), this should be in the running for your first 4K set.\nLearn more\n","Title":"Price Check: a discounted MacBook Pro, LG's bargain 4K set, and our favorite cheap drone | The Verge","Tags":["good-deals","tech"]}
