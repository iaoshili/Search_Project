{"Main text":"Watch the first trailer for the Dead Rising movie\nHeading to Crackle March 27th\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere it is, your first look at Dead Rising: Watchtower, the  film adaptation of Capcom's popular zombie video game series coming to Crackle on March 27th. If this preview is any indication, the movie will be chockfull of nods to its origin, from makeshift weapons to psychopathic clowns. As best as we can tell, the story centers with a new outbreak possibly related to Zombrex, a medicine used to slow or halt the zombification process. There's no subtlety here, this is full-on fan service: In one scene, we noticed a large teddy bear in the background (which is used to make weapons in the games) and an Xbox One controller in the foreground.\nRob Riggle appears as Frank West , the first Dead Rising's protagonist, but framed as a \"zombie expert\" on a low-class TV news show \u2014 no killing whatsoever. Let's hope that isn't the case in the final film: if Dead Rising: Watchtower was made with fans in mind (which seems to be entirely the case), there's no reason to hold back.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
