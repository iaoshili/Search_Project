{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAll of the pieces are falling into place for an overhauled Apple TV, and we may just see one come June.  According to BuzzFeed News , Apple is planning to debut a revamped Apple TV at its World Wide Developers Conference. The new box will reportedly support third-party apps, voice control with Siri, and presumably the internet-TV service that  The Wall Street Journal described earlier this week. BuzzFeed says that the new device will likely include more storage and a version of Apple's latest mobile chip, the A8.\nApple's more serious entrance into the living room has been long awaited. And, really, it's about time. The Apple TV has been a nice but overly simple box for most of its lifespan. The addition of an App Store, which BuzzFeed says will be included, would make it dramatically more capable and interesting, allowing apps and games to take over an entire TV. If Apple's long-rumored internet-TV service makes an appearance as well, the Apple TV would quickly become a major play for the living room. BuzzFeed reports that the Apple TV will include basic home automation features, too, however some are already built into the model that's shipping today. Apple recently  reduced the price of that model to $69.\nVerge Video: Everything to know from Apple's Spring Forward Event\n","Title":"Apple reportedly debuting new Apple TV with App Store and Siri in June | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
