{"Main text":"Facebook's psychological study  altering hundreds of thousands of users\u2019 News Feeds to investigate \"emotional contagion\" was the most shared academic paper of 2014.\nThe study \u2013 published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and given the title \" Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks \" \u2013 was tweeted a total of 3,631 times, linked to by 169 different news outlets, and cited on 107 blogs, according to the  data published by Altmetric .\nusers were outraged, but had unknowingly given permission for the experiments\nHowever, these figures are far from comprehensive and don\u2019t take into account the hundreds upon hundreds of stories and thinkpieces written and shared about the incident over the following weeks. Although Facebook initially equivocated and refused to admit wrongdoing, it was later revealed that the experiment was only  one of hundreds carried out on users (all perfectly legal under the site\u2019s terms and conditions), and the company was  forced to apologize later in the year.\nAs far as notorious research goes the second-most cited paper in Altmetric\u2019s data is more embarrassing than Facebook\u2019s (although less of a concern for the ethics board). \" Variation in Melanism and Female Preference in Proximate but Ecologically Distinct Environments \" sounds like a dry read but the research  became Twitter famous after grad student Dave Harris spotted a single comment in parentheses that had apparently slipped through the peer review process: \"Should we cite that crappy Gabor paper here?\" Facebook may have disrespected their users, but at least they didn't diss fellow scientists.\nNot sure how this made it through proofreading, peer review, and copyediting.
