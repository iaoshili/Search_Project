It's CGI!\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCampy horror classic The Blob is getting a remake,  Deadline reports . The movie, about a small town terrorized by a hungry, vicious villain from another planet, is known for its shoddy graphics, strange premise, and the launch of Steve McQueen's acting career.\nSimon West, (Con-Air, The Expendables 2) will direct the movie for Goldcrest Films; Richard Saperstein and Brian Witten (Silent Night) will produce. In what may be a boon to fans of the original, Jack Harris, the 96-year-old producer of the 1958 movie, is credited as an executive producer.\nIt creeps! It crawls!\n\"With modern CGI we can now fully realize the potential of The Blob,\" West said in a press release. \"The world I create will be totally believable, immersive and emotionally satisfying.\"\nBut do we want The Blob to be totally believable? Remember, Rob Zombie tried to do this is 2009 and gave up, so it's not so easy to make a monster that's basically a giant ball of grape jelly truly terrifying.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
