{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAquaman has bulked up since the DC Comics superhero  first started roaming the seas. Zack Snyder, who is directing the upcoming Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, tweeted the first image of Jason Momoa tonight dressed as the underwater hero. Momoa, most famous for his role in Game of Thrones, looks like an ocean-dwelling version of Khal Drogo.\nThere is only one true King. #unitetheseven pic.twitter.com\/RDFG8jbuI6\n\u2014 ZackSnyder (@ZackSnyder) February 20, 2015\nSnyder's \"Unite the Seven\" tagline could either be a reference to the seven seas, or to the seven members of the Justice League. It's reported that the director will use the upcoming Batman v. Superman to introduce the entire superhero squad,  fleshing DC Comics' movies out to rival the scope of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Look for other characters, including Wonder Woman, the Flash, and the Martian Manhunter, to be revealed on Snyder's feed over the coming weeks.\nSnyder has arguably started slow \u2014 Aquaman's always been something of a poor relation to the rest of the Justice League. Where Superman can fly, shoot lasers from his eyes, and turn back time by spinning the planet too fast, Aquaman can talk to fish. The idea of a gritty, rebooted Aquaman covered in tribal tattoos isn't totally convincing just yet, but Snyder obviously believes in the character \u2014 the director  recently called in to a Detroit radio show to defend the hero. At least Momoa's Aquaman looks like he'd jab you with his trident if you called him useless.\nVerge Video Archives: Batman vs. Superman: Who would really win in a fight?\n","Title":"This is the first image of Jason Momoa as Aquaman | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
