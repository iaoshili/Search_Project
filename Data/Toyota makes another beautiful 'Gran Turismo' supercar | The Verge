{"Main text":"Toyota makes another beautiful 'Gran Turismo' supercar\nYou can't buy an FT-1 \u2014 yet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEarlier this year, Toyota created the gorgeous FT-1 for \"Vision Gran Turismo,\" an ongoing series of concept cars designed by real-world car companies and design studios in collaboration with Sony's Polyphony Digital for the release of Gran Turismo 6 . The high-performance sports car was widely believed to be a teaser for a reboot of the Supra, a legendary franchise for Toyota that last saw production in 2002.\nThose rumors are louder than ever this week now that Toyota has revealed a second version of the FT-1 that it describes as a more \"sophisticated\" and \"premium\" take on the original, painted in a dark silver in place of the bright, sporty red seen before. Both versions look fantastic.\nWhile there's no word on production, the new FT-1 will be available as an in-game download in Gran Turismo 6 next month, along with a high-performance track model called the FT-1 Vision GT seen in the video below. If Toyota doesn't find a way to produce the FT-1 as a real vehicle, it'll be missing a big opportunity to inject emotional design into a brand best known for its practicality.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
