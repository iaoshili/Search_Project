{"Main text":"These Alien 35th anniversary posters are gorgeous and gruesome\n'It set the tone for virtually every sci-fi \/ space movie.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAlien has seemingly been everywhere this year. We've seen blockbuster games dedicated to recreating the tension of Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror classic , and fan projects that turn the late H.R. Giger's most famous creation into incredibly detailed sculptures . All this despite the fact that the seminal film came out in 1979 \u2014 and to celebrate the 35th anniversary, Poster Posse has curated a collection of Alien posters from some of the best artists around.\n\"Alien will always be regarded as one of the most terrifying films of all time,\" says artist Robert Bruno, who contributed to the project, \"and rightfully so. It set the tone for virtually every sci-fi \/ space movie and was remarkably inventive and ambitious for its time.\" The posters all take a very different tack on the film, and use different art styles, but each manages to evoke the \"in space no one can hear you scream\" tagline quite well. For more on the project \u2014 including how to buy some of these prints \u2014 check out Poster Posse .\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
