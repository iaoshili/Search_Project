The BBC announced today that it has begun production on an audio drama adaptation of Good Omens, the hit 1990 comedic fantasy novel about the apocalypse from celebrated authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Both authors are onboard to help develop the miniseries, which has already begun recording in a secret location in London, for a scheduled airing on BBC Radio 4 sometime in December. It will span five half-hour-long episodes and one hour-long finale.\nDirk Maggs is directing, a natural choice given he was also the director of the BBC's well-received radio adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere last year. The BBC also released a full voice cast list for Good Omens today, noting that Gaiman and Pratchett will appear in cameo roles, along with surprise guests.
