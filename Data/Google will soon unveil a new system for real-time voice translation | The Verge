{"Main text":"Google will soon unveil a new system for real-time voice translation\nThe move follows a similar program released from Skype\nLast month, Microsoft's Skype  unveiled a program for real-time translation of human speech. Now, it seems we'll soon be seeing Google's version.\nGoogle has said it's working on a system for \"near-perfect\" translation\nThe New York Times reports that Google is about to release an updated version of its Google Translate app for Android. The update will include a system that automatically recognizes speech in popular languages and changes it into text. To be sure, the Translate app can already translate speech \u2014 but this update could be much more. As far back as  July 2013 , Google was saying an upcoming version would be able to deliver delay-free, \"near perfect\" translations, something few apps \u2014 including current Google offerings \u2014 could reasonably claim.\nThat might not be all we soon see, either. The Times also notes Google will be releasing \"a service that enables you to hold your phone up to a foreign street sign and create an automatic translation on the screen.\"\nVerge Video Archives: A Brief History of Android\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
