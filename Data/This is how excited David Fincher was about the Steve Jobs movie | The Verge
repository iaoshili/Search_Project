{"Main text":"This is how excited David Fincher was about the Steve Jobs movie\nAaron Sorkin\u2019s film is 'two auditoriums, a restaurant, and a garage'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith the ongoing leak of Sony emails and documents , we\u2019ve been treated to a torrent of behind-the-scenes snark, posturing, and deal-making, particularly when it comes to the embattled Steve Jobs biopic . What we haven\u2019t see thus far is a copy of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s screenplay \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of new information about the project, including what director David Fincher thought when he first read the script.\nThough the filmmaker was never able to close a deal to direct the adaptation (Danny Boyle will now take on the movie over at Universal , with Prometheus star Michael Fassbender reportedly playing the title role), in a February email he was beyond enthusiastic:\nFrom: David Fincher\nTo: Amy Pascal, Scott Rudin (Personal), Mike De Luca\nCc: Aaron Sorkin\nSent: Feb 23, 2014 3:34 PM\nSubject: JOBS\nIs great.  It\u2019s a play, but a really quicksilver, cinematic one.\nI would think you would want to cast and rehearse very carefully (couple months)\nShoot very quickly (4 or 5 weeks \u2014 8 days per ACT??)\nThe venues would be easy (we could probably find them all in town)\nEditing is where we would spend time.\nCan SONY market a ONE MAN SHOW(?)\nCan you guys make the LENNY of it all, the MUST SEE?\nThe latter is a reference to Lenny, Bob Fosse's 1974 biopic about comedian Lenny Bruce that starred Dustin Hoffman and was adapted from the stage play of the same name.\nEven after Fincher deal started falling apart, Sorkin continued to lobby for the director despite friction during Fincher\u2019s negotiation. \"I do not know why he\u2019s like this (anymore than I know why Steve Jobs was like Steve Jobs),\" Sorkin wrote to Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin on March 27th, just weeks before the director dropped out , \"and I don\u2019t want this movie to be a bitter drink for the people at the top because you all have other things you can do and you\u2019ll just walk away. But we\u2019re looking at a home run pitch coming at us.\"\n\"It\u2019s a play, but a really quicksilver, cinematic one.\"\nThe emails also contain passing glimpses at the project Sorkin\u2019s put together. He said as far back as 2012 that his script would consist of three major scenes , and in another March email he writes that the film would require just four locations to shoot: \"two auditoriums, a restaurant and a garage.\" (What will one of those auditoriums be? In an email from last month, Sorkin directly references Symphony Hall \u2014 the San Francisco venue where Steve Jobs held the first NeXT introduction event.)\nNo matter what ups and downs the Jobs project has faced, it\u2019s pretty clear that one person is going to be happy with the finished product: Steve Jobs author Walter Isaacson. After reading the script, Isaacson gushed to Rudin in a February email. \"The script is totally awesome. I have a tear in my eye having just finished. I was deeply moved by the narrative arc and by the beautiful end. I loved the line, \u2018No way she\u2019s not my kid,\u2019\" he wrote, in what seems to be a clear reference toÂ  Jobs\u2019 daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs .\n\"Alright!\" Sorkin wrote to Pascal and Rudin in response. \"I wanted that endorsement bad.\"\n","Title":"This is how excited David Fincher was about the Steve Jobs movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","report","entertainment","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622","2794100"]}
