{"Main text":"Robin Williams' daughter returns to Twitter after suffering threats and abuse\nReferences Harvey Fierstein quote: 'never be bullied into silence.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nZelda Williams, the 25-year-old daughter of the late actor Robin Williams, publicly said she was  deleting Twitter from her devices last month after becoming victim to a deluge of abusive comments in the days following her father's suicide on August 11th. The sustained harassment, coming from several users in particular, was so bad that one of Twitter's executives later said the  company was evaluating changes to curb future incidents. Even though Twitter has yet to implement any of those changes, Zelda Williams has now returned to the social network. She  posted her first tweet in almost a month yesterday, linking to a  post on her Tumblr blog quoting writer\/actor Harvey Fierstein, who worked alongside her father in Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\u2014 Zelda Williams (@zeldawilliams) September 1, 2014\nAt a time when the internet is showing  some of people's  ugliest behaviors , its good to see Williams isn't letting her abusers have the last word.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
