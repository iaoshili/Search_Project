{"Main text":"Watch the first ever video of a laser beam moving through thin air\nThe six-nanosecond-long clip was shot at 20 billion frames per second\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor the first time ever scientists have captured a video of a laser\u2019s flight path as it moves through the air. The clip above was created using a new ultra high-speed camera  capable of detecting single photons at a time \u2014 the smallest amount of light possible. To create the video, researchers from the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh in the UK recorded 2 million laser pulses over a 10 minute period, aggregating individual collisions of photons with air particles to map the laser\u2019s entire flight path.\nThe new camera is so accurate that it shows the shape of the laser pulse\n\"This is the first time we\u2019ve looked at light just passing by,\" lead researcher  Genevieve Gariepy tells The Verge. \"Usually you have to see light reflecting off things.\" In the case of lasers, observing the light is even more difficult as the photons are all moving in the same direction in a tightly focused beam. You only see the light from a laser when it bounces off an object or when something like smoke or gas is blown over it, giving the photons more particles to collide with. Gariepy explains that slightly smeared look of the laser in the video \u2014 a little like watching the aurora borealis in slow motion \u2014 shows just how precise the camera is. \"The pulse has a shape: it\u2019s not just a rectangle moving through the air.\"\nThe experiment is a step forward from research published in 2011 in which MIT physicists successfully recorded  light pulses passing through a Coke bottle . The same scientists worked on this new experiment, and Gariepy explains that this  process is quicker than the older work (taking 10 minutes to record instead of one hour) and uses a camera no bigger than a digital compact, while the MIT apparatus was projector-sized. \"They also had to fill the bottle with water and milk [to record the laser], meaning that some of the light bounced off those particles,\" says Gariepy, who adds that the new camera may not capture as many frames per second, but it is \"a lot more sensitive, allowing us to see the light bouncing off air molecules.\"\nTechnology like this could help us create cameras that can see around corners\nThe camera itself only records 1024 pixels in a 32 by 32 grid, but Gariepy says it paves the way for practical applications in the future. Being able to record photons this accurately offers two new channels of data, she says, spatial and temporal. The temporal information can be used to study dynamic processes that happen very fast while the spatial data could be used to see around corners by recording photons bouncing off hidden objects and returning to the camera. \"It\u2019s the same principle as LIDAR but more sensitive,\" says Gariepy. She explains that while work has already been done in this area (see the video below from 2012), the new camera is a step forward in terms of portability. \"Right now it\u2019s just plugged into my computer, but it could be used by just taking it outside and recording movies for yourself.\"\n","Title":"Watch the first ever video of a laser beam moving through thin air | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
