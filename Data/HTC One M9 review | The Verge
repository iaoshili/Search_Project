{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDéjà vu (noun): a feeling that one has seen or heard something before\nI\u2019ve spent the better part of the last two weeks with HTC\u2019s new One M9. It\u2019s the latest flagship from the once-powerful smartphone maker and the successor to last year\u2019s One M8 . The M9 is exceptionally similar to its forebear: it\u2019s nearly all aluminum, has a 5-inch, 1080p screen, has really loud speakers above and below that screen, and is unmatched in build quality, craftsmanship, and design in the Android world.\nThe M8 was a great smartphone \u2014 it was beautiful and fast and featured inoffensive software, great sound, and a sharp screen. The M9 has all of those traits, but it\u2019s also been specifically designed to right the M8\u2019s two major faults: a finish that was too slippery to hold and a camera that took sub-par pictures. Of those two things, the camera is far more important: the M8\u2019s disappointing camera was the big factor holding it back from being great.\nFor the past two weeks, I\u2019ve been trying to shake the feeling that I\u2019ve seen this all before, that I\u2019ve acted out this scenario already. But I can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been living in smartphone déjà vu.\nDéjà vu experiences can be great, frustrating, or even surreal. In the case of the M9, it\u2019s a bit of everything. I\u2019m going to start with the good, because really, there is a lot of good here. The One M9 has a beautiful design, beautiful finish, feels great in the hand, and doesn\u2019t look like a copy of any other smartphone \u2014 except, well, the M8. But that\u2019s not a bad thing, the M8 was a great looking phone and the M9 is too.\nThe main visual differences between the two are the sharper edges of the M9 and the power button, which finally moved from the top of the M8 to the side of the M9. HTC says its goal was to blend the best of the M7 from two years ago with last year\u2019s M8 and I\u2019d say the company succeeded. The M9 you\u2019re most likely to see dons a new two-tone color scheme: it\u2019s silver on the front and back with gold on the sides. I\u2019m not a huge fan of it, but the other color options (all gold, black, or even pink) look nicer. The finish is shinier than last year\u2019s mostly matte surface, which works to make the phone less slippery than before.\nUsing the M9 feels largely the same as the M8 from last year\nThe relocated power button is also much easier to use on the M9, but it\u2019s too easily confused with the volume buttons just above it. A simple fix would be to put the volume buttons on the opposite side as the power button, but overall this is a pretty minor complaint.\nOn the whole, the experience of holding, using, touching, and taking the M9 in and out of pockets is the same as it was with the M8, save for the lack of worrying that the phone was going to slip out of my hands like a bar of soap at any given moment. The M9 is slightly shorter and ever so slightly thicker than last year\u2019s phone, but it\u2019s not noticeably different in everyday use.\nThe same can be said for the M9\u2019s 5-inch, 1080p display and front-facing speakers. The screen is color accurate and bright enough for outdoor use. It doesn\u2019t have as many pixels as other smartphone displays, but it\u2019s dense enough that it\u2019s impossible to see any individual pixels or jagginess with the naked eye. Those signature front-facing stereo Boom Sound speakers still sound great too, and the M9\u2019s are even a tad louder this time around.\nThe M9 is also really fast. It\u2019s got Qualcomm\u2019s new flagship Snapdragon 810 processor and 3GB of RAM, which means I almost never have to wait for an app to open or for the homescreen to redraw itself. This isn\u2019t to say the M8 was slow \u2014 it wasn\u2019t by any means \u2014 but the M9 bring a whole new level of speed. It\u2019s easily the fastest Android phone I\u2019ve used. That speed also comes with efficiency: the battery is slightly larger in the M9 than in the M8 and it consistently went all day on a single charge. It won\u2019t last for more than a day off of the charger as larger phablets with their even bigger batteries can, but if you\u2019re used to charging your phone every night anyways, it\u2019ll easily get the job done.\nThe M9 is easily one of the fastest Android phones I've ever used\nPart of that speedy experience also is thanks to the new version of Sense, the software that HTC layers on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It\u2019s responsive and quick, and unlike other custom Android interfaces, doesn\u2019t slow down the experience at all. It\u2019s visually very similar to the software on the M8 and has most all of the same features. But there two new standout components: a new theming engine that lets you quickly customize the look and sound of the software, and a widget for the homescreen that attempts to predict which apps you\u2019ll need based on your location.\nThe theming ability is cool and fun to play with. You can quickly change the wallpaper, app icons, fonts, sounds, and more on your M9 with a variety of downloadable theme packs. Or you can create one on HTC\u2019s website and upload it to your phone or share it publicly. You can even build a custom theme based on the colors in a picture you take. The theming does more than I expected it to and it smartly leverages Android\u2019s customizability in fun ways.\nI\u2019m less impressed with the predictive widget. It\u2019s supposed to serve appropriate apps for work, home, or travel based on your location. Perhaps my email and calendar apps will float to the top when I\u2019m at the office, while Maps and music are displayed when I hit the road. It\u2019s a useful idea in theory (and it\u2019s not particularly novel \u2014there are a host of third party app launchers that promise the same things), but HTC\u2019s execution needs work. It takes too long to learn my habits and it populates the widget with a folder of suggested apps, many of which were comically off base or already installed on the phone. (I have nothing against Canada, but I\u2019ve been in New York the entire time I\u2019ve used the M9 and it still insisted that I download the Canadian Post app.) Fortunately, it is just a widget, which means you can easily remove it from the home screen and forget about it.\nBut just as last year\u2019s M8 had a lot going for it along with a few critical flaws, not everything is perfect with the M9. The biggest problem with the M8 was its lackluster camera, a low-resolution \"Ultra Pixel\" camera that just didn\u2019t compare to the best cameras from Apple or Samsung. It was paired with a secondary sensor to do depth of field tricks that proved to be more gimmicky than useful.\nFor the M9, HTC took a completely different approach: its main camera has a high-resolution, 20-megapixel sensor and that secondary sensor is gone. The UltraPixel camera has moved to the front, where it actually works pretty well for low-light selfies and its lower pixel count isn\u2019t as much of a problem. The new main camera has lots of pixels though \u2014 a direct response to criticisms that the M8\u2019s camera wasn\u2019t high resolution enough.\nThe M9's new camera doesn't result in better pictures\nUnfortunately, this new approach doesn\u2019t result in any better pictures, and in many cases, images taken with the M9 are worse than they were last year. The M9 has the pixel count the M8 lacked, but all too often the images are fraught with noise reduction and smearing of details. Low light pictures often have odd color casts and there\u2019s unpleasant blooming in highlights. In well lit scenes, the M9 has trouble exposing wide ranges of light to dark areas.\nThe actual camera software on the M9, the app that you use to take photos, is great. It\u2019s fast and easy to use, and provides quick access to photographic controls such as white balance if you want them. But the end result just isn\u2019t as good as it should be, certainly not for a flagship smartphone in 2015.\nHTC One M9 image on the left, iPhone 6 image on the right (Images cropped and resized for the web)\nI tested the M9 against the iPhone 6 side-by-side in a variety of situations, and the M9\u2019s images were softer, not as well exposed, filled with noise reduction artifacts that gave them a watercolor look, and often had inaccurate white balance. The iPhone 6 took better pictures in nearly every comparison. Apple (and to a certain extent, Samsung) has a huge advantage that HTC doesn\u2019t: it controls its supply chain very tightly and can choose from the best camera components before anyone else. It's a disadvantage that HTC hasn't been able to overcome, and it's very obvious with the M9's camera.\nIf there was one thing HTC had to get right with the M9, it was the camera. The design didn\u2019t change, the screen isn\u2019t new, the software is largely the same. The camera is where HTC focused all of its efforts and it came up short.\nThe original French adjective from which déjà vu is drawn from literally translates to \"already seen.\" In the case of the One M9, much of it, from the good to the bad, has already been seen.\nOn the good side, the M9 is a beautifully designed smartphone, with a great screen, great sound, speedy performance, and all-day battery life. It\u2019s just like last year\u2019s phone in those respects. But on the ugly side, the M9\u2019s camera is a huge disappointment, not only because it doesn\u2019t improve upon last year\u2019s M8, but because it simply doesn\u2019t work as well as many of the other phones you can choose from.\nThe M9 doesn\u2019t do anything to improve HTC\u2019s position against the rest of ultra-competitive premium smartphone world. Samsung, HTC\u2019s closest competitor, has dramatically closed the gap in terms of hardware and design with its forthcoming Galaxy S6. And by all accounts, it will have a far superior camera as well. The iPhone has long been a phone with great design and picture quality that beats most point and shoot cameras you can buy.\nFor the third year in a row, HTC has a really compelling phone with a disappointing camera\nSmartphones aren\u2019t just phones anymore, they are increasingly the only cameras that people own or use. People often pick a phone based solely on how well it takes pictures and the phone\u2019s camera can make or break the device . In the case of the M9 (and the M8 before it), it breaks it.\nFor the third year in a row, HTC has produced one of the most visually alluring smartphones that feels as incredible as it looks. And for the third year in a row, it has show-stopping flaws, which bring the great experience you\u2019re having to a screeching halt.\nHere\u2019s one more definition: \"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"\nProduct photography by Sean O'Kane.\n","Title":"HTC One M9 review | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","review","tech"]}
