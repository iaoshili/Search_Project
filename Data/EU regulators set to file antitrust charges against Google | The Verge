{"Main text":"EU regulators set to file antitrust charges against Google\nThe other shoe finally drops on a five-year investigation\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition commissioner, will  reportedly announce formal charges against Google tomorrow. The EU's top antitrust watchdog will go after the search giant for favoring its own services over rivals during web searches. Google tried to settle the case last year, but that fell apart after strong objections from European nations, telecoms, and media companies.\nThe European Union has long had a contentious relationship with Google. Its parliament approved a resolution last year  calling for the breakup of the company's search and advertising business. Google is seen by many EU members as a far too powerful gatekeeper to the world's information, with a  90 percent market share of search activity in Europe. If it's found to have violated the EU's antitrust laws, the company could face  penalties of over $6 billion .\nGoogle has also been contending with the EU-mandated \" right to be forgotten \" since last year. It is clearly eager to avoid the kind of protracted battle that consumed Microsoft, which  paid billions over the last decade after refusing to comply with an antitrust order from the European courts. The latest news, however, has inclined experts to think that EU regulators won't agree to settlement, but will pursue \"fines and injunctions\" instead.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
