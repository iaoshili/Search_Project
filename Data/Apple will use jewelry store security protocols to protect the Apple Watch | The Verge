{"Main text":"Apple will use jewelry store security protocols to protect the Apple Watch\nThe Apple Watch Edition won't be cheap\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple is looking to jewelry stores as a guide to protect the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition, which  may run into the thousands of dollars , according to a report from  Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac . To increase security in its Apple Stores, Apple has begun placing safes fitted with MagSafe chargers in each of its stores to secure the Apple Watch Edition overnight, and scales to weigh the Watch upon return, to make sure no gold has been removed from the watch, according to Gurman, who has an excellent track record with Apple reports. Both demo units and inventory of the Watch Edition will be placed in the safe, presumably to avoid the robberies Apple Stores around the world have  fallen victim to in the past .\nThe Apple Watch Edition will be secured in a safe overnight\nThe scale is telling \u2014 you would only need to weigh returned products if there was a significant amount of gold that could be removed from the device, which means the Watch Edition definitely won't be cheap. Apple hasn't said how much the Watch Edition will cost, but the lengths it is apparently taking to protect it shows that Apple intends for the Watch Edition to be unlike any device it has ever sold before. The Apple Watch goes  on sale in April .\n","Title":"Apple will use jewelry store security protocols to protect the Apple Watch | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","apple-watch-spring-event-2015"]}
