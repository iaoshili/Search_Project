{"Main text":"US creates centralized cybersecurity agency following Sony attack\nCyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center will be tasked with sharing intelligence and coordinating responses to major attacks\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe White House today will announce the creation of a new agency tasked with thwarting cyberattacks by sharing intelligence across other agencies in the event of a crisis,  The Washington Post reports . The new Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) will be formally unveiled at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, later today. The unit will be created as part of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and will start off with a staff of about 50 people and a budget of $35 million, officials tell the Post.\nThe idea is to apply lessons learned after the September 11th terrorist attacks \u2014 which were blamed, in part, on intelligence failures \u2014 to the realm of cybersecurity. The new agency will be structured like the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), created in the aftermath of September 11th, and will be charged with analyzing and coordinating responses to cyberthreats.\n\"The cyberthreat is one of the greatest threats we face.\"\n\"The cyberthreat is one of the greatest threats we face, and policymakers and operators will benefit from having a rapid source of intelligence,\" Lisa Monaco, President Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, tells the Post. Monaco will announce the creation of the CTIIC in a speech at today's event. \"It will help ensure that we have the same integrated, all-tools approach to the cyberthreat that we have developed to combat terrorism.\"\nMonaco had been pushing for the creation of a new agency for several months, amid signs of the growing dangers that cyberattacks posed, but the initiative gained new momentum following last year's  hack of Sony Pictures . The response to that attack, Monaco says, demonstrated the need for a centralized body to analyze intelligence gathered from various agencies \u2014 in this case, the FBI, NSA, and CIA \u2014 and the White House agreed. Earlier this month, Obama announced  new measures to protect companies who share their data with federal intelligence agencies following cyberattacks, in the hope that doing so will help coordinate responses.\nExperts say accessing data from private sector companies will be critical to the CTICC's effectiveness going forward, but others aren't convinced that creating another government agency is the answer. \"We should not be creating more organizations and bureaucracy,\" Melissa Hathaway, a former White House cybersecurity coordinator, tells the Post. \"We need to be forcing the existing organizations to become more effective \u2014 hold them accountable.\"\n","Title":"US creates centralized cybersecurity agency following Sony attack | The Verge","Tags":["web","policy","us-world","national-security"]}
