{"Main text":"Jolla's 13,000 backers raised $1.8 million to build a tablet\nJolla says it will ship the tablet by May 2015\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThree weeks afterÂ  launching a crowdfunding campaign for its new tablet on Indiegogo, Jolla has announced it has raised $1.8 million, blowing past the $380,000 it was asking for. Jolla has also raised a round of corporate funding totaling \u20AC34 million ($42.2 million), giving the company a strong financial base to build the tablet running its custom-built Sailfish OS.\nOver 13,000 people backed Jolla's Indiegogo campaign\nWith a 2,048 x 1,536 pixel resolution, 64-bit 1.8GHz quad-core Intel processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and the ability to run Android apps, the specs match up with what you would expect from a modern tablet. The Finnish company has been positioning its 7.85-inch tablet as a cheaper alternative to the iPad mini and Android tablets, focusing on improving multitasking, which the company sees as the biggest pain point for tablet users. Jolla also wants its community to be involved in the creation of the tablet, asking users to suggest features and vote on proposed ideas, which will then be vetted by the Jolla development team.\nThe question now: can the Jolla tablet deliver on all of its promise?
