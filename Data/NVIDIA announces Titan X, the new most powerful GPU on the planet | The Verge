Huang claims it is the most powerful GPU on the planet. With 12GB frame buffer and 8 billion transistors, it is \u2014 on paper \u2014 a significant step past NVIDIA's current hardware. NVIDIA's Titan used to be its most powerful hardware.\nHuang autographed the GPU's box and gifted the hardware to Epic Games' co-founder Tim Sweeney. \"As a result of Tim calling me,\" said Huang, \"and his phone call was, 'Can you save GDC' [\u2026] we decided to launch Titan X at the Epic event. This has never happened before in the history of our industry.\"\nHuang came to the stage after Sweeney gave a lengthy speech about the convergence of photorealistic imagery, film, video games, architecture, industrial design, and virtual reality. \"This GDC,\" said Huang, \"is all about VR. And there are all these demos that are just unbelievable ... [it] needs an amazing GPU.\"\nHuang implied NVIDIA's Titan X is a step in that direction.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
