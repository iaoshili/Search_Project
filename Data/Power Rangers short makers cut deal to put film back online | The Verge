{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe gritty  Power\/Rangers short film viewed by millions earlier this week is back on  YouTube and  Vimeo .  According to Deadline , the film's creators have struck a deal with Saban, which owns the rights to Power Rangers, and are now free to put their short anywhere online. The YouTube and Vimeo versions now come with extensive disclaimers noting that they present a fan film, were made without any affiliation from Saban, and claim no rights to the characters. YouTube is now hosting a cleaner version of the video, while the original \"NSFW\" version is being hosted on Vimeo.\n\"Internet changes things.\"\n\"Hey internet, YOU WON,\" Power\/Rangers director Joseph Kahn writes  on Twitter . \"Saban has kindly and generously agreed to let us show POWER\/RANGERS!\"\nTHANK YOU to everyone who fought for free speech. You made a difference. Your voice was heard. Kind of nuts, right?\n\u2014 Joseph Kahn (@JosephKahn) February 28, 2015\nKahn tells Deadline that Saban wanted the disclaimers present so that kids wouldn't confuse his \"super-violent film\" with the decidedly friendlier Power Rangers show that they're used to. The short, produced by Adi Shankar and starring James Van Der Beek and Katee Sackhoff, went online late Monday and was viewed by around 12 million people on YouTube  before being pulled on Thursday in response to a copyright notice from Saban. The Vimeo version was pulled even sooner. The film was also hosted on Facebook \u2014 apparently the only platform that it never managed to get pulled from. It remains there without disclaimers.\n\"Internet changes things,\" Kahn  writes . \"New world, new rules.\"\nYoutube version POWER\/RANGERS back up now.
