{"Main text":"If we ran Amazon Studios, here are the shows we would make\nFive new shows enter, one (or, okay, maybe two) leave\n26 Comments\nToday, Amazon Studios posted a fresh batch of five TV pilots as part of its year-old, semi-crowdsourced production efforts. This third season, which includes two hour-long dramas and three half-hour comedies, indicates a stepping up on Amazon\u2019s part, particularly in terms of who\u2019s behind the camera: this time around, the roster includes Shaun Cassidy, creator of American Gothic, Marc Forster (World War Z), and Steven Soderbergh, who in his return from \u201Cretirement\" has really taken to the small screen .\nAs it\u2019s done before, Amazon Studios is soliciting feedback from the pilot\u2019s viewers and says it will use that input to decide which shows go on to produce full seasons \u2014 basically, a more transparent version of the big advantage companies like Amazon and Netflix have when it comes to measuring their users\u2019 interest in real-time. As Bill Carr, vice president of digital music and video, has said : \u201Cdata drives what we put in front of customers.\u201D\nSo what did the data fairy bring us this pilot season? Like most TV, a couple duds and some promising starts \u2014 and a bunch of callbacks to other popular shows, which is what you would expect when you make things based on other things people like.\nHere at The Verge, we\u2019ve collected some data of our own: and by data, we mean we watched all the pilots and had some opinions about which ones should go to season. See below for our picks \u2014 Hi, Amazon! More of Ron Pearlman\u2019s craggy forehead, please! \u2014 and our best guesses as to what the Great TV Algorithm picked up on that led to these shows.\nHand of God\nFeels like: Someone's been watching a lot of True Detective and True Blood.\nShould it get made? Absolutely, if it can manage to dig up a convincing female character or two.\nHand of God is everything great \u2014 and also completely terrible \u2014 about crime stories and revenge tales. The set is familiar: it has a sort of Southern Gothic thing going on, with big mansions, seedy restaurants, and a church that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s anywhere near God; something here is deeply, dearly wrong.\nThe pilot follows a judge, played by Sons of Anarchy\u2019s Ron Perlman, who breaks down and starts to believe that he\u2019s receiving messages from the divine beyond, and fairly violent messages, at that. The main character is basically a psychopath, but Perlman plays it a quiet, nervous way that\u2019s oddly captivating, even for how questionable his actions are.\nThat\u2019s good, because Hand of God starts out in a place that\u2019s over-the-top and hard to buy into \u2014 like, imagine if you were dumped into Breaking Bad right as a crazed late-season Walter White was speeding into the desert to dig up all his money. This show moves quick, and you\u2019d better catch up.\nThe show isn\u2019t just propelled by how devilish the judge\u2019s blood-soaked decisions are\nThat it throws everything it\u2019s got at you right away at first seems like a crutch, but that madcap nature turns out to be one of its greatest strengths. And you know what? The show isn\u2019t propelled by how devilish the judge\u2019s blood-soaked decisions are, but rather the judge\u2019s strange, childish conviction, even as everyone around him displays doubt.\nThat said, there are some serious issues that the show has to deal with if it does move forward. Most notable of those is its portrayal of women, who, in this first episode, are defined exclusively by their statuses as either victims or sex objects. It\u2019s pretty bad: one woman, inexplicably, grabs a guy\u2019s crotch in order to threaten him. This show is all about men \u2014 uncomfortably so \u2014 and it really needs to fix that. If there\u2019s one thing it shouldn\u2019t rip off from the occult southern dramas that came before it, it\u2019s the misogyny.\nStill, if any show is going to continue from this round of Amazon pilots, it should be this one. Hand of God manages to build a convincing world, set up a series worth of drama, and introduce a full cast of distinct characters. We\u2019re by no means sold on it being The Next Big Thing, but it\u2019s definitely the one with potential to grow the most.\nRed Oaks\nFeels like: Two parts Caddyshack, one part Dazed & Confused, with a sepia Instagram filter thrown on top.\nShould it get made? Yeah, sure. We dig tube sock.\nRed Oaks, directed by Sundance winner David Gordon Green and produced by Steven Soderbergh, follows a teenager (Craig Roberts) who rebels against his daddy by getting a job as an assistant tennis pro at the Red Oaks Country Club. They year is 1985. The place is Jersey.\nThe show feels exactly like the sum of its collaborators\u2019 parts, with an extra added dash of nudity and profanity (this is, after all, from the director of both Pineapple Express and Eastbound and Down). Compared to some of the other Amazon pilots in this round, the characters here are well-defined. It\u2019s not just that this pilot had us actually laughing \u2014 it\u2019s also that the world of Red Oaks is fleshed out (and well-shot) enough that we can see a full season\u2019s worth of potential material.\nHysteria\nFeels like: If they made a pilot-length DARE ads about the dangers of snorting GIFs, like the idea of the #hateread finally jumped to television\nShould it get made? Absolutely not, think of the children!\nA crack team of white girls stumble upon a freaky virus that causes one of their ranks to convulse wildly; naturally, someone films it, and obviously, it\u2019s transmitted through social media \u2014 and by \"social media,\" we mean what looks like an AIM client from 2000. Sure, the premise looks like it was originally inspired by a real news story but with these absurd caricatures of teens the show is actually too hysterical itself to watch.\nReally\nFeels like: The League, only without fantasy football or really any laughs. But there are married people in Chicago.\nShould it get made? Not really.\nWritten by, directed, and starring Jay Chandrasekhar (Beerfest, Super Troopers), Really is about four couples live in suburban Chicago \"trying to grasp onto their dwindling youth,\" according to Amazon Studios. It\u2019s a mishmash of themes that don\u2019t fit together: sometimes jokey, more often than not dark and uncomfortable. But it does have two Scrubs alum (Sarah Chalke and Travis Schmidt, who played her season five boyfriend Keith Dudemeister), so that\u2019s cool. And yes, people do occasionally say \"really?\" on the show.\nThe Cosmopolitans\nFeels like: Girls, but for guys.\nShould it get made? Whatever, sure. All of this will be gone one day, anyway.\nCosmopolitans is a show for wistfully romantic dudes who have always dreamed of traveling Europe and falling in and out of love and drinking a lot of wine and pretending to be Hemingway but never actually get close to doing anything like that. It has the right ideas (and often the right jokes), but the acting and directing here just can\u2019t keep up. It could get there\u2026 but it needs some work.\n","Title":"If we ran Amazon Studios, here are the shows we would make | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv-reviews"]}
