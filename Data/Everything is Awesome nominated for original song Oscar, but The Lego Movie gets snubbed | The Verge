{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe nominees for the 2015 Oscars were just announced , and while The Lego Movie picked up an original song nomination for the catchy and subversive \" Everything is Awesome ,\" the movie was conspicuously left off the list for animated feature film.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named five films as nominees for the award: Big Hero 6, The Boxtrolls, How to Train Your Dragon 2, Song of the Sea, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. The first three were also nominated for the Golden Globes' best animated feature film category (which Dragon won),Â but this time around Song of the Sea and Kaguya got the nods from the Academy instead of Lego and the Guillermo del Toro-produced The Book of Life.\nThe song was written by Mark Mothersbaugh, Tegan and Sara, and The Lonely Island. It's nominated alongside \"Glory\" (Selma), \"Grateful\" (Beyond the Lights), \"I'm Not Gonna Miss You\" (Glen Campbell: I'll be Me), and \"Lost Stars\" (Begin Again).\nThe animated feature film snub has already sparked enough of a reaction on Twitter that Lego writer and director Phil Lord has already tried to stamp the outrage while praising his team:\nThis is not a tragedy. Congrats to incredible crew and cast of The Lego Movie, who made a classic.\n","Title":"Everything is Awesome nominated for original song Oscar, but The Lego Movie gets snubbed | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
