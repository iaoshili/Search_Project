{"Main text":"Steven Spielberg will direct an adaptation of Roald Dahl's dark fantasy tale, 'The BFG'\nCan a little girl and a friendly giant stop the titans who are gobbling up children?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Bonecruncher. The Childchewer. The Meatdripper. The Fleshlumpeater. These are some of the names Steven Spielberg will try and bring to life when he  directs an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, The BFG . Dahl was know for injecting dark humor into children's tales, and this story is no exception. It's about a little girl who is kidnapped by a giant and taken to their kingdom. There she learns about a crew of terrible titans who periodically venture into the human world to snatch up and eat humans, especially little kids. Luckily her captor is the one Big Friendly Giant, and together they hatch a plan to try and stop his big brothers from killing again.\nA number of Dahl's books have become successful films, most notably Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, which featured some of his trademark sensibilities in the form of the violent yet laughable demise of several greedy children too eager to sample Mr. Wonka's inventive candies. For the BFG project, Variety reports , Spielberg is teaming up with Melissa Mathison, who last worked with him on E.T. That's a good sign for anyone hoping this adaptation won't pull any punches.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
