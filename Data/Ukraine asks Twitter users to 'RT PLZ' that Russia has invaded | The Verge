{"Main text":"Ukraine asks Twitter users to 'RT PLZ' that Russia has invaded\nThe account of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry also tweeted the hashtags #UkraineUnderAttack and #RussiaInvadedUkraine\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn March, the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea  seceded to Russia after a tense military standoff between the two countries. The situation continues to be hostile, and yesterday, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry tried using Twitter to rally support. This was the tweet, sent from a verified account:\n\u2014 MFA of Ukraine (@MFA_Ukraine) August 27, 2014\nThis week, after Russian paratroopers were apprehended in Ukraine, Russia said their presence was \" an accident ,\" and Vladimir Putin  continued to deny that his country had anything to do with arming separatists in Ukraine. Meanwhile, peace talks between the two countries are underway, and US diplomats have been  careful not to directly acknowledge an invasion.\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry doesn't have the same qualms. The call to \"RT PLZ\" apparently worked; the message has racked up more than 3,000 retweets as of writing.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
