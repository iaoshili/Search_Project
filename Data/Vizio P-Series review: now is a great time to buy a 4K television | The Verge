That sounds insane, but right now insanity is the best option for a TV shopper. I\u2019ve been testing the various ways TV manufacturers \u2014 especially Vizio \u2014 have been trying to deal with the madness. The most insane thing of all: it can actually work.\nWhen you go into your local Best Buy and look at the 4K TVs on display with their extreme saturation and brightness cranked up to sun-like levels, it\u2019s more important than ever to remember that when you get home, your TV will probably look nothing like that. It\u2019s not just the ridiculous settings the store uses; it\u2019s the 4K content itself.\nbuying a 4K TV isn\u2019t as easy as buying an HDTV\nMost of the 4K content playing on those TVs isn\u2019t being streamed \u2014 the way you will watch your 4K content for the foreseeable future \u2014  and is instead running off of a USB stick plugged into the back of the TV. Content playing off local storage will always look better than the same thing being streamed over the internet, and right now your only real options for local 4K playback involve ridiculous $300 boxes from Samsung or Sony. It all means buying a 4K TV isn\u2019t as easy as buying an HDTV, or any TV before it.\nThe good news is that most of those 4K TVs look great and are much cheaper than they used to be. In the last year, the price of 4K TVs has dropped dramatically \u2014 just like the price of HDTVs did over a decade ago \u2014 with top-tier manufacturers like LG, Samsung, and Vizio offering 4K TVs under $1,000. But when HDTVs became affordable in the mid-2000s, there was something to watch. There were Blu-rays and HD DVDs, and channels had already begun broadcasting in HD. Super Bowl XXXIV was broadcast in HD way back in 2000.\nThe 4K TVs are here, but the content isn\u2019t\nYears ago, when you brought your brand new HDTV home, there was a fully functioning ecosystem for you to plug into. That ecosystem doesn\u2019t exist for 4K TVs. Physical media isn\u2019t ready and channels won\u2019t broadcast in 4K for some time. Streaming services like Netflix \u2014 which has the best, albeit still limited, library of 4K content \u2014 and Amazon Prime Video are adding 4K content as fast as possible, but you could probably watch all the available 4K content on those services in two weeks if you were committed.\nEven so, you should still buy a 4K TV, because future-proofing is the name of the game. This isn\u2019t a phone or a tablet that you will replace in two to three years. TV sets are replaced every eight years in the US. Even with the slow progression of 4K content, physical media and channels will have their 4K content ready to go long before 2023 comes around. That means if you\u2019re looking to buy a new TV, 4K is the way to go. And right now one of the best options is Vizio\u2019s P-Series.\nWhen it comes to affordable, high-quality TVs, Vizio has been leading the way for some time, and the P-Series is no different. Starting at $799 for the 50-inch model and going all the way up to $2,499 for the 70-inch variation, the Vizio P-Series is one of the most affordable lines of 4K TVs on the market. I tested the 65-inch model, which will cost you $2,199 \u2014 a price that is still slightly unbelievable, given the sky-high price points of 4K TVs this time last year. Still, it has all of the features you would expect from a quality 4K TV: incredibly thin bezels, 5 HDMI ports, a 240Hz refresh rate, high-speed Wi-Fi (802.11ac), and the requisite Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu Plus apps.\nThe Vizio P-Series has all the features you would expect from a quality 4K TV\nThe picture quality on the P-Series is terrific \u2014 4K content looks amazing, with great color balance and good black levels. Where the P-Series falls flat is its user interface; Vizio\u2019s UI is awful. Compared to Samsung's and LG\u2019s WebOS-based UIs, Vizio\u2019s is borderline offensive. Aesthetically, it needs a ton of work, and its only saving grace is that you can jump directly into Netflix, Amazon, and iHeartRadio via dedicated buttons on the remote.\nAs good as local 4K looks on this Vizio, the real limiting factor on picture quality depends more on your internet connection than the actual panel. Netflix\u2019s 4K content worked well during our testing for the most part, but there were times when the stream of The Blacklist was reduced to 1080p. But thanks to the higher resolution of 4K TVs and the low resolution in which TV channels are still broadcast in, there\u2019s a new feature to consider: upscaling.\nVizio's upscaling engine is one of the best I've seen\nTo upscale HD content to 4K, a TV must double the pixels, replicating the data to form a seamless image. Manufacturers create their own upscaling engine using algorithms and processors to make their upscaled content distinct from the competition \u2014 usually with ridiculous names to go along with it (Sony has its 4K X-Reality PRO engine, while LG\u2019s upscaling engine is dubbed the Tru-4K Engine Pro) \u2014 and Vizio\u2019s Spatial Scaling Engine is one of the best 4K upscaling engines I\u2019ve seen so far.\nDetail and color reproduction were flawless when the P-Series upscaled 1080p content to 4K. We played 4K versions of The Blacklist and Breaking Bad, and then again in 1080p, and a number of Verge staffers couldn\u2019t tell the difference. That\u2019s not a common occurrence with 4K TVs, especially those in this price range. This is mostly due to the V6 six-core processor Vizio has put in the P-Series. It\u2019s a two-chip solution that powers the upscaling engine using a quad-core GPU and a dual-core CPU. Just like every other TV manufacturer who talks about their upscaling engine, Vizio says it is improving the picture as they upscale, but this time it\u2019s undeniably true.\n\"Our competition is trying to do this in a single chip, and when you try to do it in a single chip it becomes overwhelming, depending on the content and what you\u2019re trying to achieve in terms of picture,\" says James Kittle, an engineer at Vizio. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone with the two-chip combo, so we can make sure we\u2019re not just scaling, but we\u2019re also fine-tuning the picture quality as we do the upscale.\"\nESPN AND FOX STILL BROADCAST IN 720P\nAs someone who owns a 4K TV (a Samsung), I have personal experience with the benefits and pains of upscaling. For streaming 1080p content and for channels that are broadcast in 1080i like NBC, CBS, and HBO, upscaling is wonderful and can bring HD video nearly parallel with 4K content, but flaws like artifacts and ghosting still happen from time to time. While ghosting did occur a couple times while watching Netflix in 4K on the P-Series, those mistakes were fewer and further between, and they happened much less frequently than I\u2019ve seen on comparable 4K TVs in real-world use.\nBut when it comes to upscaling 720p content \u2014 which is still broadcast by FOX, ESPN, and ABC \u2014 to 4K levels, the flaws of upscaling engines from every manufacturer begin to really show themselves. When you upscale 720p content to 4K, it just doesn\u2019t look great. An argument could be made that 720p content looks better on 1080p TVs than on 4K TVs. And this isn\u2019t limited to Vizio \u2014 720p content doesn\u2019t look particularly great on 4K TVs made by any manufacturer. With ESPN and FOX still broadcasting in 720p, watching sports on your 4K TV can be less than spectacular.\nUpscaling Still has its faults\nLet\u2019s be clear, upscaled 720p content on a 4K TV still looks good. But when you\u2019re constantly switching between watching something in 4K and content upscaled from 720p, the drop-off is impossible to ignore. The transition from 480p to 1080p was a much bigger shift in picture quality, but by the time most people purchased HDTVs, channels were already broadcasting in HD, Blu-ray players were available, and game consoles could be played in HD. That isn\u2019t the case with 4K. The TVs are here, but the content isn\u2019t.\nEven in 2015, 4K TVs are still an investment, one that will net you a big return in the next couple years, as more content becomes available. But right now it\u2019s still a waiting game \u2014 waiting for the content, waiting for 4K Blu-rays to hit shelves, and waiting for channels to update their broadcast signals to the new 4K standards. But if you\u2019re tired of waiting, Vizio has built a TV that makes the transition period less painful.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"Vizio P-Series review: now is a great time to buy a 4K television | The Verge","Tags":["review","tech"]}
