{"Main text":"FDA may crack down on junk homeopathic 'remedies'\nHearings to reconsider policy the FDA has had since 1988\nThe FDA is spending  today and tomorrow asking for input on how to deal with homeopathic \"remedies,\" concoctions with no proof they work that haven't faced the scrutiny of regular medicine.\n\"There is little evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any specific condition.\"\nHomeopathy operates under the idea that heavily diluted substances in the body can trigger a response that fights disease, but most scientists have called the idea bunk. \"There is little evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any specific condition,\" the  NIH say , bluntly.\nStill, the FDA has allowed homeopathic remedies to be sold under a different set of rules than normal medicines. While prescription and over-the-counter drugs are approved before they're sold, the FDA  doesn't usually evaluate the safety or effectiveness of homeopathic remedies, and new regulations could endanger popular products sold in stores, like cold remedy Zicam,  Hyland's sleep aids , and various  supplements . The  CDC estimates that's a huge market: Americans spent $2.9 billion on homeopathic treatments in 2007.\nThe FDA hasn't reviewed that policy  since 1988 , but this week it's taking another look, asking for public comments \u2014 more than 1,100 have  piled up \u2014 and holding hearings from scientists and the homeopathy industry. The testimonies are already available, and split along predictable lines: homeopathy advocates attempting to argue that  only some products cause problems, while scientists point out the potential for confusion in the current system.\n\"Allowing homeopathic remedies to sit side by side with conventional drugs that have undergone FDA scrutiny as over\u2010the\u2010counter drugs is inherently misleading,\" Georgetown associate professor  Adriane Fugh\u2010Berman writes .\n","Title":"FDA may crack down on junk homeopathic 'remedies' | The Verge","Tags":["policy","science","us-world"]}
