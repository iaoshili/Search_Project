{"Main text":"Now's your chance to beam a message to aliens\nData will be transmitted to the New Horizons space probe studying Pluto\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNASA has greenlit an independent effort to upload a crowdsourced message from Earth to the New Horizons space probe, according to Space.com. The project was started by Jon Lomberg, who helped create the human time capsules carried on boardÂ  the Voyager spacecrafts.\nCrowdsourced message from Earth\nAccording to the New Horizons Message Initiative website , the missive will take a digital format, allowing it to be updated in the future if necessary. While the exact contents have yet to be determined, the final product may be comprised of images, sounds, 3D maps, and software. Space.com writes that Lomberg, NASA, and online voters are among those who will be responsible for curating the collated material. The results will eventually be streamed to the New Horizons probe once it has completed its study of Pluto and its adjacent satellites.\nHaving secured approval from NASA, the next step is to raise an estimated $500,000 through Kickstarter in order to fund expenses for the next three years. An official announcement about the project is scheduled for August 25th, and will contain submission guidelines.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
