{"Main text":"House surprises with vote to limit NSA spying capabilities\nNot law yet, but clear Congressional dissatisfaction with the NSA\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA proposal to block the NSA from using backdoor searches on US communications without warrants has been passed by the House of Representatives. The surprise vote, adopted 293-123, is an amendment to the 2015 Defense appropriations bill that would effectively prohibit the NSA from using funds to conduct warrantless searches. It\u2019s also designed to prevent the NSA from using its budget to force companies and organizations to add backdoors to encryption standards and products.\n\"Tonight, the House of Representatives took an important first step in reining in the NSA,\"Â  says Mark Rumold , staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"We applaud the House for taking this important first step, and we look forward to other elected officials standing up for our right to privacy.\" While there\u2019s clear support for the vote result, the amended bill still needs to be approved by the Senate, and for President Obama to sign the legislation before it becomes law. Regardless of the end result, the unexpected vote shows a clear level of Congressional dissatisfaction with the NSA, and could pave the way for similar amendments elsewhere.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
