{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat does it mean to be a celebrated designer? Is it being on the cover of Time Magazine , designing some of America's best-loved exports , or is it something as simple as being recognized with a Google Doodle? Raymond Loewy, one of the 20th century's most prolific and influential designers has now achieved all three, thanks to today's Google celebration of his 120th birthday. In the same spirit, we've compiled a few of Loewy's most memorable designs for you to peruse on this fifth day of November.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nAir Force One livery\nEvery time the US President takes off to faraway lands, he does so inside the Loewy-designed shell of Air Force One. The two complementary tones of blue and the Caslon typeface have remained undisturbed since the original design was put together for President Kennedy in the '60s.\nPRR S1 locomotive\nThough the defining characteristic of Loewy's legacy is the sheer breadth of his work, much of his early career was spent designing locomotives for outfits like the Pennsylvania Railroad company. That's what gives the 'PRR' designation to the PRR S1 steam train you see above.\n1963 Studebaker Avanti\nLoewy redesigned the Studebaker car company's logo and produced famed designs like the Starlight in the 1950s and this 1963 classic, the Avanti. The Studebaker Avanti was designed in a very short period of time by Loewy\u2019s hand-picked team of young designers, led by John Ebstein.
