{"Main text":"Google Maps now lets you tour Street View in virtual reality\nVisit the world with a piece of cardboard\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle turned its attention to virtual reality earlier this year with the  launch of its Cardboard do-it-yourself VR viewer , and now it\u2019s bringing functionality to Google Maps to support it. A new \"easter egg\" in Google Maps for Android allows Cardboard owners to activate VR in Street View and tour around cities worldwide. It\u2019s enabled after you double-tap the navigation circle in the lower right of the Google Maps app which then activates the side-by-side VR view.\nIf you\u2019ve not yet acquired Google Cardboard, you can fold your own or  buy a viewer kit from a variety of manufacturers. While it\u2019s just made of cardboard and uses an Android smartphone for the display, Google has shipped more than 500,000 units, suggesting that there\u2019s demand for the company\u2019s experiment. Google has even  introduced an SDK for developers , allowing them to easily create compatible Android apps.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
