{"Main text":"Microsoft reveals how it will make money giving away software\nIt's all about getting you hooked\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft has been doing some surprising things with software over the past year.  Free Windows and Windows Phone licenses for PC and phone makers, free Office for iOS and Android , and  acquisitions of free mobile apps all come to mind. While Microsoft has been praised for its bold moves, one question remains: how will Microsoft make money if it gives away software? The answer is freemium.\nMicrosoft\u2019s traditional revenue has primarily come from licensing software like Windows and Office to OEMs and businesses. Microsoft grew into the giant it is today thanks to this hugely successful strategy and a dominance of the PC market. With mobile altering the landscape, Microsoft is turning to new strategies for the future of its entire business. Speaking at Microsoft\u2019s Convergence conference today, Chris Caposella, who is in charge of marketing at the software giant, revealed Microsoft\u2019s freemium plans in full.\nFreemium is the way forward\nIt involves four parts: acquire, engage, enlist, and monetize. Acquire is Microsoft's way of getting people to use a product for free, like Office for iPad. Engage is Microsoft\u2019s plan to get them hooked on the product and leverage other parts of its ecosystem to keep someone using the service. Enlist is simply finding fans to keep the circle going, and then monetizing is figuring out who will pay for subscription versions of the service they\u2019re hooked on. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s something Microsoft hasn\u2019t traditionally succeeded at. Google has thrived at offering free services in return for your data or ads, but Microsoft\u2019s approach assumes people are willing to spend money on apps and services they\u2019re addicted to.\nCaposella\u2019s talk marks the first time Microsoft has clearly signalled exactly how it will rival Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. Former Microsoft CEO  Steve Ballmer hinted at it during his final months, but Caposella used an illustration of all three companies\u2019 greatest assets to show where Microsoft is focusing its efforts. \"If you look what Apple advertises on TV, at least in the US, it\u2019s all iPhone and iPad, and yet you see all the lines that connect their ecosystem,\" explains Caposella. \"So they can focus their marketing dollars on a very small number of things, be very disciplined, but because they\u2019ve engineered their things to work together one product naturally leads to the next product without any marketing at all. Very efficient marketing to build your marketing into your products.\"\nMicrosoft is taking an Apple approach to product integration\nIt\u2019s a technique that Microsoft has started to adopt, admits Caposella. Citing the Surface Pro 3 and its deep integration with OneNote, Microsoft has seen a big increase in OneNote usage. \"We had to convince the Windows team to work with the Surface team to work with the OneNote team,\" says Caposella, but the result was a product tied to Microsoft\u2019s strengths. Elsewhere, Cortana feeds into Bing to break the Google addiction. \"If you use Cortana, you\u2019re actually becoming a Bing user,\" explains Caposella. \"This is a way I can build Bing into every Windows phone, into every Windows 10 PC.\" While breaking the familiarity of using Google\u2019s website to search might be difficult, slowly spreading Cortana into apps and services across Microsoft\u2019s products will certainly help draw people away. Microsoft is using the same techniques for Outlook.com by integrating Skype in the hope you\u2019ll become a Skype user and they can then sell you minutes or subscriptions.\n\"We know consumers are choosing an ecosystem more than ever,\" admits Caposella, and it\u2019s this notion of an ecosystem that Microsoft really wants to improve. \"We don\u2019t have nearly the connectivity between our products that Apple has engineered, that Google has engineered.\" That\u2019s illustrated well in Microsoft\u2019s slide, and it\u2019s a good reminder that the company has a lot of work ahead of it to bring its products closer together. Windows 10 will obviously help a lot, and its primary purpose is unifying the apps, services, and the devices themselves on a single operating system. Windows 10 isn\u2019t the savior of Microsoft, though. It will certainly lay a foundation for better interconnectivity between Microsoft\u2019s apps and services across Windows, but as the company continues to focus on iOS and Android it will be looking to find every opportunity to break any addiction to Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s strong ecosystems.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Windows 10\n","Title":"Microsoft reveals how it will make money giving away software | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
