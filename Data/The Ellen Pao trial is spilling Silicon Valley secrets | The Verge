{"Main text":"Report\nThe Ellen Pao trial is spilling Silicon Valley secrets\nBillionaire John Doerr is testifying today, but the inner workings of his venture capital firm have already been exposed\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOpening arguments for Ellen Pao v. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers \u2014 the gender discrimination lawsuit that  cracked Silicon Valley\u2019s claim to meritocracy like an iPhone screen \u2014 began a week ago in San Francisco Superior Court. Entire afternoons of testimony have fixated on the  financial perks of being one of the (mostly male) senior partners at the celebrated venture capital firm, or the potential fivefold increase in income for (mostly male) \"managing members,\" who get to make decisions about a particular Kleiner fund and share in its profits.\nThat\u2019s just a peek at the cloistered habits of venture capitalists revealed in this trial. Normally, discussion of titles at venture firms is taboo. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a LinkedIn profile that admits to being a \"junior partner\" or a \"managing member.\" And the  \"team\" pages of top VC firms like Kleiner only obfuscate the issue. Are the female faces as powerful as the men in the head shots all around them? Probably not, but before Pao filed her industry-quaking lawsuit in 2012, the lack of women investors \u2014 at any pay grade \u2014 was rarely discussed.\nPao\u2019s case is often mistaken for a sexual harassment lawsuit. The complaint alleges that Kleiner retaliated against Pao because she reported being pressured into an affair by Ajit Nazre, a married coworker who had a \"strong influence\" on Kleiner partners. But Pao\u2019s short-term affair with Nazre in 2006 was consensual. He wasn\u2019t fired until another female junior partner reported unwanted sexual advances from Nazre. Pao, who is currently the interim CEO of Reddit, is suing for discrimination, alleging that Kleiner held back other women on the investing side based on gender. \nPao's case is often mistaken for a sexual harassment lawsuit\nShe is asking for $16 million in damages for lost wages and \"carried interest\" from profitable investments. Pao\u2019s attorney Alan Exelrod has described how Pao was excluded from business events and limited in the number of investments she could make each year. But performance reviews cite her lack of experience \u2014 the \" thousand tiny paper cuts \" familiar to any woman in the industry. Meanwhile, when Lynne Hermle, Kleiner\u2019s charismatic counsel, is asking the questions, it sounds like senior management liked every woman except Pao, who just couldn\u2019t cut it as a VC.\nBut gender bias is for the jury to decide. Regardless of the outcome, courtroom testimony has already helped expose the highly competitive and capricious process that determines which technologies and founders get funded, and who gets to get rich off the next Google, Amazon, Uber, or Snapchat (all Kleiner investments).\nThe trial is expected to last five weeks. Billionaire John Doerr, Kleiner\u2019s best known personal brand and a  father figure to Pao , is on the stand right now, and  Mary \"Queen of the Internet\" Meeker is still to come. Here\u2019s what we've learned so far.\nHow much venture capitalists get paid\nBefore she was fired (or \"transitioned out\") of Kleiner in 2012, Ellen Pao was making $560,000 a year, between her base salary ($400,000) and annual bonus ($160,000). It\u2019s but a fraction compared to her male peers whose take-home pay ballooned to  as much as five times that after they were promoted to senior partners and attached to one of Kleiner\u2019s funds as a \"managing member,\" an ownership role that allowed them to start receiving \"net fee\" income, or a share in profits.\nMen made up to five times more after being promoted\nOn the stand, Kleiner CFO Susan Biglieri, who has worked for the firm for 25 years, was asked by what multiple had compensation increased for three men after they were promoted: Amol Deshpande (Biglieri said four times; the judge interjected and said more like five times), Wen Hsieh (about three times), and Chi Hua-Chien (about four times). The implication is that Pao could have made as much $2.8 million a year. She worked at the firm for seven years. All three of those men were promoted in 2012, despite Pao\u2019s seniority. Like Pao, Hsieh had also started out in the \"chief of staff\" role, assisting Doerr.\nWhen Chien was on the stand, we also heard about a Kleiner-sponsored ski trip where employees and those associated were flown to Vail on a private jet and provided a dinner at Al Gore\u2019s condo at the St. Regis in San Francisco. Gore is  a partner at Kleiner . Pao, who was not invited, also lived at the hotel.\nReddit\u2019s valuation: less than you think\nTwo can play at the discovery game. Kleiner\u2019s lawyers used the trial as a reason to peek into Reddit\u2019s finances, arguing that the amount Pao stands to make from the so-called front page of the internet should offset damages, according to  The Wall Street Journal . Reddit, however, is not one of those billion-dollar unicorns trumpeting its valuation. Normally the bigger the company, the better, but Pao is more likely to win her $16 million if Reddit is perceived as being worth less. In a pretrial hearing, Kleiner\u2019s attorney pointed to the $500 million valuation reported as part of the $50 million Reddit raised in September from the likes of Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, as well as Jared Leto and Snoop Dogg. Pao\u2019s lawyers said an expert had valued the company about half that amount.\nThe identity of Nazre\u2019s other accuser\nKleiner fought hard to exclude other harassment complaints against Nazre, so it was a shock when former partner Trae Vassallo  took the stand on the first day of arguments to testify. An independent investigation found that Nazre had repeatedly crossed a line in his behavior towards Vassallo, but not Pao. (Both investigations were conducted in 2012 because Pao only formalized a complaint after she heard Vassallo went through a similar experience.)\nA surprise witness for the accuser\nThe first instance of harassment towards Vassallo was in 2009 when, she said, \"he started touching me with his leg under the table,\" during what was supposed to be a meeting to talk about Kleiner\u2019s green-tech investments.   During a business trip to New York, Nazre told Vassallo he was going to introduce her to an influential connection, but the restaurant reservations were for two, and the executive never materialized. Half an hour after dinner, Nazre showed up at her hotel room door in a bathrobe and slippers. Eventually, she was able to \"push him\" out of the door.\nVassallo also said general partner Ray Lane, a close and treasured mentor with whom she had an \"awesome\" relationship, told her she \"should be flattered.\" Lane denied saying that, telling Exelrod, \"It\u2019s just not me.\" But Stephen Hirschfeld, the lawyer who conducted the independent investigations, recalled Vassallo communicating something to that effect.\nHeld back from a promotion\nThe inclusion of her testimony is instructive not only because it establishes Nazre as a predator, who took advantage of Kleiner\u2019s inaction on Pao\u2019s complaints about retaliation, but also because Vassallo was clearly well-liked at the firm. Both Lane and Schlein spoke highly of her personality, where communicating with Pao made them bristle. Despite her promise and interpersonal skills, Vassallo was also held back from promotion to senior partner in 2011.\nDouble standards and extreme subjectivity\nKleiner laid out its plan to attack Pao\u2019s capabilities as an investor in the trial brief filed last month. According to the firm, Pao\u2019s electrical engineering degree from Princeton, a law degree and MBA from Harvard, and stints at a handful of tech companies did not give her the skills needed to be a good board member or help portfolio companies.  Much of the testimony has involved parsing Pao\u2019s performance reviews, which Exelrod maintains contained input from Nazre, even after she reported his retaliatory behavior.\nEven Mary Meeker had a hard time\nBut it\u2019s a powerful thing to hear that Mary Meeker and Aileen Lee, two of the best-known female venture capitalists, also had a tougher time getting promoted than their male counterparts at Kleiner. Lee, who founded a fund of her own called Cowboy Ventures in 2012, was never made a managing member at Kleiner. Yesterday, Exelrod produced a document from November 2011 indicating that Meeker was not initially a managing member on Kleiner\u2019s Digital Growth Fund, responsible for its investments in Spotify and Waze, despite the fact that she headed up the fund.\nJudge Harold Kahn allows jurors to submit questions when testimony is unclear, and they\u2019ve proven themselves to be exceedingly sharp, probing around the issue of how subjective perceptions of success can be at Kleiner.   One of yesterday\u2019s questions involved how carried interest is divided among partners. Kahn, who reads the jurors' questions, asked if \"any objectivity or mathematics\" were brought to bear when managing members divvy up carried interest. \"There\u2019s not some input to an equation,\" Schlein replied. It was hard not to think back to that when Lane, Nazre\u2019s mentor, explained why Nazre was allowed to stick around after initially lying to him about the affair with Pao. Months after he found out about the affair, Nazre was promoted to senior partner with Lane's support.\nWhen 'cocky' counts against you\nAnother question yesterday concerned Schlein\u2019s notes on a potential male hire from 2011 that seemed to imply the candidate\u2019s \"cockiness\" was an attribute. (Many of Pao\u2019s performance reviews called her arrogant and brash, noting her \"sharp elbows,\" where similar aggression in partners like Chien was not a cause for concern.) Schlein was asked to explain when cockiness is a good thing. \"If you\u2019re cocky and then by the time you\u2019re done talking to somebody and they don\u2019t like you,\" it\u2019s the wrong kind of cocky, he said.\nTestimony from his partners made it clear that Doerr was one of Pao's only supervisors who liked her, or had faith in her, but with his firm's reputation on the line, we'll see how much he is able to \"recall\" in court.\n","Title":"The Ellen Pao trial is spilling Silicon Valley secrets | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","report","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7972660"]}
