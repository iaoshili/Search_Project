{"Main text":"Lego minifigs drowned in arctic drilling incident\nGreenpeace twists \"The Lego Movie\" theme to protest arctic drilling\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGreenpeace is making an impassioned call for Lego to end its partnership with the oil giant Shell. In  a two-minute YouTube commercial , the environmental campaigners twist The Lego Movie's \"Everything is Awesome\" theme into a somber song, befitting for the on-screen events. The commercial depicts an idyllic Arctic scene, populated by polar bears and ice skaters, which is tarnished by a spillage created by the fictional Shell company's drilling, and even goes so far as to drown the movie's lead characters in oil.\nIt's a hugely effective spot, and is accompanied by  a Greenpeace microsite laying out the charity's issues with Shell's arctic drilling plans and Lego's involvement with the company. Greenpeace first began campaigning against Lego's partnership with Shell, which has been in place for many years, last month. Lego responded to the first wave of images saying it is \"saddened when the Lego brand is used as a tool in any dispute,\" and noting that it's \"determined to leave a positive impact on our society and children.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
