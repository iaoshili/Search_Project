{"Main text":"Panasonic's incredible cameraphone is coming to America, Leica lens and all\nThe Lumix CM1 is here to seriously up your photo game\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn September, Panasonic made waves at Photokina by using a camera show to announce a smartphone. But the Lumix CM1 isn\u2019t just any smartphone: it has a 1-inch sensor, the kind you\u2019d find in high-end point-and-shoot cameras, plus an f\/2.8 Leica lens that you\u2019d be lucky to find on a high-end point-and-shoot. Along with a 20-megapixel sensor, this phone is designed to basically reinvent the wheel when it comes to smartphone cameras.\nIt also has a 4.7-inch, 1080p display, a Snapdragon processor, Android 4.4, and 2GB of RAM. We liked it a lot at Photokina: it\u2019s fast, full of useful camera software, and surprisingly manageable in size given what\u2019s inside.\nThis is the kind of phone that never comes to America, the spec monster that companies make and sell internationally without trying to crack the complicated and saturated US market. But Panasonic just announced at its CES 2015 press conference that the Lumix CM1 is coming to our shores this summer.\nGizmodo reports that the CM1 will be sold unlocked, for $1,000, which means it would work on AT&T and T-Mobile. Those, of course, may not be the only deals. But either way, soon enough you too can be shooting with full manual controls and capturing 4K video on your phone \u2014 and sneering at everyone who\u2019s taking pictures on their lowly iPhones.\n","Title":"Panasonic's incredible cameraphone is coming to America, Leica lens and all | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech","ces-2015"]}
