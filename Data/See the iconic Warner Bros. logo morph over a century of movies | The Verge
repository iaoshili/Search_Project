{"Main text":"65 Comments\nFive years ago, designer Christian Annyas set out on a unique mission. He wanted to track the evolution of the Warner Bros. Pictures logo, starting with the some of the company's earliest films all the way through present day. It wasn't easy. \"I started in 2009 and have watched the first part (and trailers) of at least 1,000 Warner Bros. movies since,\" he told The Verge. The result is a brilliant look at a piece of branding that \u2014 like Universal's spinning globe and the mountains below Paramount's logo \u2014 became deeply ingrained in the minds of American moviegoers.\n\"During 90 years the Warner Bros. shield has undergone a series of refinements,\" reads the project's introduction. Many of those alterations came when the company fell under new ownership, which has happened numerous times during its storied history. But as you'll see below, Warner Bros. ultimately wound up not far from where it began. Hundreds of other examples can be seen at Annyas' website. As for why he did it, Annyas told The Verge, \"There wasn't a good overview of Warner Bros. logos yet.\" He added, \"I hate when the internet is incomplete.\"\nSpecial thanks to Christian Annyas for providing these high-res images.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThis logo was seen at the end of some of the earliest Warner Bros. films, including 1927's The Jazz Singer.\nEven back in 1938, the company was willing to modify its logo for artistic purposes.

Pictures was sold to control of the studio and its music business to Seven Arts Inc. in 1966, the logo went through a major redesign.\nHere the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts logo appears stylized ahead of 1969's Wild Bunch.\nThis bland logo resulted when Kinney Services bought Warner Bros. Pictures in 1970. It appears here before Dirty Harry.\nSaul Bass designed this logo \u2014 a favorite of many \u2014 which was used between 1972 and 1984.\nBy 1984's Gremlins, order had been restored and the logo reverted back to its classic style.\nSome custom logos were better than others. This version, for 2002's Scooby Doo, looks like an amateur Photoshop job.\nThings got better (and much darker) for Christopher Nolan's first Batman film, 2005's Batman Begins.\nThe custom logo used for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.\nChristopher Nolan yet again favored dark (and grayscale) for Inception.\nThe Losers may have been a mediocre film, but the WB emblem looked great in this comic styling.\n","Title":"See the iconic Warner Bros. logo morph over a century of movies | The Verge","Tags":["culture","design","entertainment"]}
