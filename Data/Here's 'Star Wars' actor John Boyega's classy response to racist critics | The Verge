{"Main text":"Here's 'Star Wars' actor John Boyega's classy response to racist critics\n'Get used to it. :)'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile we don't know the plot for the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens,  last week's debut trailer hinted strongly that John Boyega, i.e. \"the first person we see in the trailer,\" will have a leading role. Boyega happens to be wearing a stormtrooper suit in the teaser. He also happens to be black, which, oddly enough, has  unnerved some people who don't like the idea of black stormtroopers.\nIn a post  on Instagram this weekend, Boyega had this to say:\nA photo posted by @jboyega on\nNov 11, 2014 at 1:37pm PST\nClassy. As. Hell.\nThis is far from the first time fans have been in an uproar over casting black actors (Remember  Rue, Thresh, and Cinna from The Hunger Games ? Or  Michael B. Jordan as the Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot?). Thanks to the internet, it's especially, painfully obvious when these outcries happen. And as more Star Wars details come out \u2014 we still have more than year before The Force Awakens is released \u2014 there's bound to be more waves of angry sentiment.\nCan't we just focus on the things that actually matter?
