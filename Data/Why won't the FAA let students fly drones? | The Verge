{"Main text":"Report\nWhy won't the FAA let students fly drones?\nTeachers and model pilots are concerned a new government policy could ruin drones for the rest of us\nFrom the the Seattle Space Needle to a fireworks show in Florida to Martha Stewart\u2019s farm in upstate New York , it seems like small, privately-owned drones are popping up everywhere across America these days, providing us with previously unattainable, breathtaking aerial views. They\u2019re also causing trouble: crashing into heavily populated areas and flying uncomfortably close to hospitals and airports .\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration has  struggled for years with how to handle the growing popularity of these unmanned aircraft while keeping people safe, but the agency\u2019s latest attempt has raised the ire of an unusual group of critics: professors and model airplane pilots. As Paul Voss, an associate professor of engineering at Smith College who favors using small drones for teaching his students, tells The Verge: \"even though we as a group are very much respectful of government, things [at the FAA] are going way too far and harming our national interest.\" Last week, he and some 29 other academics from institutions including Harvard, Stanford, and Boston University,  submitted an open letter to the FAA outlining their complaints with a new policy the agency released last month.\nthings are going way too far and harming our national interest.\nVoss says there\u2019s no better way to learn about abstract concepts like aeronautics and fluid mechanics than by having students build and fly their own small drones. The FAA says in its new policy that it plans to regulate all small aircraft \u2014 from traditional remote-controlled model airplanes flown by hobbyists, to newer quadrocopters like the DJI Phantom and Parrot AR drones, which have some automation \u2014 by putting them into two main groups: those being used solely for recreational purposes (\"model aircraft\") and those being used for business purposes (\"commercial aircraft.\")\nA rubric from the FAA's Interpretation of Special Rule for Model Aircraft showing different use cases for model and commercial aircraft. (FAA)\nThe FAA says that pilots of model aircraft can fly them whenever and wherever they want, so long as they follow some common-sense safety guidelines (like not flying within five miles of an airport). All commercial aircraft pilots, though, first need to get permission with the FAA. As the agency wrote on its website: \"There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations. Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft\u2014manned or unmanned\u2014in US airspace needs some level of FAA approval.\" Those commercial pilots that don\u2019t get approval from the agency can face cease and desist orders and fines up to $10,000.\n\"You can\u2019t have the next \u2018Wright Brothers\u2019 if the only people who can get permits are established aviation folks.\"\nIt seems fairly cut and dried, but for academic institutions, the new FAA policy is a quagmire. \"We have students paying tuition,\" Voss points out, technically making any drones flown by professors or their students \"commercial\" and requiring FAA permission. So far, the FAA has only granted permission for commercial drone flights over land to a few select companies: dronemakers  AeroVironment and Boeing subsidiary Insitu , and the oil company  BP . Both Insitu and AerVironment also happen to sit on the FAA\u2019s rule-making committee for unmanned aircraft, raising the question of how much the new policy benefits them to the extent of incumbents. \"There\u2019s no space for innovation, no space to try something out if everyone needs a permit,\" Voss says. \"You can\u2019t have the next \u2018Wright Brothers\u2019 if the only people who can get permits are established aviation folks.\"\nModel airplane pilots agree that the FAA\u2019s language could hamper learning in classrooms at all levels. \"Model aircraft have been used as a teaching tool in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] curriculum for decades,\" says Richard Hanson, a spokesperson for the Academy of Model Aeronautics , a large nonprofit dedicated to recreational model aircraft. He said his organization pushed the FAA to include an educational exception in its new policy, but that the agency declined.\n\"aircraft must be visible at all times to the operator.\"\nIn a further point of contention, the FAA\u2019s new policy states that if a pilot uses only \"first person view\" to control their drone or model aircraft \u2014 looking at a video feed from the drone\u2019s frontal camera displayed on a smartphone, tablet, or goggles, as is common with many drones and model aircraft \u2014 it automatically becomes commercial, even if the pilot isn\u2019t getting paid. As the FAA\u2019s policy states, model \"aircraft must be visible at all times to the operator.\" So if you\u2019re flying your Parrot AR drone for fun and you can still see it with your eyes, it\u2019s considered a model aircraft and you don\u2019t need FAA permission. But as soon as the drone turns a corner and you\u2019re flying it only with the smartphone view, it\u2019s now a commercial aircraft and you need FAA approval.\nNot surprisingly, model airplane pilots seem to be largely against the FAA\u2019s new policy. Among the 1,600 public comments submitted to the FAA about its new proposal are hundreds from model aircraft pilots complaining about first-person view being effectively banned.\nMost problematically for Voss is the idea that the FAA\u2019s policy states the agency can take action against any aircraft that threatens the \"national airspace\" \u2014 even model aircraft \u2014 and that the agency seems to have an incredibly broad definition for what is considered national airspace.\nAs Voss points out in the letter he sent to the FAA last week: \"The [national airspace] is a term that the FAA now implies comprises all airspace in the United States, including our campuses, private backyards, and possibly even inside buildings.\" Attached to his letter is one the FAA sent to TornadoVideos.net in 2011, demanding the organization cease its use of drones, even over private property, until it received FAA clearance.\n\"There are pretty serious legal implications when we invite the FAA to preemptively take control of backyards,\" Voss says, later telling The Verge via email: \"Everyone from Google to the backyard inventor should be paying attention \u2014 once the FAA's new view of our property gets locked in, it will be difficult if not impossible to fix.\" The FAA recently extended its comment period on its new policy to late September.
