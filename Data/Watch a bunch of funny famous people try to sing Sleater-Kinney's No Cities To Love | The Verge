{"Main text":"Watch a bunch of funny famous people try to sing Sleater-Kinney's No Cities To Love\nFred Armisen, Andy Samberg, Sarah Silverman, and more do Photo Booth karaoke\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNext week, Portland punks  Sleater-Kinney will return with their first record in a decade, No Cities To Love, on Seattle label  Sub Pop . The band dropped a video for the album's title track today, and it's a doozy. For the clip, Sleater-Kinney recruited an impressive lineup of famous and kind-of-famous friends to sing along to the half-snarled track. Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis we expected, but Sarah Silverman and her dog?\nShot largely in grainy selfie form, the video features hard-to-forget images like Fred Armisen playing a keyboard on the sidewalk, My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way looking like your angsty teen brother, Andy Samberg nodding his head distractedly, and Miranda July dancing like she invented quirk.
