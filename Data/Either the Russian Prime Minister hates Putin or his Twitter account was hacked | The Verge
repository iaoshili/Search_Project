{"Main text":"Either the Russian Prime Minister hates Putin or his Twitter account was hacked\nDmitry Medvedev tweeted that he was 'ashamed of the actions of the government'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe  Russian-language Twitter account of the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, was apparently hacked today. The official account, verified and followed by 2.5 million people, posted a tweet in Russian at 2:21 AM ET that read \" I am resigning. Ashamed of the actions of the government. I'm sorry.\"\nThe tweet was followed by a series of 140-character criticisms of the Russian regime, in addition to retweets from  prominent anti-Putin journalists , writers, and thinkers. One of the tweets, now deleted, read \"I like reading  @Navalny \" in English \u2014 a reference to the Yale-educated lawyer and activist Alexei Navalny.  The Wall Street Journal has called Navalny \"the man Vladimir Putin fears most.\"\nAround 40 minutes after the first tweets appeared from the hacker, they were deleted. It's not yet clear who was behind the apparent breach.\nUpdate August 14th, 3:05AM: The hacker's tweets have now been deleted.
