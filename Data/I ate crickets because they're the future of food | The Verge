{"Main text":"I ate crickets because they're the future of food\nThis Canadian farm wants to put crickets in your kitchen\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe morning after I visited Next Millennium Farms, my digestive system expelled its first cricket exoskeleton. There it was, floating on the water\u2019s edge of my hotel room toilet: a translucent thoracic shell with three legs still attached. Presumably, the others got lost in the gastrointestinal shuffle, but I didn\u2019t look long enough to try and spot them, or any of this particular insect\u2019s friends and relatives. I had been eating a lot of them.\nNext Millennium Farms (NMF), located about 90 minutes outside of Toronto, Ontario, is part of a movement to introduce crickets \u2014 fried, baked, or milled into flour \u2014 to the North American menu. The insect\u2019s nutritional benefits, combined with mounting concerns over the environmental impacts of meat production, is prompting conscious food producers to see the pest in a new light, turning cricket meal into everything from protein bars to cookies.\nLaunched in late 2013 by three brothers \u2014 Jarrod, Darren, and Ryan Goldin \u2014 NMF is a major supplier of cricket flour, which Jarred describes as \"floured meat.\" \"It\u2019s chock-full of protein, has more iron than spinach, as much calcium as milk, all the amino acids, tons of omega 3, and tons of B12,\" he says. \"So not only does it taste good, it\u2019s also unbelievably healthy.\" The company expects to ship 3,000 pounds of flour in September alone; by year\u2019s end, they predict that figure will rise to 10,000 pounds a month. \"We\u2019re having fun and this [growth] is all awesome,\" Jarrod says, \"but the amazing thing is that it\u2019s not compromising nature \u2014 or taste.\"\nI\u2019m standing with Jarrod and Darren in front of Reptile Feeders , the Goldins\u2019 original pet-food business and the first stop in my daylong tour of NMF. The company also sells a line of edible worm snacks, and those worms are currently housed in the same facility as the insects, rodents, and pythons being bred for pet shops. Darren and Ryan\u2019s love of snakes is how the Goldins got involved with crickets in the first place, Jarrod says. \"They realized that you can sell a snake to somebody once, but if you also sell insects, they\u2019ll come back to you every week.\"\nThe two brothers founded Reptile Feeders six years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until 2013 that Jarrod quit his job as a chiropractor to join them in a new venture to push insects as food for people. \"The UN came out with documents on insects for food and feed security,\" Jarrod explains. \"I looked at it and I said, \u2018Maybe this is finally the right thing [for us.]\u2019\" A few weeks later, The Clinton Global Initiative gave a $1 million grant to Aspire, a McGill University project aimed at bringing insect farming to the developing world. \"I called my brother Darren and said, \u2018This is bullshit, we know more about insect farming than anyone, and we should get this going.\u2019\"\n\"Not only does it taste good, it\u2019s also unbelievably healthy.\"\nAfter a tour of Reptile Feeders, we drive over to the cricket farm, a 9,000-square-foot warehouse about 20 minutes away. The building\u2019s huge doors have been thrown open, so we can hear the chirping as we approach. The inside is clean and brightly lit. Inside, two employees are piling large plastic containers of live crickets atop one another. One of the meat grinders\u2019 motors blew out, Darren explains, so they haven\u2019t been able to grind crickets into flour at their usual pace. They\u2019re keeping them alive in the meantime, because the crickets are always ground up shortly after they\u2019re dead.\nBeyond the plastic containers lie the wooden cricket bins. These open-air containers house the crickets that aren\u2019t ready to be turned into flour yet. Each is equipped with an automated system that provides hydration and food. Inside the bins are two rows of elevated \"cricket condos\" \u2014 egg cartons stuck together and stacked vertically. According to Jarrod, each bin holds between 70 and 100 pounds of crickets. He estimates that the entire facility houses well over 30 million crickets at any given time.\n\"We want to remove all the dead and unhealthy crickets from the mix of crickets before we cook them,\" Darren says as he demonstrates the harvesting process. This consists of grabbing one of the cricket condos and shaking the insects vigorously into a large plastic tub. Many of them jump out. Then, Darren drops the condo back into the tub for a few seconds, and the young and sprightly crickets jump back onto the condo. Those that aren\u2019t quick enough are removed.\n\"We do this three times,\" Darren explains, so by the third condo-shaking, only the liveliest of insects remain. \"I don\u2019t think it makes a difference nutritionally,\" Jarrod adds, \"but the optics are important.\"\nOnce the crickets are gathered, an employee euthanizes them using carbon dioxide. After that, they\u2019re transported to the processing facility, a townhouse about 30 minutes away. We stop by as Derek Delahaye, NMF\u2019s cook and product facility manager, is rinsing one batch of dead crickets with warm water, and baking another at 230 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours. Meanwhile, a blond-haired man wearing gloves and a hair net shakes freshly baked crickets out of a plastic tupperware and into meat grinders in an adjacent room. It\u2019s crunch time: the Goldin brothers are filling a big order for Exo , a company that manufactures protein bars with NMF\u2019s flour and currently sells 50,000 bars a month.\n\"It tastes strong and distinctly meaty, and it has a sandy texture.\"\nJarrod doesn\u2019t have any Exo bars on hand, but he does have a plethora of insects for me to try. First, he opens a bag of plain baked wax worms and lays them on a table. They taste like chicken skin, or maybe roasted chickpeas. Next up are honey-mustard crickets. They\u2019re crispy like bacon, and the seasoning is a nice touch. Finally, I try the cricket flour. It tastes strong and distinctly meaty, and it has a sandy texture. Still, it could definitely be mixed with conventional flour and concealed in a baked good.\nAccording to Jarrod, that\u2019s how most customers use it. Companies like Exo and Mark Cuban-backed Chapul use NMF\u2019s flour to make protein bars, while Six Foods is using it to make \"chirps\" (cricket-infused tortilla chips), and Bitty Foods produces cookies and a custom flour blend for home baking. NMF\u2019s goal is to capitalize on the nutritional content of cricket flour \u2014 and for the most part they have \u2014 but there\u2019s one unexpected issue that\u2019s been holding them back: the product\u2019s name.\n\"The industry made the initial mistake of labeling it as flour,\" Darren says. And \"it\u2019s very hard to take back.\" A single pound of cricket flour contains 317 grams of protein and costs $40 online, making it more akin (in nutritional content and price) to protein powder than baking flour. Yet the fact that previous manufacturers chose to label it as \"flour\" years ago means that people \u2014 reporters from The New York Times, for example \u2014 tend to compare its cost to plain white flour. \"It\u2019s like saying well, compared to a Honda Civic, a Ferrari is expensive!\" Jarrod says. \"Well it is! But how can you compare those two cars?\"\nTo counter this issue, the Goldins have decided to make their product even more specialized. They\u2019ve just launched a line of gluten-free crickets, that are fed grains like rice and corn instead of wheat, and have plans for a Paleo line. An organic certification is also on the horizon \u2014 but because of a convoluted regulatory process, the crickets\u2019 feces have been certified organic and the company is now waiting on certification for the crickets themselves.\nThe crickets are always ground up shortly after they\u2019re dead\nStill, the red tape that surrounds selling crickets for human consumption hasn\u2019t been overwhelming. Once the brothers got a permit to import a new species of cricket \u2014 the tropical house cricket, which is resistant to a virus that can decimate entire cricket farms \u2014 they were essentially cleared for business by the Canadian government (\"they can\u2019t [survive the winter] in Canada,\" Jarrod explains, so there\u2019s no danger of them becoming an invasive species). The US has been equally lax, allowing the company to operate under GRAS self-determination , an FDA regulation that allows qualified outside experts, like those who authored the UN report on edible insects, to determine if a product is safe, instead of going through government officials.\nWhen you think about it, Jarrod says, this makes perfect sense. More than a quarter of the entire human population eats insects on a regular basis, he says, so \"it\u2019s not a novel food.\" The Western world has chosen to pass on eating insects for the past few hundred years, and it\u2019s the Goldins\u2019 plan to bring them back.\nAs I bring one to my mouth, I see an insect leg poking out of the corn tortilla\nIt\u2019s almost 4PM and we haven\u2019t had lunch yet, so Jarrod and Darren take me to a Mexican restaurant called La Hacienda close to NMF\u2019s facility where NMF\u2019s crickets are used in one of the taco dishes.\n\"When we started NMF, I really intended to position this as a carbon-footprint company,\" Jarrod says. But potential customers were more interested in nutrition than the environment. \"How could we be so naive to think that people would care more about the environment than themselves?\" These days, the company promotes the flour\u2019s vitamin and amino acid content instead. The hook doesn\u2019t really matter to Jarrod, as long as people start thinking about protein differently.\nAs we chat, I glance at the \"tacos de grillos\" sitting in the middle of the table. For the first time today, my stomach churns. As I bring one to my mouth, I see an insect leg poking out of the corn tortilla. \"It\u2019s good,\" I tell Jarrod and Darren, and I\u2019m not lying. But I\u2019d prefer to only eat one.\n\"People come here just for the cricket tacos, and they like it!\" says our server, Rosa, as she clears our plates. \"They say it tastes like chips.\" To me, the crickets\u2019 distinctly meaty flavor is more like bacon, and I ask if she\u2019s sampled them. \"You know, I work here, and you have to try it so you can tell the customer what it tastes like,\" she explains, her face now impassive. \"Eating them isn\u2019t the end of the world.\"\nJarrod smiles through the exchange, and nods when she leaves. He knows he can\u2019t convince everyone that eating insects makes sense, but there are enough people out there already intrigued. \"We literally can\u2019t produce and grow fast enough to meet the demands of the people who are interested,\" he says, \"so we aren\u2019t considering the people that aren\u2019t.\"\n\"People come here just for the cricket tacos, and they like it!\"\nSince their initial investment round \u2014 a single investor (who requests anonymity) gave them $50,000 in exchange for a 5 percent share in the company \u2014 NMF has grown at a tremendous pace. That shouldn\u2019t be surprising, given the lack of competition: Jarrod is aware of only two other cricket-flour companies in North America, World Ento and All Things Bugs , and they use leftover breeder crickets from reptile feeders rather than crickets reared specifically for humans. \"There\u2019s no controlling which crickets go into the mix, or what they\u2019re eating,\" he notes, so NMF\u2019s product tends to win out with companies who want to make sure their ingredients are safe.\nCompetition will come at some point ( a farm in Ohio has plans to start shipping dried crickets raised for human consumption this fall), but for now the Goldins are basking in their head start. In five years, Jarrod says, he\u2019d like to see NMF open farms internationally. \"One day,\" he says, \"we\u2019ll walk by people at restaurants who are eating steaks, and we\u2019ll give them a bad eye.\"\nPhotos by Daniel Ehrenworth\n","Title":"I ate crickets because they're the future of food | The Verge","Tags":["culture","features","science","longform"]}
