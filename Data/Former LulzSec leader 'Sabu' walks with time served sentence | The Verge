{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHector Xavier Monsegur, better known as former top LulzSec leader \"Sabu,\" will now go free. US District Court Judge Loretta Preska sentenced Monsegur to time served plus one year of supervised release, praising his work with the FBI to disrupt hundreds of cyberattacks orchestrated by LulzSec and Anonymous over the past three years.\nA reward for extraordinary cooperation\nMonsegur, an online celebrity in his heyday, was arrested by the FBI in June of 2011, and worked as an informant from that point on. The information he provided on LulzSec was instrumental in bringing down  such hackers as Jeremy Hammond , who is currently serving 10 years in prison for leaking documents to WikiLeaks. Despite facing a 26-year sentence,  the government recommended this weekend that he be sentenced to the seven months he'd already served in pre-trial custody \u2014 a reward for the \"extraordinary\" cooperation he provided as an informant.\n\"Over the last three years I\u2019ve gone through a lot of changes and learned a lot of lessons,\" he said in a prepared statement. \"I've done a lot of soul searching.\"\nThe freed Monsegur must now face the notoriety he received after being publicly identified as an FBI collaborator. Since that time, he and his family have received threats from a hacker community that feels betrayed by his actions. In addition, it remains unclear how involved the FBI was in  attacks on government websites Sabu directed while under their watch.\n","Title":"Former LulzSec leader 'Sabu' walks with time served sentence | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
