{"Main text":"Tesla's Roadster is getting an upgrade to nearly double its range\nSan Francisco to Los Angeles on a single charge\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the company\u2019s Roadster model is getting a battery upgrade to extend its range from 244 miles to almost 400 miles. It's a significant boost, and one that means the Roadster will be able to outdo even the company\u2019s flagship Model S, which has a range of 265 miles.\nIntroduced in 2008, the Roadster was Tesla's first production vehicle, and though it has been overshadowed somewhat by the newer Model S, the company has been  teasing a major upgrade for it since June this year . Musk and company are now rewarding the roughly 2,500 early adopters who bought into Tesla's vision of the electric car years before it became so widely accepted. The upgrade is expected to come in the form of a full battery replacement, though full details won't be available until later today. Musk also goes on to say that a similar upgrade is \" not coming soon \" for the Model S, but will happen eventually.\nRoadster upgrade will enable non-stop travel from LA to SF -- almost 400 mile range.
