{"Main text":"FCC may change rules that gave Dish $3 billion in small business discounts\nChairman Tom Wheeler circulated a call for comments on a new system\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEarlier this year, the FCC took in $44.9 billion in bids through  a wireless spectrum auction , as the wireless industry's biggest companies battled it out for airwave licenses. But quickly, some of that money proved controversial: FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai  accused Dish Network of manipulating small business discounts, paying $3 billion less in the auction than it would have otherwise.\nToday, the FCC took early steps toward changing that. Chairman Tom Wheeler has circulated a \"public notice\" asking for comments from other FCC commissioners on possible reforms to the system,  Reuters reports . Dish took the $3 billion by operating through small shell companies that it's invested in, and the proposals would theoretically prevent that from happening again, confining the discounts only to up-start companies hoping to compete with big telecoms.\nThe rules could still be a long while from changing, but as Reuters reports, the FCC is currently reviewing Dish's discounts.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
