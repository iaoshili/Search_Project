{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf it's an April Fools' joke, it's a badly timed one. Yesterday, Top Gear's UK website updated the top banner to remove all three presenters and replace them  instead with a \"Super Stig\" \u2014 or rather a nondescript driver in a very reflective helmet.\nHere's what it looked like on March 28th , vs. how it looks right now:\nJeremy Clarkson's removal is to be expected, given that  he is officially off Top Gear , but cohosts James May and Richard Hammond have been less clear. On the day Clarkson was let go (or rather, his contract was not renewed), May told Sky News, \"As much as I think he's a knob, I quite like working with Jeremy.\" The same day, both he and Clarkson  updated their Twitter profiles to indicate being former presenters; Hammond updated his with the more vague, \"Can't explain it really ... er, I do this car show and stuff.\" The trio's columns are still being promoted farther down the page.\nThe only real update since then comes from the \"clarkhammay\" Instagram account (which looks like it used to be the Top Gear Live account ) announcing \"Clarkson, Hammond & May Live.\"\nA photo posted by Clarkson, Hammond & May Live (@clarkhammaylive) on\nApr 2, 2015 at 7:37am PDT\nThe three have long done live shows under the \"Top Gear Live\" banner. On Tuesday, BBC announced that this \"TGL\" tour would continue without the Top Gear name . What that means for Top Gear itself is still officially up the air. Unofficially, though? It seems like Hammond and May won't be renweing their contracts, either.\nMaybe \"Super Stig\" really is the new host.\nVox Video: Riding in a 3D printed car\n","Title":"Top Gear's website has removed all three hosts from the top banner | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","transportation","tv"]}
