{"Main text":"Orange is the New Black can't compete for a comedy Emmy\nThe Netflix show is considered a 'drama'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix's popular prison show Orange is the New Black won't be taking home any comedy Emmys this year. That's because the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Industry Panel ruled today that Orange doesn't qualify as a comedy,  The Wrap reports . It will instead compete in the \"drama\" category.\nHow dramatic\nThe decision is an unexpected one, because the show competed as a comedy at the 2014 Emmys, with Uzo Aduba, aka \"Crazy Eyes,\" taking home an award for best guest actress in a comedy series. Last month, the Television Academy  attempted to change the definition of a comedy, saying that shows needed to cap out at 30 minutes to qualify. But the hour-long shows Shameless and Glee will both compete in the comedy category this year.\n\"While we\u2019re disappointed in the committee\u2019s decision, we believe that Orange represents the best of television in either category,\" Netflix Chief Content Office Ted Sarandos told  The Hollywood Reporter .\nThe Emmys are scheduled to take place on September 20th, 2015. And whatever happens to OITNB there, a third season is definitely happening .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
