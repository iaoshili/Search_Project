{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPanasonic is getting in on the selfie-first trend with the new mass-market Lumix GF7 \u2014 a 16-megapixel interchangeable lens camera which comes with a flippable LCD monitor, secondary left-hand shutter button, and a hands-free mode that shoots when the subject waves.\nThe GF7 is the latest Panasonic to use the Micro Four Thirds sensor (indeed, it\u2019s got the same sensor and Venus processing engine as the earlier Lumix GX7) and is set to go on sale in March this year for $599 (Â£429). Panasonic is still aiming at the dedicated amateur with this camera, although the traditional stylings and leather-touch grip are definitely a step up in terms of style from the previous plastic-molded GF6 line. The GF7 is also available in a range of colors (black, brown, pink, and orange), although these appear to be region-specific.\nUnfortunately, the GF7 hasn\u2019t made the leap to shooting 4K video, but records at a respectable 1920 x 1080 Full HD resolution. There\u2019s also 5.8fps burst shooting and a standard 12-35mm f\/3.5-5.6 kit lens. Oh, and, if you thought Panasonic hadn\u2019t put enough thought into the selfie theme, there\u2019s also a range of software features including Jump Snap (where the camera automatically takes a picture at the highest point of a jump), a password-less Wi-Fi syncing option to send snaps to your phone, and a vanity-inducing range of \u201Cbeauty\u201D filters.\nJudging by the spec sheet alone, the GF7 looks to be a solid camera but its stand-out features are far from unique \u2014especially when the likes of the Fujifilm X-A2 offers pretty much the same package (flippable screen, interchangeable lens, classic stylings) for $50 less. We'll have to wait for a selfie-off to crown the real winner.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Panasonic's mirrorless Lumix GF7 is a $600 selfie shooter | The Verge","Tags":["photography","tech"]}
