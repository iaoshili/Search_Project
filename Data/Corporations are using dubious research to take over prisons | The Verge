{"Main text":"Corporations are using dubious research to take over prisons\nHow companies funded research supporting the privatization of prisons\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSince the mid-1980s, private companies have contracted with states and branches of the federal government to assume certain prison operations. The argument behind these contracts has been that private companies \u2014 which are not beholden to things like pension arrangements with correctional officer\u2019s unions \u2014 can cut prison spending in ways that governments can not.\nFor the most part, this argument was theoretical \u2014 an idea never definitively proven by any significant academic studies (though some have tried to do so ). But then, in April 2013, came a study out of Temple University in Philadelphia. This study found that private prison companies could help governments cut costs from between 12.46 percent and 58.61 percent. It looked like a groundbreaking study on its surface, and the private prison industry ran with it. But recently that appearance has begun to fade and reveal a very different picture: that of corporate prisons taking a page out of Big Tobacco's playbook.\nPrivate prison companies were doing well enough without the academic boost. Though these companies only oversee about 8 percent of United States prisons , the number of prisoners in private facilities rose by 37 percent between 2002 and 2009, and the companies generally make a lot of money: Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the largest private prison company in the world, has a market cap of $3.74 billion ; one of its competitors, the GEO Group, has a market cap of $2.46 billion . But the study was nonetheless helpful; it backed up the savings claims with an ostensibly independent study from a reputable academic institution. It brought private prisons \u2014 and the contracts those companies were lobbying to secure with states and the federal government \u2014 into policy discussions all over the country. The study\u2019s authors, Temple economics professors Simon Hakim and Erwin A. Blackstone, even wrote op-eds in newspapers where private prisons were being considered by lawmakers. This was all excellent news for private prison companies.\n\"The study received funding by members of the private corrections industry.\"\nSoon after, however, the study\u2019s findings began to look a little less excellent.\nPrivate prison companies have an enemy in a man named Alex Friedmann. He\u2019s a former CCA prisoner and editor of Prison Legal News who has devoted a significant portion of his post-prison life to pointing out the faults in private prisons. He\u2019s aligned with unions \u2014 which are opposed to private prison companies \u2014 and he argues that, by cutting costs, these companies put the welfare of prisoners in jeopardy.\nWhen the Temple study was released, he noticed the very last line in a press release that went along with it : \"The study received funding by members of the private corrections industry.\"\nFriedmann wondered: how could the study be independent if it received funding from private prison companies? The press release had made it clear that these companies had helped pay for the study, but the original study itself did not. He wrote about his concerns in op-eds, often responding directly to op-eds written by professors Hakim and Blackstone. He filed an ethics complaint in May 2013 with Temple University alleging that the professors \"breached their ethical responsibilities\" by not disclosing their funding sources. In the meantime, members of the private prison industry continued to tout the study\u2019s findings.\nThen last month, the ACLU got involved, publishing an open letter to private prison companies outlining the study\u2019s faults and \" astonishingly misleading \" conclusions. By mid-July, Temple finally made an announcement. It was distancing itself from the study : \"Temple didn\u2019t receive any grant funds for this work, and we don\u2019t endorse or interfere with faculty when they conduct independent research \u2014 their work is their own. It\u2019s not a Temple University study, it\u2019s the work of the professors.\"\nThis reaction from Temple isn\u2019t uncommon, says Vickie J. Williams, a law professor at Gonzaga University who has written about private funding concerns in health studies . She told me told me that corporations fund studies frequently. It happens in health care all the time. But there are expectations about how to ensure that privately funded research is sufficiently scrutinized. Peer review \u2014 where academic studies are put in front of reputable scholars who pick apart those studies and then publish notable work in academic journals \u2014 is a way to do that. The Temple study was not peer reviewed before its public release last April. Williams thus compared it to research funded by tobacco companies. \"Tobacco companies sponsored a great deal of biomedical research involving tobacco,\" she told me. \"And of course the fact that they had the power to suppress or skew the results of that research lead to a great many lawsuits.\"\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess whether lawsuits will befall private prison companies in the wake of Temple\u2019s study. In the meantime, the controversy continues. The Independent Institute, a libertarian think-tank, published the Temple study in June . Friedmann is \"putting together a faculty sign-on letter to Temple requesting that the school adopt a formal policy regarding disclosure of funding sources of academic research,\" he wrote me in an email. And a CCA representative denies the worries over the Temple study amount to anything significant at all: \"To date, no one has pushed back on or taken to task the findings, or the validity of the research,\" the representative  told Inside Higher Ed .\nThat last part isn\u2019t exactly true. The ACLU\u2019s open letter disputes a number of the study\u2019s findings. And I\u2019ll offer another as an example:\nThe Temple study's findings in Arizona go against even what Arizona's own state legislature found about prison costs . Arizona's legislature found that private prisons didn't result in a significant cost savings, while the Temple study found the opposite. Why the discrepancy? Among the reasons why the Temple study disagreed is that the \"state provides all the required medical care at selected [Arizona] prisons, while private contractors have limits on the care they are required to provide.\" Which means, in short, that the Temple academics chose not to take into account the costs of prisoner medical care in private prisons. That\u2019s a major omission.\nThe study didn't take into account the costs of prisoner medical care in private prisons.\nRegardless, I can\u2019t help but think the study\u2019s existence \u2014 and the debates over its funding, its veracity, and its findings \u2014 are good. The study itself attempts to justify a system with an argument. That argument may be a purchased. It may be flawed. But at least it\u2019s there as a point of discussion.\nThis discussion \u2014 about private prisons in this case, but more broadly about the state of our prison system in general \u2014 is one we need to have.\nThe numbers are staggering. The US throws so many people into prison, the numbers sound fictional. In Pennsylvania, the state where I live, there are  more than 51,000 people serving time in state prisons , about equal to the number of people who live in the state\u2019s capitol, Harrisburg. The national numbers are similarly unthinkable:  about 2.2 million people live in prison cells nationwide. Counting the people who are on parole, on probation, awaiting trial in jail, or otherwise under the supervision of our vast incarceration system, the overall number rises to 7 million, about the population of Hong Kong. And yes, it\u2019s expensive to do all this: we spend more than $60 billion per year locking people up, monitoring their every step, ushering them through criminal court proceedings, and forcing them to be marked as \"ex-cons,\" ex-offenders,\" or, in the worst-case scenarios,  prisoners for life .\nPublic figures from  Rand Paul and George Will to  Newt Gingrich and Van Jones believe we need to talk about these things. And, despite their faults, it's studies like the Temple study that can bring these issues up for public scrutiny. They can at least be used as a jumping-off point \u2014 a way to bring the discussion from, perhaps, a long and hilarious segment on John Oliver\u2019s HBO program to real change that might eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, roll back harsh punishments for non-violent crimes and drug-related offenses , and incarcerate fewer people.\nAnd if any study can insinuate such changes into a national discussion \u2014 whether purposely or not \u2014 that\u2019s a study worth doing.\n","Title":"Corporations are using dubious research to take over prisons | The Verge","Tags":["policy","editorial","us-world"]}
