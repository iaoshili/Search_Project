With that chapter closed (for now), the company is set to continue its relationship with creator Mitch Hurwitz.  According to Deadline , it's managed to sign a multi-year deal with Hurwitz, which will see him both create and produce new shows for the streaming service. \u201CIt is incredibly inspiring to get to produce for Netflix, a company that not only doesn\u2019t resist change, but is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone in forging it,\u201D Hurwitz said in a statement.\nNetflix has spent huge chunks of cash to guarantee itself exclusive rights to content, but rarely pursues lengthy deals with showrunners. So this agreement is evidence of the company's faith in Hurwitz \u2014 even after  The New York Times described season four as a public \"execution\" of Arrested Development that led the show \"down a bad path.\" Hurwitz will also serve as an executive producer on other Netflix shows and as a consultant for the company's future comedy efforts. \"The fact that I\u2019m also getting one month of their streaming right to my TV or Xbox free, well, it really takes the sting out of buying that Xbox,\" Hurwitz added.\n","Title":"'Arrested Development' creator Mitch Hurwitz will be making new shows for Netflix | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","entertainment","tech"]}
