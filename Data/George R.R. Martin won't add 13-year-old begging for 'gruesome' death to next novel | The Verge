{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTwo huge Game of Thrones fans recently earned spots in a future novel from George R.R. Martin by  donating $20,000 to causes close to the author's heart . Sadly, 13-year-old \"Jack B.\" wasn't one of those winners. But when Jack's father showed him a news article about the charity campaign, the young teen felt inspired to donate his \"pocket money\" in hopes that Martin might consider adding just one more person to the next A Song of Ice and Fire book.\nThe only problem is that teenagers usually aren't carrying around a ton of pocket money. Jack's contribution amounted to just £153 (approximately $259.90 USD), but he made sure to include a handwritten note pleading his case. \"Wolves are my most favorite animal,\" the boy wrote to Martin. \"Although I'm not allowed to watch certain bits of Game of Thrones, I do enjoy playing Skyrim and acting out being a warrior with my bokken.\" 13-year-old Jack wrapped up the letter saying he'd \"love\" to appear in Martin's future work. \"A gruesome, grizzly death is all I ask for.\"\nJack's letter to author George R.R. Martin ( The A.V. Club )\nUnfortunately it appears Jack won't get his wish, though Martin appreciated the gesture. \"I cannot tell you how much that moved me,\" he wrote in a response to the boy. But the campaign's big spenders \u2014 one of whom  is a Facebook employee \u2014 will be the only people going into The Wind of Winter. \"Those spots have already been filled by some very generous donors, and there\u2019s a limit to how many people even I can kill.\" If Jack's parents had forked out $20,000, it's likely Martin would have had no problem beheading the 13-year-old in fiction, or finding some other grisly end for his character. Still, as a show of thanks for the small but meaningful donation, Martin and Prizeo made their own contribution of $10,000 to a wolf conservation trust that Jack mentioned in his original letter.\n","Title":"George R.R.
