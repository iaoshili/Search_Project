{"Main text":"Lyft aims to pick up businesses with new 'for Work' program\nRide the pink mustache to your next corporate event\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber and Lyft are both trying to move far beyond their usual weekender clientele. Back in July, Uber launched a business-oriented version of its ridesharing service, which allowed companies to easily cover travel costs for employees. And now Lyft is charting the same course. Today it's announced Lyft for Work, a program designed to \"let companies purchase and issue Lyft credits to employees for commuting, special events, or recruiting purposes.\"\nLyft's brought on 29 partners at launch, including Adobe and Yelp. Participating companies can issue their employees a monthly credit balance, but they can also take more granular over routes; credits can be applied \"exclusively to rides to and from the office\" \u2014 even during certain hours. Businesses can also whitelist specific company events for credit use. Lyft says it'll be announcing more partners in the very near future. For now, it's managed to counter Uber in their ongoing, cutthroat rivalry.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
