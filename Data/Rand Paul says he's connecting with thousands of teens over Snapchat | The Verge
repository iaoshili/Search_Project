He's already  attacked his opponents on Pinterest and copped his  logo from Tinder , but now the Kentucky senator is getting familiar with Snapchat. In  a recent interview with Politico's Mike Allen, Paul took some time to outline his Snapchat-focused game plan for getting teenagers to vote for him.\nSnapchats for Rand\n\"We reach thousands of kids that we might not ever have reached before,\" Paul said. \"In fact, we're probably reaching some kids who aren't yet 18, that will be 18 when the elections roll around the next time. We'll have whole classrooms sometimes do a Snapchat to us.\"\n\"Like 30 or 40 kids in a high school class will do a quick Snapshot [sic] to us,\" he added.\nA whole classroom of Snapshots! Just think.\nRand first announced he'd be  using Snapchat as a campaign tool back in January, and that his handle would be SenatorRandPaul.\nRand also doled out some advice that should resonate with teens: \"You don't want to replace your parents with the government.\" That's true, but \u2014 hear me out \u2014 what if we replaced the government with Snapchat?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
