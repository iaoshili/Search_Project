{"Main text":"Ancient seltzer bottle recovered from Polish shipwreck\n200-year-old Selters bottle is still corked\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA 200-year-old bottle of naturally carbonated water has been found, according to Discovery News . The perfectly preserved stoneware vessel was recovered from a shipwreck in the Gulf of Gda≈Ñsk near the Polish coast, and is dated between 1806 and 1830.\nUnderwater archaeologist Tomasz Bednarz told Discovery News this may be the oldest corked bottle from Selters, the German community famous for producing the eponymous brand of natural soda water. Though unlikely, Bednarz has not ruled out the possibility the bottle may house wine instead of water, as such containers could have been reused and recorked. Plans are being made to examine its contents in a lab. The 12-inch bottle is the most valuable artifact taken from the wreck which was dubbed F-33-31 or, \"Glazik\" (Boulders in Polish), by archaeologists. The ship is believed to have carried construction material along the Baltic Coast.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
