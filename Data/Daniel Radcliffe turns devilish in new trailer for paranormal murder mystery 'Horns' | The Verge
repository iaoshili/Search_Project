{"Main text":"Daniel Radcliffe turns devilish in new trailer for paranormal murder mystery 'Horns'\n'Harry Potter' actor grows two new appendages in upcoming movie\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHarry Potter might be a movie murderer. Daniel Radcliffe, who played the teen wizard in the eight-film series, has moved on to very different roles since his time at Hogwarts ended. His upcoming film, Horns, sees him adopting an American accent and being accused of killing his girlfriend. The movie's  latest trailer aired first at Comic-Con , and opens with Radcliffe in happier times, before shifting to show him trying to cope as bony appendages grow out of his head and his life falls apart.\nHorns is based on a book by author Joe Hill, and opens in the US on Halloween after  premiering last year at the Toronto film festival. The movie adaptation was directed by Alexandre Aja, who also directed 2003's blood-soaked Switchblade Romance and wrote the unsettling Maniac, a horror movie shot from the first-person perspective of a killer Elijah Wood. From its trailers, Horns appears slightly less brutal in tone than those movies, but it keeps some of their violence \u2014 at the end of the new trailer, a horned Radcliffe incites reporters to beat each other up in a bid to win an exclusive interview with him.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
