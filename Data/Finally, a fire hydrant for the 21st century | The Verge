{"Main text":"Finally, a fire hydrant for the 21st century\nA retired New York firefighter invents a safer, smarter, and sturdier hydrant\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCome along with The Verge for the second season of Detours . We\u2019ve traveled across the country to find the people, groups, and companies that are solving America\u2019s problems in new and unconventional ways.\nNew York City, with its dense population and endless skyscrapers, is notoriously difficult to fight fires in. Firefighters depend on nearly 100,000 hydrants to do their work, but many of these hydrants are in disrepair. Vulnerable to misuse and exposed to extreme weather, the city\u2019s hydrants are decayed, leaking, and corroding.\n\u201CThere are so many defected hydrants,\u201D says Vincent Dunn, a retired Deputy Chief of New York City Fire Department. \u201CIn the \u201970s it was so prevalent that we developed a radio signal \u2014 1070. It meant the first arriving engine didn\u2019t have water because of a defective hydrant. Other fire trucks would stretch out hoses and assist the first pumper with water.\u201D But when a fire is blazing, every second spent stretching hoses is a second that could be used to save lives.\nGeorge Sigelakis, a retired New York City firefighter, understood the need for a hydrant redesign early on in his career. \u201CA hydrant is a lifeline to a firefighter,\u201D he says. \u201CYou can have manpower and millions of dollars worth of trucks and equipment, but without water out of a hydrant, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201D\nConventional hydrants are made up of steel, iron, and rubber parts. \u201CIn an environment with water, all three of those things don\u2019t hold up over time,\u201D says Sigelakis. Some hydrants are cracked open and tampered with by residents looking to gain respite from the heat, or water to wash their cars. As a result, hydrants are caught in an endless cycle of maintenance. Repainting and repairing costs are in the millions of dollars. \u201CIts a great business for manufacturers who make these hydrants,\u201D Sigelakis says. \u201CThey keep selling parts. But, lives are at stake.\u201D\n\"Without water out of a hydrant, you can't do anything.\"\nSigelakis decided to reinvent the hydrant, and started conceptualizing a new model in his basement. He deconstructed the traditional hydrant, analyzed it, and developed the next generation of hydrant design: the Sigelock Spartan. Virtually indestructible, the Spartan is made of stainless steel and ductile iron, and covered in a powder coating that makes the design non-corrosive even in the face of storms and salty water. An efficient internal drainage system prevents the damage that freezing water can inflict. The hydrant can be opened within seconds\u2014but only with a special wrench, discouraging tampering. The Spartan is manufactured in Pennsylvania and comes with a fifty year warranty.\nDespite its benefits, Spartan adoption is slow. \u201CMunicipalities have stockpiled parts for years,\u201D says Joseph Kelly, the Senior Operations Officer at Sigelock Spartan. \u201CWhen we approach them about this new technology, they understand the issues because they work on this everyday. But, they also have a lot of money invested in replacement parts.\u201D\nThere are currently 150 Spartans across a dozen states including Florida and Massachusetts. In New York, installation has so far been restricted to Long Island. \u201CTypically, municipalities buy one or two and put it through its paces for a four-season cycle,\u201D says Kelly. As the Spartan proves itself to be the future of hydrants, Kelly expects sales to improve. \u201CIt\u2019s not an overnight process. But, we\u2019re making inroads.\u201D\n","Title":"Finally, a fire hydrant for the 21st century | The Verge","Tags":["design","verge-detours","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"4584535"]}
