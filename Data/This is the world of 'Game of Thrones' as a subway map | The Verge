{"Main text":"This is the world of 'Game of Thrones' as a subway map\nAll routes will probably still get you killed in a terrible fashion\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGetting around Westeros often leads to trouble, but what if there was a subway? Designer Michael Tyznik has imagined just such a scenario, and put together a fictional rail map of the fictional kingdom from the Game of Thrones series that will take you from the Shadow Tower to King's Landing with just one transfer station. If only it were so simple \u2014 but then George R.R. Martin's books would have been more like a food blog.\nTyznik says he was inspired to create the maps of Westeros and The Known World from Cameron Booth's Tumblr of transit maps , and has included all sorts of small touches like noting certain stations that are \"not in service\" to coincide with plot points from the books. Both are  being sold as prints, and can be seen at higher resolution (albeit with giant watermarks) on  Tyznik's Flickr.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
