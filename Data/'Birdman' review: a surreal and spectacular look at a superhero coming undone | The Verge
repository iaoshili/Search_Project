{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere\u2019s a moment in Birdman where Michael Keaton\u2019s washed-up movie actor Riggan Thomson stands swaying near the edge of a New York City rooftop. \u201CHey,\u201D yells a woman off-screen, \u201Cis this for real or are you shooting a film?\u201D A film, he shouts back. \u201CYou people,\u201D she calls to him, \u201Care full of shit.\u201D\nIt\u2019s the closest thing the movie \u2014 which switches genres at the literal snap of a finger and uses a madcap set of camera angles to tell a story that can only be described as gleefully meta \u2014 comes to having a thesis. Riggan, and his attempt to prove himself as an artist through the staging of a Raymond Carver adaption, is full of shit. The powerful New York Times theater critic, making or breaking careers in an outdated, archaic industry with a martini in hand, is full of shit.\nBut unlike other movies that deal with artists who are full of it and deranged as they cast their egos in every direction, Birdman doesn\u2019t pass judgement on the posers. After all, that would be sort of hypocritical; this is a movie about authenticity that\u2019s as stylized and whimsical as any big-budget action movie. It\u2019s also a story about making a stage play that just happens to have been filmed using the most conspicuous tricks in the film-nerd canon.\nBirdman takes place almost entirely in the St. James Theater in New York\u2019s theater district \u2014 in my mind, the same morbid, schizophrenic Broadway in which the cult dark comedy Death to Smoochy was shot. Here, the middle-aged Riggan Thomson \u2014 formerly Birdman, of a fantastically successful superhero franchise \u2014 has sunk most of his money and sense of self-worth into the task of writing, directing, and starring in an adaptation of Raymond Carver\u2019s What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. That the Carver story is just about the single most likely thing to be assigned on day one of a freshman lit class is the first of many nods to Birdman\u2019s alternate title: The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.\nIn another movie, Riggan's hallucinations might signal insanity\nMichael Keaton\u2019s Riggan may be ignorant, but he\u2019s not unselfconscious. Despite the reassurance of his best friend and left-hand-man Jake \u2014 played by Zach Galifianakis \u2014 on the eve of the play\u2019s preview, Riggan is coming unravelled. Caught between the egotism that led him to recast himself as a True Artist in the first place and a nagging, vain sense that his celebrity disqualifies him from having to play anyone else\u2019s game, he ping-pongs between different shades of delusion, desperate to prove he is anything but, as one critic puts it, \"a Hollywood clown in a Lycra birdsuit.\"\nIn another movie, Riggan\u2019s hallucinations \u2014 the voice of a younger, more famous Birdman growling in his ear about the haters, his ability to levitate objects in his dressing room \u2014 might signal insanity. Here, his superhero powers are just an extension of the movie\u2019s odd, circular world, one where art and reality are blurred to the point of being near-indistinguishable.\nWhen one of Riggan\u2019s lead actors needs to be replaced at the last minute, he goes even further into debt to cast Mike Shiner, played by Edward Norton. Shiner is a critically acclaimed and famously difficult actor, obsessed with lofty notions of art. As many have already noted, Riggan Thomson\u2019s washed-up Hollywood celebrity has a spooky resonance given Keaton\u2019s status as a semi-reclusive former Batman; it\u2019s also worth noting that Norton, patron saint of complicated and difficult men, is an award winning and choosy actor with a history of, for example, refusing to promote movies he\u2019s starred in on creative grounds. This is a movie so circular \u2014 and acted in such a big, expansive way \u2014 you start to look for these sorts of associations everywhere.\nThey\u2019re joined by a large, almost impossibly acrobatic cast: there\u2019s Naomi Watts, peacocking her best sharp and ruined Mean Girl; Andrea Riseborough as Riggan\u2019s open-faced co-star and lover; Amy Ryan in the role of his measured and rueful ex-wife. The British stage actor Lindsay Duncan has a killer cameo as the frosty, red-nosed theater critic who deals out prim, evil judgements. And Emma Stone, in a kind of metaphor for her career thus far, is banished to the background as Riggan\u2019s daughter and assistant, only to explode halfway through the film in a fantastic extended monologue so teenaged and furious I thought her eyes might pop out of her skull.\n\"Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige.\"\nBut for a movie with an impressive ensemble cast there\u2019s very little ensemble to Birdman. Rarely do you see more than two characters in a room at a time \u2014 which brings us to the part about film-nerd tricks. The movie, thanks to deft editing and a fantastic amount of precision on the part of its actors, appears to take place in a single tracking shot. The camera winds through the corridors of the James, swooping behind the actors as they move from stage to dressing room to costume department; the already cramped and labyrinthine theater becomes like a damaged, human-sized anthill.\nBut the uniquely cinematic move used most often in Birdman is, crucially, the close-up. Birdman is full of close-ups; so much so that most of the movie is told through extended pieces of dialog between two people, camera trained close. The movie feels, at times, like a series of progressively intensifying sketches. This tactic also ensures, especially as the fabric of reality starts to come undone later on, that we only really know the characters based on how they\u2019ve projected their (full of shit) selves onto each other. It\u2019s just one of the excellent, sly technical gags that make this near-perfect movie feel delightful despite its existential weight.\nBirdman\u2019s broad, ambitious themes \u2014 the blurry distinction between high art and low, the tenuous division between perception and truth \u2014 have been chewed through everywhere from Charlie Kaufman movies to reality TV. In Synecdoche, NY, a Kaufman film quite similar to Birdman, fantasy is pathologized: it\u2019s a great, sad movie. Birdman, in contrast, is jubilant, a fantastic extended riff about people who righteously desire not just success, but a life that looks and feels like a work of art. And that\u2019s a particularly relatable theme, in 2014.\n","Title":"'Birdman' review: a surreal and spectacular look at a superhero coming undone | The Verge","Tags":["culture","review","movie-reviews","entertainment"]}
