{"Main text":"33 Comments\nIf you\u2019re looking for something to watch this weekend, you\u2019ve got plenty of options. Tom Cruise\u2019s latest sci-fi jaunt Edge of Tomorrow is hitting theaters, and if time travel and aliens aren\u2019t your thing, there\u2019s the YA tear-jerker The Fault in Our Stars, starring Divergent\u2019s Shailene Woodley. There\u2019s even a brand new season of Orange Is the New Black on Netflix to tuck into if you\u2019re in a binge watching kind of mood.\nOf course, that's just scratching the service of all the movies and shows that will be coming in the months ahead \u2014 so let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nMade in America\nRon Howard\u2019s documentary about Jay Z\u2019s 2012 Made in America music festival debuted last year on Showtime, but now it\u2019s getting ready to come to DVD and on-demand services. Featuring appearances from Janelle Monáe, Kanye West, Skrillex, and more, the film will be available on July 22nd \u2014 just in time to get audiences primed for this year\u2019s festival, which will be taking place in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles in August.\nThe Giver\nThe latest trailer for director Philip Noyce\u2019s adaptation of this dystopian novel adds a little stylistic flair to go along with the Oscar-winning acting talent. In a seemingly-perfect \u2014 if a bit bland \u2014 future utopia, Brenton Thwaites (The Signal) is under the tutelage of Jeff Bridges, known as The Giver. The older mentor pulls back the curtain to reveal that the world is more dynamic and richer than Thwaites has ever seen before, and he soon becomes a threat to society that must be stopped.\nHercules\nThere\u2019s not a lot to say about this one. It\u2019s The Rock. It\u2019s directed by the man behind the Rush Hour trilogy. There\u2019s a lion hat and lots of fights.\nIs it time for a new episode of Game of Thrones yet?\nThe Green Inferno\nAnytime horror maestro Eli Roth makes a movie, there\u2019s a few things you can count on. A lot of people will hate it because of his unflinching approach to violence. It will feature striking, sometimes beautiful imagery. And really, really horrible things will happen, leaving you rattled and wondering why you watched the movie in the first place. For genre fans, that\u2019s a perfect combination, and The Green Inferno looks to continue the tradition.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018Made In America,\u2019 \u2018The Giver,\u2019 \u2018Hercules,\u2019 and \u2018The Green Inferno\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
