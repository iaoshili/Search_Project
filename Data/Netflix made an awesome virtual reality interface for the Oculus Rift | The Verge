{"Main text":"Netflix made an awesome virtual reality interface for the Oculus Rift\nThis better turn into more than a Hack Day project\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike any good Silicon Valley company, Netflix has the occasional Hack Day, in which it allows its engineers to forgo their other responsibilities and just build something cool. It turns out Netflix engineers have some pretty awesome ideas. Today, the company released a handful of videos of its favorite Hack Day projects, including a Chrome extension that lets you watch Netflix in a mini screen while you do something else and a way to match your movie to your room's ambient lighting with Philips Hue bulbs.\nNetflix did of course provide the \"most or all of these projects are just fun and will never actually be a part of Netflix\" disclaimer, but if it doesn't eventually make the floating, flying, gesture-based Oculix interface for the Oculus Rift, then, well, everything is ruined. This is how I want to find movies in the future.\nCheck out Oculix in the video above \u2014 and click below for the rest of the Netflix Hack Day projects.\nNetflix Hue\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
