{"Main text":"Google argues its case against EU antitrust charges in internal memo\n'The competition is just one click away,' the memo says\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle is on the eve of a major battle with European regulators, as the European Commission is set to file  antitrust charges against the company . But Google is already preparing: Recode has obtained  an internal memo sent to Google employees about the charges.\nIt's unclear what specific charges the EU will bring against Google, but it's believed the charges  will focus on whether Google used its dominance in the search market to favor its own results. In the memo, Google lays out its case, essentially arguing that its services (Google Shopping, specifically) are already open to competition. From the memo :\nThe competition is just one click away \u2014 and it\u2019s growing. People can use Bing, Yahoo, Quora, DuckDuckGo, and a new wave of search assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, as well as more specialized services like Amazon, Idealo, Le Guide, Expedia, or eBay. In addition, users increasingly turn to social networks like Facebook and Twitter to find news and suggestions \u2014 where to eat or which movies to watch.\nThe memo does not bring up any allegations about the company favoring its own results. (Key members of the FTC brought up such complaints against Google , although the agency ultimately decided against suing.)The memo continues:\nMobile is changing everything \u2014 with the explosion of apps taking people directly to the information they want. Today 7 out of every 8 minutes on mobile devices is spent within apps. Yelp, for example, has said that over 40% of its traffic comes direct from its mobile app.\nCompetition online is thriving \u2014 despite what many of the complainants in this case allege. Indeed if you look at shopping, it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay) that has not been harmed by Google\u2019s own shopping service.\nGoogle goes on to reproduce charts showing the rise of rivals like Amazon, but does not include some of the facts that have most concerned regulators. Google holds about a 90 percent market share of search in Europe, and antitrust charges have been years in the making. The Commission is expected to also open a formal investigation into Android, which Google, in the memo, says \"is just the start of a process and does not mean the EC will necessarily take action.\" The document also asks that employees not comment \"on pending legal issues, internally or externally.\"\nWhatever the specific charges, Google is facing a fight: the company could be looking at more than $6 billion in penalties.\n","Title":"Google argues its case against EU antitrust charges in internal memo | The Verge","Tags":["google","policy","us-world","tech"]}
