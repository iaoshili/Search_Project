I first heard about the existence of this laptop sticker shortly before the first Windows 10 event in September, and I\u2019ve been trying to track it down ever since. The stickers magically appeared on Microsoft's campus, and Windows team members have snapped them up and some use them on their laptops. It\u2019s the perfect example of a company with a bit of personality, and something you rarely see from a corporate giant like Microsoft. The software maker even has a Windows t-shirt it's handing out at Mobile World Congress this week that mocks the lack of Windows 9 (see below).\nExcel keyboards on Android are cool, and  great iOS email apps or crazy  HoloLens headsets are even cooler, but this laptop sticker is the definition of cool. I mean, just look at it. It\u2019s a ninja cat riding a fire-breathing unicorn, all while waving a Windows flag.  It might be lacking a rainbow, lasers shooting from the unicorn\u2019s eyes, and nyan cat running away from a Minecraft world, but it\u2019s still cool. It\u2019s official, Microsoft really is cool again.\nSaw this Windows t-shirt at the Microsoft booth today.
