She's the first ambassador to complete an oath of office using an electronic device, but not the first US public official, as  The Washington Post points out . Earlier this year, a Long Island county official and New Jersey firefighters laid their hands on iPads to complete their oaths after ceremony organizers were unable to find physical copies of the Bible.\n","Title":"US ambassador is first to take oath on an electronic device | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
