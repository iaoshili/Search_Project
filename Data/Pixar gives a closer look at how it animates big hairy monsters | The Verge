It starts with Presto, Pixar's internal animation system that allows the company to manipulate Monsters University's characters with an incredible degree of precision. The Pixar engineer illustrated how with a few clicks, an animator can move Sully's arms, legs, eyes, nose, and lips \u2014 1500 animation controls in all \u2014 and do it in real-time without dropping a frame.\nMoving an arm and a leg might not sound like much \u2014 until you consider that doing so also entails moving Sully's 900,000 hairs, each with 4 points drawn by a GPU. It's something Pixar couldn't do just a few years ago, meaning animators had to work with a naked version of Sully that was harder to manipulate effectively. \"It was a breakthrough on Monsters U using the GPUs to draw each piece of fur in real-time,\" the engineer said. \"It's really important to us to be able to create an environment that can be playful, where the animator can just reach in, grab that character, and start moving him around in real-time without having to worry about slow, bogging down speeds.\" Check out the full video embedded above.\n","Title":"Pixar gives a closer look at how it animates big hairy monsters | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
