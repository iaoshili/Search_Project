{"Main text":"41 Comments\nThe Walkman may have started the first portable music revolution, but the iPod began the second. It increasingly put thousands upon thousands of songs in your pocket, and made it so that no one ever had to leave behind a track from their library again. And beyond all of that, it just happened to kickstart Apple\u2019s dominating position in mobile.\nToday, just shy of the 13th anniversary of its initial release, the classic iPod is finally being discontinued. Here\u2019s a look back across the revolutionary line of MP3 players, from its simple beginnings, to its flashy days of glory, right down to its final redesign.\nLead image by Michael Shane.\n3rd generation iPod classic from Matthew Pearce (Flickr) .\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nFirst generation, 2001. The original iPod famously put \u201C1,000 songs in your pocket.\u201D It had a scroll wheel that physically rotated, a giant FireWire port on top for charging and syncing, and was available in 5 and 10GB models for $399 and $499 respectively.\nSecond generation, 2002. The iPod\u2019s second version was almost identical to its first, but it replaced the original device\u2019s mechanical wheel with a touch-sensitive one. Storage space was also doubled at both price points, and for the first time it supported use on Windows.\nThird generation, 2003. For its first redesign, the iPod slimmed down drastically, dropping FireWire in favor of the 30-pin connector that Apple used for nearly a decade afterward, and turning the playback controls into capacitive touch buttons. Base storage stayed at 10GB, but 30 and 40GB models were also offered. (Image credit: Matthew Pearce \/ Flickr)\nFourth generation, 2004. The iPod\u2019s next redesign introduced the Click Wheel, with playback controls built right into the scroll ring. It came in 20 and 40GB models, and an updated model featuring a color display was introduced just months later.\nThe iPod didn\u2019t just sell itself. Apple ran an aggressive \u2014 and soon iconic \u2014 advertising campaign for several years that featured silhouetted figures dancing to music played off bright white iPods. They were hard to miss, and hard not to like.\nFifth generation, 2005. The penultimate iPod redesign was the first classic to be available in both black and white. It had a flat front, a color display, and was offered in 30, 60, and 80GB models. Also known as the iPod video, it was the first iPod to support movie playback.\nWhile the initial iPod ads featured solid, brightly colored backgrounds, the later ones got a little more complicated with scattered backgrounds, eclectic colors schemes, and more detailed models. Even so, they were as fun and energetic as ever.\nSixth generation, 2007. The iPod\u2019s final redesign, and how it stayed for over six years. It replaced the iPod\u2019s iconic white front with silver and black brushed aluminum options, and was offered at various times in 80, 120, and 160GB models. Its debut also coincided with two major changes for Apple's MP3 players: the suffix \u201Cclassic\u201D across the iPod line, and the introduction of the very first iPod touch.\n","Title":"iPod classic comes to an end: a look back at Apple's iconic music player | The Verge","Tags":["apple","design","tech"]}
