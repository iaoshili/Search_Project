{"Main text":"Bendy Lego-like bricks might become the building blocks of the robot apocalypse\nClick-e-bricks could lead to self-replicating robots\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe machine overlords of our dystopian future may have more in common with Gumby than the Terminator, if the field of \"soft robotics\" continues to expand.Â  New Scientist reports that George Whitesides and his team in Harvard University have come up with squishy, Lego-inspired blocks that might one day lead to self-replicating robots.\nThe team began by creating a mould which was filled with flexible plastic in order to produce the actual click-fit elastomeric bricks, or \"click-e-bricks.\" The blocks have since been used to develop everything from simple structures to reconfigurable LED circuits. Ultimately, Whitesides' team hopes to have robots that can manipulate bricks on their own, possibly allowing for on-the-fly repairs.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
