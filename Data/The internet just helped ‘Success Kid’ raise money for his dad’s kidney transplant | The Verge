{"Main text":"The internet just helped \u2018Success Kid\u2019 raise money for his dad\u2019s kidney transplant\nThe best kind of success\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJustin Griner, father of the child who shot to internet fame as the  \"Success Kid\" meme , has raised nearly $100,000 through a  crowdfunding campaign to pay for a kidney transplant. Griner, 39, became ill in 2006 and suffered full kidney failure in 2009, forcing him to go on dialysis. The family set up a GoFundMe campaign last week to raise money for a transplant, and has already surpassed its original goal of $75,000.\nSam Griner, whose triumphant, beachside fist-pump went viral in 2007, is now eight years old. His mother, Laney, set up the GoFundMe page for her husband to help cover the expensive treatments that Medicare covers for only a limited time. In an interview with The Daily Dot this week, she said a kidney transplant would be the only way to save her husband's life, noting that his mother died from the same disease. \"We're the parents of 'Success Kid' for goodness sake,\" Laney Griner said. \"If anyone understands the power, the mass, and goodwill of the internet, it's those of us lucky to experience it daily.\"\nA photo posted by Laney Griner (@laneymg) on\nJul 24, 2014 at 11:04am PDT\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
