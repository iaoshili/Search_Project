Here's Reznor's description,  as told to the Wall Street Journal , followed by Fincher's slight correction:\nReznor: \"[Fincher] said, 'Think about the really terrible music you hear in massage parlors... The way that it artificially tries to make you feel like everything's OK. And then imagine that sound starting to curdle and unravel.'\"\nFincher: \"I said a spa, not a massage parlor! I was listening to that calming, placating music and thought, we need to tap into this. The movie is about the facade of the good neighbor, the good Christian, the good wife. So the notion was to start with music that's attempting to give you a hug.\"\nThis weekend, the NIN frontman  released a preview of the Gone Girl soundtrack. Comparatively, the direction Fincher gave for the Academy Award-winning Social Network score was reportedly, \"the sound of creativity.\" Gone Girl opens October 3rd.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
