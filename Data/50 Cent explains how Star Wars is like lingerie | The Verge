{"Main text":"50 Cent explains how Star Wars is like lingerie\n\"Watch this metaphor, it's a little sophisticated.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast year at CES, we  talked to 50 Cent at length about SMS Audio , the company he founded in 2011. So for this year, we decided to keep the interview very focused \u2014 which is to say, we talked almost exclusively about Star Wars, since one of the company's big announcements this year was a new set of themed headphones. We talk about his favorite character (\"I like the bad guys\"), his upcoming solo and G-Unit albums, and... yep, a metaphor about a galaxy far, far away.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
