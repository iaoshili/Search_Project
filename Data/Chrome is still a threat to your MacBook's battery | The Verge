{"Main text":"Chrome is still a threat to your MacBook's battery\nThe awesomeness of Chrome comes at a price\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle\u2019s Chrome is the best web browser for my needs. Apple\u2019s MacBooks are the best computers for my needs. So why is the combination of the two such a wretched and chronically compromised situation? Almost every advice column on how to improve MacBook battery life begins with the suggestion to avoid using Chrome in favor of Apple\u2019s more efficient Safari browser. The idea that Chrome is a big and profligate battery drain on MacBooks has existed almost as long as the browser has been available, and most benchmarks reiterate it by showing Chrome\u2019s gluttonous consumption of system resources for seemingly basic tasks.\nI guess I hoped that by 2015 things would be different.\nWhile reviewing the new MacBook Pro with Retina display , I ran the usual Verge battery test on Apple\u2019s new machine. With the screen set to 65 percent brightness, it cycles through a series of websites until the laptop\u2019s battery gives out. The native Safari made the new Retina machine look good: 13 hours and 18 minutes. Google\u2019s Chrome, on the other hand, forced the laptop to tap out at 9 hours and 45 minutes.\nSafari lasts three and a half hours longer than Chrome\nIf I\u2019m taking off on a trip from London, then Safari would be with me all the way to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, or Seoul. Chrome would require a pit stop to recharge somewhere over the Indian subcontinent. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is insane. It\u2019s the same exact computer. The battery, the processor, the memory \u2014 nothing changes but the web browser and the MacBook\u2019s endurance is suddenly scythed down by a whopping three and a half hours.\nIt\u2019s not just the distance you can go with Chrome that\u2019s an issue. The speed and quality of the ride are also compromised. The widely used SunSpider browser benchmark clocks the MacBook Pro in at 203ms when using Chrome. Safari scores 30 percent better with a time of 144ms. Same machine, very different outcomes. You\u2019d think YouTube would be a spot where Google collects an easy win, but that\u2019s been another cause of distress: the new 4K 60fps videos that YouTube now supports are playable on the MacBook, but only \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 when using Safari and not Chrome. Google\u2019s own browser chokes while playing back video from Google\u2019s own video service.\nYears of complaints, but little improvement\nApple and Google must both bear a portion of the blame for this ongoing disparity. The MacBook maker has a vested interest in promoting Safari as the most efficient, fluid, and pleasing web experience on its platform. Safari will always have the advantage of being optimized for the latest OS X release ahead of any other browser, which means its lead in efficiency will never be completely eradicated. But three and a half hours? That\u2019s the sort of gap that Google should be able to close \u2014 if it makes optimization its priority.\nThere\u2019s a certain sense of futility to the words I\u2019m typing. They\u2019re going into a Google Doc nestled within one of many Chrome tabs on a Mac. I live my life in Chrome and in Google apps. The release of Safari 8 made me curious enough to try and switch camps, but Safari\u2019s tab management is atrocious, including the absence of a shortcut to recover more than my last closed tab. It\u2019s the little things that keep me hooked to Chrome, like not having to install any translation extensions or log into Google services once I\u2019m signed into the browser. But if I\u2019m not willing to change, why would Google?\nVerge Video: Reviewing the new MacBook\n","Title":"Chrome is still a threat to your MacBook's battery | The Verge","Tags":["apple","google","tech","essay"]}
