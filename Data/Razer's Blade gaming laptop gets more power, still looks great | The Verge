{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRazer's not giving up in its quest to build the perfect laptop for gamers; today, the company announced an updated version of its 14-inch Razer Blade. Launching at Microsoft Stores on February 16th (you can place an order starting today), the new Blade starts at the same $2,199 as the model it's replacing. From the outside, things look more or less the same compared toÂ  what we saw in March of last year. The Razer Blade still houses its powerful silicon inside a nice aluminum chassis, and this revision sticks with the same, plenty sharp 3200 x 1800 multi-touch display as last time. It's light, it feels incredibly solid, and it's still one of the most capable Windows laptops on the market.\nChanges start with the machine's memory. It now includes 16GB of RAM standard versus the 8GB from last year. Both the CPU and GPU have been bumped up to some of the latest offerings from Intel and Nvidia, respectively. The new Blade ships with a Core i7-4720HQ quad-core processor clocked at 2.6GHz \u2014 with turbo boost speeds up to 3.6GHz. And on the graphics end, Razer has chosen Nvidia's GeForce GTX 970M to do the heavy lifting for your gaming needs. The GTX 970M is based on Nvidia's Maxwell architecture, and early benchmarks show it'll handle most of what you throw at it just fine.\n","Title":"Razer's Blade gaming laptop gets more power, still looks great | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","tech"]}
