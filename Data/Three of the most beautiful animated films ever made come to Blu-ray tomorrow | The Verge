All three films were directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by his famed Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli. As a group, they're a  nice sampling of Miyazaki's work. Kiki's Delivery Service is one of his early, charming children's films. Princess Mononoke is a more mature fantasy about environmentalism. And The Wind Rises, which Miyazaki believed would be his final film as a director, is a fictional biography of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of  the Zero plane .\nAll three films are heart melting mixes of happiness and sadness, the emotional equivalent of mixing salts and sugars. Our own Vlad Savov remembers Princess Mononoke helping him deal with a stressful exam period. After I saw The Wind Rises, the audience at the theater just sat in silence through the credits, and once those came to a close I could hear people sniffling all around me.\nI've included a smattering of trailers and clips to help anyone on the fence get the gist of what makes these films so special.
