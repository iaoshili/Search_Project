{"Main text":"Apple is giving Netflix and Hulu a pass on its 30 percent tax\nA lower subscription fee from Apple could make its Apple TV a serious option for cable channels\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple has been charging a 30 percent subscription fee to publishers using subscription models in its App Stores since 2011, but it looks like that practice hasn't been extended to the Apple TV. According to  Recode , Apple is charging some of the more high-profile video services like Netflix, Hulu Plus, and MLB.TV a 15 percent fee for any subscribers who join the service through its Apple TV.\nThe further Apple gets away from the customary 50 percent share that cable providers demand from premium channels, the more likely Apple is to draw serious interest from channels looking to follow the  HBO NOW model. Many channels available on Apple TV require a cable subscription to access, but if Apple decides to take a smaller share of the subscription revenue, it could put even more pressure on the cable companies to offer better deals, and that's always a good thing. With a new Apple TV and an App Store  reportedly slated to arrive at WWDC, we'll soon know how much of an effect that 15 percent discount has had on some of the more entrenched TV channels.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
