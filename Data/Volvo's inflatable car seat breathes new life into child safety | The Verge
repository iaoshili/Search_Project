{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChild car seats are essential for infant and toddler safety, but that doesn't mean that parents are happy to use them. The seats are bulky and heavy, and they're a pain to position correctly. But what if you could inflate a child seat once it was in position and then deflate it and stuff it into a bag when you're finished? That could soon be a reality if Volvo's new concept rear-facing child restraint makes it into production. The Swedish carmaker's concept seat has a built-in pump that can inflate it in just 40 seconds, and deflated, the whole package is about 18 x 20 x 8 inches (45 x 50 x 20cm) \u2014 portable enough to fit into some luggage or a large bag. It weighs just over 11 pounds (5kg).\nThis isn't the first time that a manufacturer has experimented with inflatables for a car seat, but this appears to be the first rear-facing inflatable child seat. Some others on the market are booster seats , which are designed for older children and use the car's built-in seatbelts. Volvo's rear-facing seat concept has a five-point harness and it's designed for children up to three years old. To offer that kind of restraint, Volvo's using drop-stitch fabric, which is employed in applications such as inflatable boats. To boot, it's an attractive seat that looks like it'd be at home in a leather-clad Scandinavian vehicle. Unfortunately, Volvo isn't offering any more details about the concept, like whether it plans to bring it into production, but at least it shows that there is a better way.\n","Title":"Volvo's inflatable car seat breathes new life into child safety | The Verge","Tags":["concepts","design"]}
