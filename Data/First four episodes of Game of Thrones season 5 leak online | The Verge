{"Main text":"First four episodes of Game of Thrones season 5 leak online\nSpoilers are coming\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe fifth season of Game of Thrones premieres tonight on HBO, but it\u2019s getting an early airing on the internet. While you\u2019d normally have to wait four weeks to see the initial four episodes of the series, they\u2019ve been leaked to torrent sites and some fans are scrambling to download them. Having one episode leak is bad enough, but four means fans will have to avoid internet spoilers for a month or download the episodes illegally.\nThe leaked copies appear to be 480p quality, and likely obtained through early screeners. Game of Thrones is no stranger to leaks and illegal downloads. It\u2019s one of the most popular illegally downloaded shows, and a  trailer for season 5 leaked ahead of its official debut. If you want to keep on the official spoiler-free side of Game of Thrones then the  original trailer has been available for a couple of months, and there\u2019s a  couple of clips to prepare yourself for the start of the season. It all begins tonight at 9PM ET with a simultaneous airing across the globe, and we\u2019ll  start to find out who will really win season 5 .\nUpdate, 12:29 PM ET: HBO has released a statement that confirms the leak did come from early screeners. \"Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of Game of Thrones originated from within a group approved by HBO to receive them.\" HBO said. \"We\u2019re actively assessing how this breach occurred.\"\n","Title":"First four episodes of Game of Thrones season 5 leak online | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
