{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nStar Wars: Episode VII is believed to have wrapped filming with the cast and crew attending a huge party over the weekend to celebrate. In addition to a going off party, it also appears that the film's cast and crew received a note signed by director J.J. Abrams and producers Kathleen Kennedy and Bryan Burke, thanking them for working on Episode VII. The note was tweeted out on Friday and has since been pulled, but the image was rehostedÂ  by SlashFilm . You can see the letter and read a transcription below. Then, there's just about a little over a year to go before you can finally watch the movie. It's scheduled for a release on December 18th, 2015.\nTo the Extraordinary Cast and Crew of Episode VII:\nIt is a true honor and absolute joy to come to set every day and work alongside each of you. Your professionalism, passion, and patience is more deeply appreciated than we could ever express. From the deserts of Abu Dhabi, to the Forest of Dean, to the stages of Pinewood, you have risen to every challenge and been as wonderfully kind as you are brilliantly talented. Our ambition here is large, of course, and it must be: we are here to make a film that entertains millions of people, of all ages, for generations. To create an experience people will cherish watching as much as we will cherish having made it, together. How lovely it would be if you had, in addition to your name on the screen, some actual, real, tangible proof that you were part of it! Here, then, is that proof. Wear it well, wear it healthily, wear it proudly. But, mostly, thank you.\nWith love,\n","Title":"Read J.J.
