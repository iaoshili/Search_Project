{"Main text":"6 Comments\nThe comics industry mastered Hollywood a long time ago, but the tried-and-true comic book has had a harder time making the transition to digital. The biggest player in the game right now is Comixology, which long ago established itself as the gold standard of comics distribution online. However, ever since its recent acquisition by Amazon , the app has endured criticism for a new design that \u2014 as a consequence of Amazon's understandable unwillingness to deal with Apple's in-app purchases policy \u2014 effectively breaks what was originally an awesome storefront. But when it comes to alternatives, the last decade is littered with ambitious experiments in the medium that either did too much or just never got off the ground. How do you make a viable digital comics business while pushing the medium forward? It's a tough question to answer, and no one has really made a perfect solution.\nAward-winning writer Mark Waid gets all that, and could be the one to get the business right \u2014 as one of comics' big-name authors, he's worked as a collaborator on a few major projects in digital and even helped with Comixology's earlier well-received design efforts. He's also been an ardent critic of what he sees as excess in the space. And people ought to listen: fans might recognize his work in classics like Marvel\u2019s Age of Apocalypse (a screen adaptation of which will hit theaters in 2016) DC\u2019s Kingdom Come, and Empire, an Eisner-nominated limited series about a supervillain dealing with what happens when you finally take over the world.\nWaid recently struck out on his own, launching Thrillbent in 2012 as a means of showing he gets how digital comics should be made and distributed with both readers and creatives in mind. And it's doing pretty well for an indie shop. His subscriber base is somewhere in the four figures and continues to grow, partly because a monthly subscription to his library costs the same as a single comic. Last month, he expanded the site\u2019s library by returning to Empire, and plans on releasing issues from Volume 2 on a weekly basis to continue the saga. We sat down with him in the weeks before Comic-Con to talk about the new series and where digital comics are going.\nYou\u2019re one of many celebrated writers in comics today. What is your view of the medium right now?\nThis is one of the greatest times in comics I\u2019ve ever seen. And that includes the hit 1980s, which was the last big resurgence with things like Maus and The Dark Knight and Watchmen. But now, thanks largely to the rise of Image Comics and the boom in digital comics, there is outreach to more people who like stuff other than superheroes. Which is key to building a new audience.\nYou\u2019ve been a part of this for more than a decade now...\nYeah exactly. My first work in comics was back in 1985, so I\u2019ve been in the business longer than a lot of my fans have been alive.\nSo where does something like Thrillbent stand alongside digital comics outlets like Comixology?\nWell, the great thing about digital publishing \u2014 and I mean this with all my heart \u2014 is that there\u2019s not a real sense of competition. It\u2019s not like Marvel and DC are Coke and Pepsi, where we\u2019re vying after the same exact audience and you\u2019re measuring your gain by somebody else\u2019s losses. And Comixology does what they do extraordinarily well and I love what they do, but they don\u2019t produce new content themselves. They\u2019re a distributor, an outlet for other people\u2019s materials. What Thrillbent does specifically is we work with younger creators who want to explore all the possibilities of the digital medium and tell stories that can only be told using digital tools. As opposed to some of the other digital comic companies which are basically selling you pictures of comics. They\u2019re not really taking advantage of all the things digital can do.\nBack in 2000 when Empire launched, you and some of your colleagues wanted to launch a comics website with a business model in mind. That became eHero.com, but that eventually folded. Is Thrillbent better positioned, or have the times just changed in general?\nYes. And, by the way, I\u2019d totally forgotten about eHero for about 10 years before you mentioned it, so thanks for reminding me. I\u2019ve been at this digital stuff longer than I thought! No, it\u2019s perfectly positioned, because the beauty of doing something like Thrillbent in digital comics form is that the startup costs are minimal compared to doing something like say a TV pilot or even a YouTube series. It\u2019s pencil and paper and colors and web servers and sweat. So, the fact that comics as a medium right now has really become a driver of pop culture, not just with the superhero movies but with The Walking Dead and all the material that\u2019s coming to movie screens in the near future, we\u2019re in a good position to take advantage of that and go in hard with a lot of brand-new, experimental series. And the nice thing about being a small company is that it\u2019s not like steering a battleship. If we wanna put something up, we put something up. We don\u2019t have to answer to shareholders, we don\u2019t have to construct a massive five-year publishing plan. We can be very light on our feet.\nWhat\u2019s Empire about?\nEmpire is the story of what happens when a supervillain finally wins. There\u2019s no questions of victory. So there are no superheroes waiting to take him down. There are no big, bombastic battles. It\u2019s more of a political intrigue thing of, what do you do once you rule the world? What is next? Golgoth is the emperor of all he surveys, and now what? Now he lives in a sort of science fiction Game of Thrones. He lives in a world that\u2019s the court of The Borgias where everybody who helped him get to where he\u2019s getting is now sharpening their knife, because once you\u2019ve consolidated the world\u2019s power on to one throne, then it makes you a huge target.\nEmpire Volume 2 is more, how does one man maintain the throne and what are the sacrifices people need to make to keep it in place so that you don\u2019t end up with utter chaos? I mean, is it better to have one despot getting the trains running on time, or is better to have complete chaos in the streets? We don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s sort of the driving question.\nWhy return to Empire now?\nBarry Kitson and I co-created Empire almost 15 years ago. We had it published through DC back in the early 2000s. We got an Eisner nomination. We felt really good about it. But since then, Barry and I just haven\u2019t been at the same company at the same time for nearly a decade, so doing a sequel has been one of those things that we\u2019ve been trying to do for a long time. Thrillbent finally gave us the perfect opportunity to do it. Why would I go to any other publisher, when oh yeah I own a publisher?\n\"When people started to experiment with digital comics, there was this inferiority complex that came with it.\"\nComics have struggled in the last few years to grapple with new media and new technologies, with plenty of successes and failures along the way. Was there any particular moment where you feel companies really nailed something or truly lost their way?\nLike I said, one of the things that\u2019s helping the entire medium right now and helping everybody figure out what it can be is the fact that we are pop culture drivers and not just things that reflect pop culture. What I mean by that is that when people were starting to experiment with digital comics as long as 10 or 12 years ago, there was this inferiority complex that came with it. Oh, it\u2019s just pictures on a screen, we need to jazz it up! We gotta have motion! We gotta have sound effects! That sort of coming at it from a feeling that what comics was wasn\u2019t good enough and we needed to add to it. Because what you get out of that, with motion comics and voiceovers or whatever, is it just becomes limited animation. It becomes neither fish nor fowl, right? It becomes something that\u2019s not good enough to be animation but not quite comic either. And I think that\u2019s a massive misstep. I think the guiding star philosophy that we\u2019ve always had with Thrillbent is that what makes comics comics is that you, the reader, control the pace at which you read the story. We have all kinds of interesting digital techniques, but it\u2019s still dependent upon you turning the page. That\u2019s where I think a lot of other digital publishers lose their way. I think they\u2019re too overeager to make it all about sound and motion and time and stuff, and that makes it cheap animation.\nThat of course isn\u2019t to say there hasn\u2019t been a ton of experimentation over the past decade. Are we getting closer to perfecting this new paradigm?\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re that far off. I think we\u2019re getting very close! We\u2019re not trying to make comics something it isn\u2019t. We\u2019re not coming at it from that sense of, \"Oh we have to convince you that our comics are worth reading on the screen.\" No, everybody knows that comics look amazing on an iPad or on an Android tablet or on a laptop screen. As long as you\u2019re producing for that medium and not just trying to scan JPEGs onto a file.\nIt seems to often be about business models and experimentation, right? I mean, right now, Alan Moore is trying to create an open source avenue for creatives to publish comics. Might that be the wave of the future?\nNo. And I say this with all respect to Alan Moore, who is the reason many of us are in this business: I\u2019m leery of taking advice on digital comics from a man who doesn\u2019t own a computer. And I mean that jokingly and not disrespectfully. Online comics and digital comics have always been open source. You know what it is? You draw something, you scan it in, and you put it on a web page. That\u2019s what you do. Boom. There\u2019s nothing terribly proprietary about the way anybody does what they do, and if you go to WordPress there are plugins for your blog that will host comics if you\u2019re so inclined. We\u2019re not trying to fool you with proprietary technology. What we have to sell is content. But what we\u2019re really pushing is the way we deliver this. The content itself, and the way the comic is read and the techniques you can use, not the actual technology.\nWhat about Amazon buying out Comixology? How does that help or harm the medium?\nI have nothing but respect for the Comixology guys, but just because you\u2019re friends with somebody doesn\u2019t mean you have to like their parents. So far it\u2019s been an exercise in making buying digital comics harder for them, not easier. That in time will change, and if Amazon\u2019s purchase of Comixology can help facilitate the outreach so that more people can read comics, I\u2019m fine with that. I think that, in the meantime, the business model that we look at makes the most sense for smaller publishers, which, for the price of one comic, which is $3.99, we will give you access to several different comics worth of material a month and the back library. (And special bonuses to download and so forth.) That just makes a little bit more sense to me than a per-copy sale basis. I\u2019m very curious what Amazon\u2019s ultimate business model is gonna be. I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone would argue that $3.99, $4.99, or $5.99 is way too much for one digital comic. But it is.\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone would argue that $3.99, $4.99, or $5.99 is way too much for one digital comic. But it is.\"\nWhat kind of storytelling do you want writers and artists to do with all the tools at their disposal, if not make them overwrought multimedia affairs?\nIt\u2019s easy to say whatever moves them, which is the God\u2019s honest truth. My footnote to that is \"less superheroes.\" And I\u2019m not knocking superheroes. Superheroes have been very good to me, and I will continue to write superheroes probably 'till the day I die. But it\u2019s a niche market. Comics is a mass medium. Just as when I go to Amazon, I don\u2019t see nothing but Clive Cussler novels. I see all kinds of books. I want people who are doing digital comics for Thrillbent to do whatever strikes them, and let\u2019s just experiment. All I ask is that your story have a beginning, a middle, and an end. All I ask is that it reads like a story. I don\u2019t care what it\u2019s about or what kind of story it is.\nDoes that make you leery of how the Hollywood machine figures into this system?\nNah! That\u2019s what Hollywood is. Have at it. You know what? I\u2019m not worried about Hollywood impinging and here\u2019s why: as a creative person, both as a writer and an artist, there is nothing purer than comics to get your vision across. When you\u2019re making a movie, making a TV show, when you\u2019re answering your studio executives and there\u2019s money on the table, that changes everything. It\u2019s suddenly everybody\u2019s got a decision, everybody\u2019s got a choice, everybody\u2019s got an argument, everybody\u2019s got a change or a tweak. Comics is one of those very few mediums where you can just write something and have it drawn and it goes out to the audience and it\u2019s your vision. Nobody came along to say, \"Hey, can you put a robot dog in it? Because we need the demographics to show people love robot dogs.\"\nDoes that mean Empire will never be a movie?\n[Laughs] I mean, if someone comes to us with a fat checkbook and a really strong vision, I\u2019m totally amenable to it. I\u2019m not anti-Hollywood, but I think that the strength of what we do \u2014 and I\u2019ll point to The Walking Dead being a great example \u2014 is if you have a property that you feel strongly about, you\u2019ve got a little more leverage now than you may have had in the past to, say, make it faithful to the source material, or else go find some other place to buy something. Look, I\u2019m totally fine because it doesn\u2019t change the medium. Even if somebody did do Empire and decide to settle in the Old West and I had no control over it, Empire still exists as my baby and Barry Kitson\u2019s baby. It doesn\u2019t change that. If Hollywood wants to come knocking, I\u2019ll answer the door, but we need to be talking my language, not theirs.\n","Title":"A chat with the award-winning writer who's perfecting the art of digital comics | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment","sdcc-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5695384","2719053"]}
