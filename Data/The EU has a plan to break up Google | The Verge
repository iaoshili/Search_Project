{"Main text":"The EU has a plan to break up Google\nEurope's parliament is prepared to throw down with the search giant\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle has been the target of repeated anti-trust scrutiny in Europe over the last decade. Today Financial Times is reporting that the European parliament is on the verge of taking even more drastic steps, preparing a plan that would call for the break up of the search giant, specifically the \"unbundling [of] search engines from other commercial services.\"\nGoogle won't divulge its secret sauce\nIt was only five months ago that Google began removing links in response to Europe's new rules about the  \"right to be forgotten.\" The company has been criticized repeatedly, both for its commercial dominance and in regards to privacy. As Financial Times notes, the European parliament has no authority to force the break up of a company like Google, but does have the ability to sway new legislation, which might impact the search giant.\nWhen asked by Financial Times why a drastic measure like a break-up was necessary, Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish member of the EU parliment who sponsored the motion, said the commission could not \"ask the secret of [Google\u2019s] algorithm\" and was seeking other remedies to curb its power.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
