{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEmbedded above is a music video for Ty Segall's \"Manipulator.\" But that's not the way to experience this. Instead,Â  head over to Segall's page and, after a few minutes of loading, get ready to click anything and everything in this so-called \"interactive music video.\" There are three scenes in all, and more than a dozen things to alter in each scene. According to designer Simon Wiscombe, \"all in all there are about 3.1 * 10^31 different combinations.\"\nSo let's give it a shot.\nWiscombe says this scene has 19 different things you can click to change. So let's click on the poster, the wall, the curtains, and now the window here...\nLooking good, looking good. Now what if I click on Segall\u2014\nWhat the hell is going on \u2014 and who is that woman in the window?\nShe's looking right at me. There's sadness in those eyes. She sees me on the other side of the this screen. She knows I keep clicking on the window. I keep summoning a weird, triangular UFO that blows her up, and then with one click I bring her back to life, only to blow her up all over again. There she is, just looking at me. Asking me to stop. To spare her. Just this once.\nShe's judging me. I deserve to be judged.\nBut okay, new scene \u2014 I wasn't ready to move on, but the song made me. Maybe things won't get as weird this time.\nGODDAMMIT WHAT IS GOING ON.\nNOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE.\nDON'T JUDGE ME! I'M SORRY!\n","Title":"This 'interactive music video' will haunt your dreams | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","tldr","watch-this","entertainment"]}
