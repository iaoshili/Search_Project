The test flight will commence with a sunrise liftoff in a first attempt to ready the spacecraft to eventually be used to carry people to Mars in future decades. If NASA is ultimately successful with Orion in future, it will mark the agency\u2019s first crewed spacecraft since the Space Shuttle back in 1981. Though no people are aboard, some precious cargo is: a cookie from Sesame Street's Cookie Monster .\nThe first launch time was 7:05AM ET, but a boat in launch exclusion area delayed it. The next launch time was 7:17AM, \u2014 but the ground winds were too strong, and the launch was pushed back again. A third launch time was given as 7:55, but it too was delayed by wind. So, the launch was rescheduled to 8:26, but was held yet again after a fill and drain valve on the rocket malfunctioned. The valves will be cycled, and then NASA will try again.\nThe craft has a launch window that will close at 9:44AM There's still time for Orion to blast off today.\nUpdate December 4th, 9:44AM: The Orion launch has been scrubbed for the day because of valve problems in the rocket's boosters. The agency says it will try again tomorrow (Friday) at 7:05AM ET.\n","Title":"Watch the launch of NASA\u2019s new Orion spacecraft | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
