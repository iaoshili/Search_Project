{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast year, Enrico Dini used his D-Shape 3D printer to create rather stunning stone buildings out of sand. Now, the Italian inventor is taking his initiative one step further, collaborating with Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars to build the \"Landscape House\" \u2014 a beautiful, one-piece building to be constructed entirely from 3D printing.\nRuijssenaars, of Universe Architecture in Amsterdam, told 3ders.org that he and artist Rinus Roelofs designed the house as \"one surface folded in an endless MÃ¶bius band.\" The architect plans to construct the house from 6 x 9 meter fragments printed from the D-Shape . Ruijssenaars acknowledged having concerns over whether the D-Shape's sand-based layers would be strong enough to support an entire home, but he plans to work around this by printing only the building's \"contours,\" and strengthening them later with reinforced concrete. The architect expects the project to take about 18 months, and is hoping to complete construction by 2014.\nDeveloped for Europan, a European spatial design competition, the Landscape House was also designed with the Irish coastline in mind. \"The location on the coast is so beautiful that we want the design to reflect the nature,\" Ruijssenaars said. \"Landscapes are endless and our question was whether we can design a home that has no beginning and no end.\"\n","Title":"Dutch architect to build gorgeous 'Landscape House' using 3D printer | The Verge","Tags":["culture","design","architecture"]}
