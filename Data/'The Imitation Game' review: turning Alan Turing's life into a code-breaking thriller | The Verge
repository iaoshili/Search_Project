That seems to be the big appeal of going to see a movie about one, and there happens to be two this month alone \u2014 both focusing on hugely important British scientists. The latest is about Alan Turing, a mathematician who was among the early pioneers of computer science. That might not sound all that glamorous, but his life was actually quite dramatic: he\u2019s one of the most important World War II codebreakers and was later persecuted for his sexuality to a tragic end.\nTuring\u2019s life during World War II is the subject of The Imitation Game, a new movie from director Morten Tyldum. Tyldum is a relatively unknown director from Norway, and this is his first film in English. He frames The Imitation Game as a thriller, presenting the story of Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, as he attempts to crack Germany's Enigma machine \u2014 an encryption device that\u2019s preventing the Allies from reading any Nazi messages. It\u2019s a story of espionage, just with math instead of guns.\nBut while the film broadly covers the process of breaking Enigma, the movie\u2019s heart is really Turing himself. The film has two central mysteries \u2014 both expressed quite clearly to the viewer \u2014 and they\u2019re exactly what you\u2019d want to know walking into the theater: who is Alan Turing, and how did he crack one of the greatest encryption devices ever made?\nOn its own, the process of cracking Enigma is not very compelling. It\u2019s a matter of engineering and drafting plans for machinery \u2014 abstract processes that don\u2019t make for an engaging story. Instead, The Imitation Game turns to Turing himself to keep the process interesting. For one, Turing\u2019s a genius, and it\u2019s fascinating to learn how he operates. But it turns out that Turing is a pretty unusual guy, too. He\u2019s removed and unsociable. He\u2019s smarter than everyone else in the room, but sometimes, he just totally doesn\u2019t get it. The Imitation Game lets us watch as Turing and those around him come to deal with how incapable he is of balancing his genius and his inability to get along with others. Ultimately, the challenge of cracking Enigma comes down to whether Turing can open up to his colleagues to get the help and fortitude that he needs, and that\u2019s a conflict worth watching.\nTuring himself is framed as the biggest puzzle of the movie\nThere\u2019s also another defining struggle of Turing\u2019s life: that he is a gay man at a time when gay sex is illegal. This is presented as an underlying challenge for Turing in this film \u2014 something that he is not always contending with, but is often present \u2014 and it is naturally a critical aspect of Turing to explore given his conviction for \"indecency\" later in life.\nThe Imitation Game explores this in a few different ways. The first is in Turing\u2019s growing friendship with Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley, a fellow codebreaker who is among the few people that understand him. She\u2019s able to do this because she, too, is often the odd one out: a woman in a man\u2019s world, and someone who is doing far more incredible things than anyone expected of her. On her own, Clarke provides a wonderful, lighthearted aside to Turing\u2019s seriousness. (She also throws down a man or two who\u2019s too dumb to realize how smart she is, which is pretty great.) But mostly, she\u2019s there to help us see into Turing, giving him the opportunity to talk to someone on his level. His interest in her is also a constant pressure on him, slowly forcing Turing to contend with the fact that he does not truly want to be with her romantically.\nThe movie also explores Turing and his struggles as a gay man by drawing comparisons between him and the machine that he\u2019s building to crack Engima, neither being something that anyone else can fully understand. It\u2019s funny, of course, because Turing\u2019s most iconic idea is a test that asks you to tell the difference between a machine and a human. And, at least in the world of this film, Turing would perhaps be accidentally judged as a machine because he\u2019s so strange. It ultimately makes for a weak and muddled metaphor, the point being that he\u2019s actually human \u2014 just one a bit different than everyone else. The film uses that metaphor to espouse some feel-good sentiments that don\u2019t play as well as it would like, but it\u2019s still a clever enough way of giving insight into Turing.\nThe machine metaphor keeps going. In Turing\u2019s mind, the war is about machines. Whenever the film cuts away from England to show the war, all we see are tanks, battleships, and submarines. It\u2019s Turing\u2019s machine versus theirs, and his is perhaps the most important of the war. Because of that, we see Turing grow obsessed with his own machine \u2014 it is the one thing he allows himself to grow an attachment to during his adult life. Only when something comes between the two of them does Turing really start to break down.\nIt\u2019s in those moments of crisis that the film shines. Cumberbatch plays Turing as calm and poised, but it\u2019s here that he\u2019s suddenly free to give us his all. Otherwise, Cumberbatch presents Turing as the mystery that he\u2019s supposed to be, at least for the sake of this film. He walks a fine line between genius and oddball, between commanding a conversation and blustering his way through one. Cumberbatch never lets us know what side Turing actually lands on, and that\u2019s part of the fun.\nThe film is a thriller, but it all comes down to letting Cumberbatch perform\nBeyond that, the movie builds the intricate plot of a thriller all around Cumberbatch\u2019s character. It\u2019s no accident that this movie has the word \"game\" in its title \u2014 though we only sort of see the Imitation Game, a precursor to the Turing Test, played during the movie, just about everything else in it is framed as a puzzle or a game. Cracking Enigma is laid out with specific rules, and there are ticking clocks everywhere. It\u2019s nothing you haven\u2019t seen before \u2014 when one character asks for a six-month extension, you just know that he's going to hear back something along the lines of a stern \"you've got six weeks\" \u2014 but they all coalesce to form an ongoing sense of tension.\nA lesser film would probably go so far as to explain that Turing is the true enigma that needs to be cracked. Fortunately, while that may be this film\u2019s conceit, it is not so blunt with how it draws his character. Cumberbatch is thrown into the middle of a functional thriller and given the leeway to show us Turing and how a genius and a troubled man works. It\u2019s pretty great to watch him do just that.\n","Title":"'The Imitation Game' review: turning Alan Turing's life into a code-breaking thriller | The Verge","Tags":["culture","review","movie-reviews","entertainment"]}
