{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLyft, the app that connects anyone with a car to people willing to pay for a ride, was supposed to go live in New York City Friday night, hours before a massive Brooklyn launch party. The launch was highly publicized, and Lyft promised two weeks of free rides to introduce New Yorkers to the service.\nUnfortunately for the San Francisco-based company, the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission and the state attorney general immediately dragged Lyft into court and put the kibosh on the launch . Lyft is not permitted to operate in its planned markets of Brooklyn, Queens, Rochester, and Buffalo until it can hammer out a deal with the authorities that regulate the taxi industry.\nIt could be a while before New Yorkers can actually use Lyft. It took competitor Uber a year to negotiate a deal with the city regulators for its taxi-hailing app.\nBut the venue was already booked and hundreds of guests had already RSVP'ed. Lyft put up a blog post explaining the situation and threw a launch party anyway.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nA small group of taxi and livery drivers stood next to the line for the party, shouting slogans like, \u201CLyft out of New York!\u201D They say they are concerned about public safety and competition from uncertified drivers.\nNancy Soria from the New York Association of Independent Taxi Drivers explains the Lyft threat to a passing livery car driver. \u201CThis is really drastic for our industry and the safety of New Yorkers,\u201D she tells The Verge. \u201CIt can create a lot of havoc on our livelihood and we feel they should pack up and leave.\u201D\nOnce inside the party, pink mustaches were everywhere.\nA couple shows off their Lyft staches.

Those who had used it in California or another city were fans. Lyft's hoping to get enough public support to carry it through regulatory hurdles.\nThe party included performances by Golden Pony and Q-Tip as well as free beer and icy treats from Brooklyn-based People's Pops.\nThe Chalk Car, created by Lyft driver Grant Gordon, will be in New York all week. Gordon, who has been driving for a year in San Francisco, is making a documentary about the sharing economy.\nThe party started at 10PM and wound down around 1AM.\n","Title":"Lyft's failure-to-launch party | The Verge","Tags":["policy","photo-essay","us-world","tech"]}
