{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWelcome to Price Check, our weekly post dedicated to sorting through all the new products and deals that we find. We also get a ton of gadgets sent to our office, so consider this the best place for us to tell you about them and where you can find them \u2014 sometimes even for cheap.\nApple iPad Air\nWhat was once our pick for the best tablet you can buy is getting a big price drop today. Best Buy is selling the original Apple iPad Air for $80 off, lowering it close to impulse-buy territory. It may be a little older, but it's still got Apple's Retina screen and great app ecosystem.\nApple iPad Air at Best Buy ($319)\nParrot Zik 2.0\nTruly affordable Bluetooth headphones that actually sound great aren't quite here yet, but if you have the money to spend a great option is the Parrot Zik 2.0 headphones. They come with a companion EQ app, which true audiophiles would probably scoff at, but will at least make you think you know what you're doing.\nParrot Zik 2.0 at Amazon ($399)\nGrand Theft Auto V\nThe latest GTA is finally out for Xbox One and Playstation 4, and the first person mode looks insane . Like last year, you can jump a bike onto a moving train or fly a helicopter around the big world of San Andreas, but the new version lets you hop in and out of the character's POV as much or little as you want while you do all those crazy things. Plus, the bump in graphics has the game looking even better .\nGrand Theft Auto V at Amazon ($59)\nMisfit Shine\nThe one cool thing about the Misfit Shine is it's adaptable \u2014 it can be worn on your wrist, around your neck, or hang out in your pocket. If that's what you're looking for in a fitness tracker, Amazon's selling it for 20% off today. Otherwise, you're going to find more functionality with something like the Jawbone Up24 or even the Garmin Vivofit .\nMisfit Shine at Amazon ($79)\nHP Officejet Pro 8610\nHome printers are obsolete. There's not much you need to print from your living room that you can't just print at work or at a FedEx store. But on the off chance you're just dying to print out dozens of selfies or you fall through a wormhole and need to fax something, this $99 printer will get the job done \u2014 until it inevitably breaks. The price jumps back to $200 tomorrow, and at that point you're better off waiting in line at FedEex.\n","Title":"Price Check: get Apple's original iPad Air for $80 off, play GTA V for $59 | The Verge","Tags":["good-deals","tech"]}
