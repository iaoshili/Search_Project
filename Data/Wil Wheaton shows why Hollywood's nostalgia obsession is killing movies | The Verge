{"Main text":"Wil Wheaton shows why Hollywood's nostalgia obsession is killing movies\n'Literally Everything Else From Your Childhood: The Movie' trailer highlights worrying Hollywood trend\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDo you remember the past? Hollywood is really hoping that you do \u2014 it's much too difficult to appeal to human beings on a shared emotional level. Much easier to simply make reference to a toy popular when the largest movie-consuming demographic was young and hope that draws in the millions. This obsession with nostalgia has been particularly pronounced in recent years, neatly emphasized by the upcoming release of a  gritty-fied movie version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the success of Michael Bay's  brain-melting Transformers franchise .\nWil Wheaton skewers the phenomenon perfectly  in his new video , a trailer for fictitious title Literally Everything Else From Your Childhood: The Movie. The trailer simply reels off a collection of '80s and '90s favorites including Bop It, Lunchables, and the concept of blowing into a video game cartridge, but if current trends continue to escalate, the joke concept could be optioned into a real movie one day \u2014 with Worm Thing Filled With Water That Slipped Through Your Hands in the lead role.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
