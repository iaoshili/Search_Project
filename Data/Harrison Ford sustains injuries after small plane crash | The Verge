Around 2:30PM PT the actor's plane crashed at the Penmar Gold Course near Venice, California. In  audio obtained by TMZ , you can hear Ford report \"engine failure\" to the Santa Monica Airport control tower, announcing \"immediate return.\"\nAccording to NBC News he suffered lacerations to the head and potentially fractures, but authorities are now characterizing his injuries as \"fair to moderate.\" Ford's own son Ben posted his own update to Twitter, saying his father was \"Battered, but ok!\"\nAt the hospital. Dad is ok. Battered, but ok! He is every bit the man you would think he is. He is an incredibly strong man.\n\u2014 Chef Ben Ford (@ChefBenFord) March 6, 2015\nFord was treated at the site of the incident and transported to a local hospital where he is currently receiving treatment.

According to reports \u2014 and several pictures that made their way online \u2014 the aircraft in question was a single-engine plane. The incident isn't the first time the actor has dealt with a crash; in 1999 he was in a helicopter with an instructor when the aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing. Ford, 73, also  broke his leg last year while shooting Star Wars: The Force Awakens. That injury sidelined him from shooting, though the film  took a two-week hiatus and was able to resume after Ford's injury healed. The actor is next scheduled to begin shooting the  long-awaited sequel to Blade Runner in 2016, under the guidance of director Denis Villeneuve.\nUpdate, 7:45PM ET: The post has been updated with Harrison Ford's latest condition per the Los Angeles Fire Department.\nUpdate, 8:20PM ET: Added Ben Ford's tweet.\n","Title":"Harrison Ford sustains injuries after small plane crash | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
