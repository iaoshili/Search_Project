{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvery week, a veritable flood of new music is released to the world, and with it the tyranny of choice rears its ugly head. There's only so many hours in the day, so where do you focus your listening energies? That's where our Verge New Music Recommendations come in: it's our entirely subjective, non-comprehensive attempt to throw the favorite new songs and albums we've stumbled upon this week your way. Of course, we're barely skimming the surface here \u2014 feel free to throw any auditory discoveries you've made this week in the comments, and get busy listening.\nThe Barr Brothers \u2014 \"Static Orphans\" \/ \"Love Ain't Enough\"\nThe Barr Brothers have quite the winding origin story. Brothers Andrew and Brad started the jazz-fusion jam band The Slip late last century, and then the band hit its peak with an  incredibly accessible and beautiful move into indie rock on 2006\u2019s Eisenhower. Unfortunately, The Slip never recorded another album, but Andrew and Brad put together a new project under their shared name. Nothing released under The Barr Brothers moniker has matched the heights of Eisenhower, in my opinion, but the opening duo of songs from the group\u2019s latest record Sleeping Operator comes closest. The two songs flow as one continuous piece of music and sound like a gentler, more folky version of The Slip \u2014 but with the same unmistakably unique attention to building a song up from minimal pieces. The resulting construction always ends up being hard to get out of your head, and \"Love Ain\u2019t Enough\" is no exception.  \u2014 Nathan Ingraham\nCaribou \u2014 Our Love\nHere\u2019s your headphones album for the week. Caribou mastermind Dan Snaith is always keeping himself busy, releasing albums under a variety of monikers, but this is the first proper Caribou record since 2010\u2019s Swim. Like its predecessor, Our Love is a mesmerizing blend of drum machines, oddball electronic sounds, cut-up vocals, and other minimalist instrumental pieces that end up coming together in a way that feels a lot bigger than you\u2019d expect. Standout tracks include the title track and \"Back Home,\" but this is really best heard as one continuous piece of music. It\u2019ll be the perfect thing to wake up to this Sunday morning.  \u2014 N.I.\nCreepers \u2014 Lush\nSan Francisco-based Creepers are a lot more accessible than their name (or the rotting skull artwork on their new album Lush) would have you believe. It\u2019s a surprisingly tuneful psychedelic \/ shoegaze affair, and while the vocals aren\u2019t always quite hooky enough to carry some of the songs, the walls of melodic guitar are more than enough to make up for it. It\u2019s certainly a friendlier face than the one put on by Shiv Mehra and Daniel Tracy main project, the black metal band Deafhaven.  \u2014 N.I.\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http:\/\/allblackrecordingcompany.bandcamp.com\/album\/creepers-lush\" mce_href=\"http:\/\/allblackrecordingcompany.bandcamp.com\/album\/creepers-lush\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Creepers - Lush by All Black Recording Company&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;\/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\nThe Dead Weather \u2014 \"Buzzkill(er)\"\nIt\u2019s been well over four years since The Dead Weather, one of Jack White\u2019s numerous side projects, released a full-length album. Supposedly, there\u2019s a new one coming in 2015, and the band has just released the first single from its next release. \"Buzzkill(er)\" doesn\u2019t stray far from the stomping, blues-driven sound that is the hallmark of most of White\u2019s projects \u2014 in fact, it actually feels a bit more straightforward than most of the songs on their 2010 release Sea of Cowards. As someone who enjoys White\u2019s musical stylings but doesn\u2019t really care for his voice, the combo of the group's bluesy songwriting with Alison Mosshart\u2019s vocals is a winning combo for me. \u2014 N.I.\nDrake \u2014 \"6 God\"\nDrake can always be counted on to impress even with we\u2019re laughing at (with?) him. Mr. Champagne Papi dropped three surprise tracks last week, and the best track is probably \"6 God.\" Don\u2019t get us wrong, the other two are great. But the fact that this braggadocious little single features a sample from Donkey Kong Country 2 is what really sets it apart.  \u2014 Kwame Opam\nFugazi \u2014 \"Merchandise\" (1988 demo)\nFugazi, those DIY champions of the hardcore \/ punk world, have been on hiatus since 2003, but the band has put an exceptional effort into cataloging every phase of their career \u2014 the band eventually wants to release a recording of every single concert they ever performed. Now, the band is looking even further back \u2014 Fugazi will release its first demo tapes from 1988 in November. As a preview, check out this original demo version of \"Merchandise\" from the band's classic first album Repeater. Now granted, Fugazi\u2019s always been a fairly low-fi band, and as such the demo here doesn\u2019t sound significantly different from where the final version ended up \u2014 but it\u2019s still a great inside peek of the band taking its first steps together in the studio.  \u2014 N.I.\nRestorations \u2014 \"Tiny Prayers\"\nThis Philadelphia band\u2019s LP3 is the rock record I thought we weren\u2019t going to get this year: giant, tuneful, and frickin\u2019 loud. \"Tiny Prayers\" is as good a place to start as any, as singer Jon Loudon howls like an orc wounded in battle about how isolated he feels. The circular guitar riff will lodge in your head, and the drums will make you wonder when you can see this band live.  \u2014 Casey Newton\nTaylor Swift \u2014 1989\nLook, just skip the first track. 1989 is Taylor Swift\u2019s first \"official\" pop album and is likely to sell over one million copies in just a week. But it gets off to an awful start with \"Welcome to New York,\" an opener that\u2019s by-the-numbers and woefully bland. The Village Voice aptly describes it as a \"lab-engineered New York anthem.\" Thankfully once you\u2019ve jumped over it, you\u2019ll realize 1989 doesn\u2019t contain many other misfires.\nStarting with \"Blank Space,\" Swift delivers just what you\u2019d expect: a string of infectious hooks and soon-to-be hit singles. \"Style\" is the standout, so it\u2019s no surprise that Target has already latched onto it for a commercial. There\u2019s not a trace of Nashville on 1989; this is no country-pop crossover. 1989 is a tight package of formulaic pop laced with synths and flashy vocal production at every turn. Listen to the first half and you\u2019ll get pulled into its melodies \u2014 but the second half can\u2019t quite hold up. Regardless, 1989 will almost definitely become 2014\u2019s biggest album and help recharge a sagging music industry. Putting all that aside, it\u2019s also a perfectly listenable collection of pop songs \u2014 if you can shake off the haters and their hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.  \u2014 Chris Welch\n(N.B. - Taylor Swift isn't a fan of streaming music , not even her older catalog , so for now you'll have to get your hands on 1989 the old-fashioned way.)\nTeachers \u2014 \"Cruel Cold Winter\" (basis for Kanye West's \"New Slaves\"\nThere's like two seconds of \"Cruel Cold Winter\" during which you might not know what song you're listening to. This is the song that Kanye West sampled to create the underlying beat for Yeezus\u2019 aggressive and minimalist track \"New Slaves,\" but as you'll quickly see, he didn't take much more than those few opening notes. Still, it's pretty fascinating to hear what inspired West (and, I suppose, what didn't).  \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes\n","Title":"New music recommendations: The Dead Weather, Restorations, and, yes, Taylor Swift | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
