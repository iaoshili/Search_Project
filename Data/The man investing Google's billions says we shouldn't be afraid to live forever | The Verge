{"Main text":"The man investing Google's billions says we shouldn't be afraid to live forever\nGoogle Ventures' chief Bill Maris believes life science and health are tech's most exciting sectors\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle Ventures, the investment arm tasked with spending the search giant's billions on exciting new companies, released its annual report last night. Interestingly, the majority of its money did not go into the areas of consumer internet services, mobile apps, and enterprise software that Google is best known for. Instead, of the $1.6 billion it has under management, it put a whopping 35 percent of its new bets in 2014 into the category of life sciences and health, way up from less than 10 percent in the two years prior. So we hopped on the phone with Bill Maris , the managing partner who helped create Google Ventures, to get his take on why life science is such an exciting area and what lies ahead in 2015.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nSo what is it about health and life sciences that is so exciting to Google Ventures right now?\nI think that\u2019s where the future is, the future of everything important. What\u2019s more important than your health? For the first time really in history, we have the tools, especially in the life sciences, to really pursue any vision around healthcare that you are audacious and tenacious enough to pursue.\n\"Healthcare is becoming part of information technology.\"\nHealthcare is becoming part of information technology. The acceleration we saw in computers from 1960 until now is an acceleration we\u2019re going to see in the life sciences, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s a huge opportunity. And not just for making money. You make a great investment in the consumer internet, maybe you make a lot of money and create something useful, interesting, or fun. But in life sciences you have a chance to be part of something that lets people live longer and healthier and not lose the people they care about. That is really profound.\nFlatiron Health is a great example. Two ex-Googlers who sold a company in digital advertising space, then remade themselves as oncology experts, trying to apply the same tools around ingesting and analyzing unstructured data to gain insights they did in advertising, and apply that to cancer. They have built a very fast-growing company. One in five cancer patients whether they know it or not, are involved withÂ  Flatiron Health . They help doctors make better recommendations for treatment by looking across the vast amount of information they have gathered on other cases. It\u2019s one of the very few companies we put a nine-digit number into, $130 million, because the future is so bright for them. 20 years ago you didn\u2019t have the ability to ingest and organize that information in the cloud, the tools simply didn\u2019t exist.\nIs there still a push and pull between tech and healthcare? My recent visits to the doctor are still full of paper records and information that can\u2019t be easily shared between providers.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a push and pull, I think it\u2019s push push. There is so much acceleration that can happen now that these tools exist. In 2000 you couldn\u2019t sequence a genome, maybe for a billion dollars and over five years. Now you can do it on your desktop in an hour for a couple hundred dollars. That one genome is a huge achievement, but only in the network, in the context of all the genomes you can sequence, does its real value come through. Now we are at the point where we can sequence millions, billions of genomes, and we can take the first step which is to start to diagnose the markers of diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's which we think might have genetic causes.\n\"For me it\u2019s like the difference between blood-letting and penicillin.\"\nThe huge gulf between 2000 and now, we are going to cross an even bigger gulf in the next 10 years where we will learn so much about the way your body works. For me it\u2019s like the difference between blood-letting and penicillin. Ok, we have no clue what\u2019s going on so we\u2019re just going to bleed it out of you because we don\u2019t know what else to do. Versus, here is a pill, and if you take this you won\u2019t die. That is such a huge difference that happened in such a short amount of time. That\u2019s what we\u2019re about to see again.\nSay you have cancer, you have this broad thing we call cancer, we\u2019re going to irradiate you, and pump this poisonous material into you and hope more of the bad stuff dies than the good. That is going to seem so medieval when we can fix it on a genetic level, and Foundation Medicine is the first step to diagnosing it on a genetic level. Not just, you have breast cancer, but what exactly is going on in the that tumor. That is step one. You can see the path ahead to personalize medicine for people.\nGoing one step beyond curing disease, Google is now working on the incredibly ambitious project of curing death. How are you involved with Project Calico?\nCalico was my idea. I\u2019m super proud of it. It came from a thesis I had that no one was studying aging at the genetic level. What is aging, versus the diseases we associate with aging.\nWhat\u2019s the response from people in the mainstream when you discuss this with them? Do people push back against that as unnatural? What do you think of people who say it\u2019s going to far?\nThose are people who probably haven\u2019t died yet, for sure, but maybe haven\u2019t had someone really close to them die. Certainly I respect the different point of view, but I feel like the \"natural state\" used to be that you would die in your 30s or 40s. You would lose all your teeth, and that was \"natural.\" New ideas are scary.\nIf you said to most people in 1900, would you like to live to be 100, they would have said no thank you, it seems to so unimaginably bad. Now people expect to live to be 70 or 80, and if you asked if they wanted to live to 100 most would probably say yes. Now ask them if they want to live to 200 and most would say, I don\u2019t know about that. But the reality is if you were going to die tomorrow and someone offered you another 10 years, most people would take those 10 years.\n\"It\u2019s not about scary immortality.\"\nAnd the beauty of it is you can always opt out. If you don\u2019t want that extra time, you can always opt out of the system, but I don\u2019t have an interest in opting out of the system, nor do I want the people that I love opting out. It\u2019s not about scary immortality. What if your grandmother didn\u2019t have to die of congestive heart failure or some debilitating stroke where she can\u2019t move half her body? Wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing? I find that generally when I can talk to people about it and take some of the scary unknown away it becomes less intimidating.\n","Title":"The man investing Google's billions says we shouldn't be afraid to live forever | The Verge","Tags":["google","interview","science","tech"]}
