{"Main text":"Steven Spielberg reportedly wants to direct the Indiana Jones reboot\nWith Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt in the title role\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWord has been circling for some time that Disney is mulling a reboot of the Indiana Jones series and wants Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt to take the whip.  Deadline is now reporting that Steven Spielberg himself is interested in stepping behind the camera should all the pieces fall into place.\nIt's remarkably early for this kind of news \u2014 Jeff Sneider of  The Wrap points out that there's no contractual obligation or even script at this point \u2014 but any kind of reboot would certainly gain immediate prestige coming from Spielberg. The filmmaker directed all four of the original films in the series, a run that started back in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. Of course, it also unfortunately included Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, a movie that failed to work in almost every single regard (other than getting Harrison Ford back into costume in the first place).\nThere's no doubt audiences will see a new Indiana Jones eventually\nWhether this configuration of director and star ends up coming to pass, there's no doubt that audiences will eventually see a new Indiana Jones film at some point. Disney obtained some of the rights to the character when it  bought Lucasfilm in 2012 , but Paramount was also in the mix at that time. Disney reportedly closed a deal with Paramount a year later to  get complete control of the franchise . Disney has had great success in building large movie universes with Marvel and is putting the same plan into effect with Star Wars; no doubt they studio sees the same kind of potential in a new Indiana Jones series.\n","Title":"Steven Spielberg reportedly wants to direct the Indiana Jones reboot | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
