{"Main text":"ISIS is waging a terrifying web propaganda war\nThe militants' social media savvy may be inflating the group's numbers and intimidating Iraqi soldiers\nAs Iraq is roiled by militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), eyes have fallen on the terrorist group's propaganda network, a dark corner of the web that the militants hope to exploit for recruitment and intimidation.\nAnother video shows insurgents machine-gunning Iraqi vehicles\nA new report in The Guardian highlights the militants' internet savvy. There is a YouTube film series from ISIS called The Clanging of the Swords, the latest entry of which includes drone footage and apparently real rocket launches. Another video shows insurgents machine-gunning Iraqi vehicles.\nBut maybe more crucial to ISIS's takeover of the country \u2014 it's now sanctioned off large swaths of territory \u2014 are the group's social media tactics, which may have artificially inflated their numbers before strikes. The in-house app The Dawn of Glad Tidings, when downloaded, automatically posts updates on ISIS from the user's personal Twitter account, resulting in a stream of violent images and videos when searching for the group online. One, a picture of a bloodied gun posted to Instagram, includes the text, \"YODO. You only die once. Why not make it martyrdom[?]\"\nThe result is pervasive propaganda. ISIS Photophopped an image of a militant in Baghdad with the words \"Baghdad, we are coming,\" while fears of an attack on the nation's capital were high.  As The Atlantic noted at the time, it was impossible to search \"Baghdad\" on Twitter without the image appearing in the stream. Anecdotally, at least, as reports of  fleeing Iraqi soldiers come in, the strategy may be having an effect.\n","Title":"ISIS is waging a terrifying web propaganda war | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
