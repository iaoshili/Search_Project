{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe know thatÂ  Benedict Cumberbatch will play Doctor Strange in 2016 , but it'll likely be some time before we see him in classic Strange attire. That doesn't mean Marvel and co. can't whet our appetites in the meantime. Director Scott Derrickson took to Twitter early this morning to give fans an early Christmas present in the form of fanart for the film.\n\"Strange but not a stranger\" - Talking Heads pic.twitter.com\/30lPiwfGhk\n\u2014 Scott Derrickson (@scottderrickson) December 22, 2014\nHere we see Cumberbatch as Strange himself, superimposed over what's either a far off galaxy or the astral plane. The line Derrickson references is from the Talking Heads' \"Burning Down the House.\" It turns out the reference might be all too fitting. The full verse is:\nWatch out you might get what you're after\nBoom babies strange but not a stranger\nI'm an ordinary guy\nBurning down the house\nAll we can say at this point is that Derrickson, a noted horror director, can be expected to take Strange to some dark, dangerous places on his journey from ordinary guy to Sorcerer Supreme. Doctor Strange hits theaters on November 4th, 2016.\nUpdate 2:00pm: Scott Derrickson followed up his tweet to clarify that the piece is fanart. We've updated to post to reflect that.\n","Title":"This stunning fanart shows Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
