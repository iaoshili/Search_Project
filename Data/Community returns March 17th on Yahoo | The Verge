The former NBC comedy, which was  picked up for a sixth season by Yahoo , will premiere Tuesday, March 17th with two episodes, followed by one episode each week after that. By our count, that means episode 13 \u2014 the sixth season finale \u2014 will broadcast June 2nd. Plan accordingly.\nYahoo has released a  small promo video announcing the return date, featuring creator Dan Harmon, new cast member Paget Brewster, and returning cast members like Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Jim Rash, Ken Jeong, and Danny Pudi.\n\"After years of it being figuratively the case, we are now literally underneath Parks and Rec.\" Harmon, on the new stage. #TCA15\n\u2014 Todd VanDerWerff (@tvoti) January 13, 2015\nCommunity, which originally premiered on NBC September 17th, 2009, was  canceled last May after its fifth season , which saw Dan Harmon return as show runner after he was  fired at the end of season three . The sixth season will premiere without many of the original cast members, including Donald Glover, Chevy Chase, and Yvette Nicole Brown. The Yahoo release notes that  Jonathan Banks (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul) , who joined last season, and  John Oliver will also be absent. In addition to Brewster, Keith David has been added to the new season lineup.\n. @danharmon on if he has a definite end in mind for the show: \"I have to continue writing the show as if it's going on for 20 seasons.\"\n\u2014 Community (@CommunityTV) January 13, 2015\nThough the show's rallying cry has long been \"six seasons and a movie\" \u2014 and, indeed, Yahoo's post suggests as much \u2014 no film has been confirmed. (Harmon  said last summer that a search for Donald Glover's character Troy is \"what movies are made of.\") So for now, enjoy the sixth season for what it is: 13 new vignettes of Greendale Community College that will start showing up online nine weeks from now.\n","Title":"Community returns March 17th on Yahoo | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","breaking","entertainment"]}
