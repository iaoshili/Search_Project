{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter releasing its first lineup of aggressively priced 4K UHD TVs  last year , Vizio is doubling down with its newest batch. The company's new M-series collection of Smart TVs starts at $599 for a 43-inch set and goes all the way up to $3,999 for the top-of-the-line 80-inch set. As with previous collections, this range is cheap through and through, and shows Vizio fighting hard for mainstream consumers as 4K becomes the standard.\nLike last fall's P-series, the super thin M-series features Full Array LED backlighting, which allows for the even distribution of light across 32 LED zones in the screen's back panel. The sets also include a Spatial Scaling Engine, which upscales 720p and 1080p content to \"near 4K\" resolution (which could prove useful for sports fans and those watching Netflix and Amazon series on the onboard apps).\nCompetition is heating up\nIn the months since Vizio unveiled its 4K lineup, the competition has heated up to get UHD TVs in consumers' homes.  Samsung this month announced the pricing for its \"seductive\" curved SUHD sets that were first unveiled at CES. Starting at $949 for the so-called \"regular\" 40-inch set, the prices are certainly attractive. Still, $599 is hard to beat. The M series is available right now at Best Buy, Walmart, and other outlets.\nVerge Video archive: Vizio P-Series hands-on (2014)\n","Title":"Vizio unveils its latest batch of super cheap 4K TVs | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech"]}
