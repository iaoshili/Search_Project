{"Main text":"Apple makes iWork apps available to users without any Apple devices\nBeta version lets everyone use Pages, Numbers, and Keynote\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple is taking its iWork for iCloud apps multi-platform, turning it into a product accessible to internet users on any device, similar to Google Docs. Where previously to use Apple Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, you needed to own at least one Apple device, you're now able to get an Apple ID and  access the apps without needing your own Mac, iPhone, or iPad.\nUsers need an Apple ID before they can use word processor Pages, spreadsheet app Numbers, and Powerpoint-a-like Keynote. Those who do sign up to use iWork for iCloud apps get 1GB of free storage so they can save files in Apple's apps and access them across different devices even if they only have access to Windows, Android, or Linux machines. For now, the option to use the apps only exists if you sign up on iWork for iCloud's beta site \u2014 Apple has yet to announce plans to expand the feature to the standard version of its iWork apps.\nUsers need an Apple ID to access the apps\nApple made iWork's apps  free to use back in 2013 , removing a host of compatibility issues in the process, but  stripping out a number of features from Pages, Numbers, and Keynote at the same time. The three apps have traditionally been seen as less feature-rich than the programs in Google's Drive and Microsoft's Office suites, but by making iWork truly multi-platform as it also  makes iCloud itself easier to use on different operating systems, Apple is showing that it wants to challenge the market leaders.\n","Title":"Apple makes iWork apps available to users without any Apple devices | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","tech"]}
