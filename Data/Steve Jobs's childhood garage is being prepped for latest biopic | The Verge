{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSteve Jobs' childhood home in Los Altos, California \u2014 which became a historic site in 2013 \u2014Â is opening up for cameras once again. Film crews began setting up shop there today to begin dressing the location in anticipation of shooting the latest film about Apple's co-founder, reports CNET. The house and its garage served as Apple's early and rather humble beginnings, and were depicted briefly in 2013's film Jobs. In this case, it's for the second, unrelated film, penned by Aaron Sorkin and based off Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of the late technology pioneer. Some of the early adornments spotted in the garage include things like a Bob Dylan poster and an ad for a Braun coffeemaker.\nBob Dylan posters everywhere\nThe film was set to begin shooting in California sometime this month. A job posting recently spotted by Variety showed that the production company was looking for people who could portray engineers, interns, press, and coffee shop patrons circa the 1980s and 1990s.\nThis latest film has suffered a number of setbacks, including changing hands from Sony Pictures to Universal , as well as reported difficulties finding someone to play Jobs. That spot was ultimately filled by Michael Fassbender, with Slumdog Millionaire's Danny Boyle directing. The other film starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs, and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak. According to earlier interviews with Sorkin , the plot for this film will center around three product launches including the first Mac, the NeXT cube, and the iPod.\n","Title":"Steve Jobs's childhood garage is being prepped for latest biopic | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
