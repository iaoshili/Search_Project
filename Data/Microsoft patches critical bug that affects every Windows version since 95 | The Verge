{"Main text":"Microsoft patches critical bug that affects every Windows version since 95\nA 19-year-old flaw\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft has patched a critical flaw in Windows that has existed in every version since the introduction of Windows 95 more than 19 years ago. IBM security researchers discovered the flaw earlier this year and notified the software giant privately in May. The rare bug allows attackers to remotely execute code on an affected system just by convincing Windows users to visit a URL in Internet Explorer. IBM says the exploit can be triggered on Internet Explorer 3.0 onwards, and every currently supported version of Windows is affected.\n\"This vulnerability has been sitting in plain sight for a long time despite many other bugs being discovered and patched in the same Windows library,\" says IBM researcher Robert Freeman. While Microsoft is providing patches for Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Vista, and its various server releases, the companyÂ  stopped supporting Windows XP earlier this year so consumers will not be protected if attackers attempt to exploit the bug. There\u2019s no evidence this bug is being exploited in the wild yet, but it has been rated 9.3 out of 10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) so it\u2019s well worth patching through Windows Update if you haven\u2019t already.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
