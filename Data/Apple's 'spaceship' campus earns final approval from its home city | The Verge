{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple has received final approval for its planned \"spaceship\" campus from the city of Cupertino. The city council gave its formal approval in a vote on Tuesday, after it had  unanimously agreed to the construction of the 176-acre California campus in October. Construction will begin with the demolition of the Hewlett-Packard office buildings currently on site later this year.\nBy agreeing to build the so-called Campus 2,  CNET reports Apple will enter into a 20-year-long development agreement with Cupertino, and will increase the amount of tax it pays to the city. Last year Cupertino's council refunded $6.2 million of the $12.7 million in sales tax Apple generated for the city; this year that rebate will be reduced from 50 percent of the tax Apple pays to 35 percent.\nSteve Jobs himself said the campus looked like a \"spaceship\"\nSteve Jobs himself likened the building to a \"spaceship\" in 2011, with its 1,200-foot diameter dish set to house the corporate  world's largest solar array and its open space used to restore native vegetation to Cupertino. The \"spaceship\" had run into turbulence on its way to construction earlier this year when it was reported that the project was  behind schedule and $2 billion over budget . But the Cupertino city council's approval of the campus \u2014 which will start housing Apple employees  by mid-2016 \u2014 was the last major blockage on the way to construction. All that's left for Apple to do is to actually build its new home.\n","Title":"Apple's 'spaceship' campus earns final approval from its home city | The Verge","Tags":["apple","design","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5853926"]}
