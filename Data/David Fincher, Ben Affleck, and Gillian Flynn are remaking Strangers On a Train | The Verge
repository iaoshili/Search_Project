{"Main text":"David Fincher, Ben Affleck, and Gillian Flynn are remaking Strangers On a Train\nThe key team behind Gone Girl is back for more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGone Girl may have been  a singularly depressing and bleak tale , but it was also one of the better movies to come out this year. Now, the core team behind it appears to be teaming up for another film \u2014  according to Deadline , director David Fincher, novelist \/ screenwriter Gillian Flynn, and Ben Affleck are going to bring their talents to a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Strangers On a Train.\nFlynn, who wrote the novel Gone Girl and then adapted it for the screen, will write the screenplay of this adaptation, which will take Hitchcock's 1951 film (itself based on a novel written the year before) and update it for modern times. As such, the plot will be changed a bit (it sounds like Affleck will meet an eccentric millionaire on a private plane, rather than on the titular train) while still retaining ties to the original work.\nThere's no word yet on when the film will be released or even when it might start shooting, but Deadline implies that Warner Bros. is eager to fast-track it given the success of Gone Girl.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
