{"Main text":"Instagram filters out the noise with redesigned logo\nInspired by Kellogg's and Coca-Cola\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nInstagram last week unveiled a slightly redesigned logotype , introducing subtle yet significant changes to its two-year-old design. Released alongside the app's new photo tagging feature , the script was designed by Mackey Saturday, a Denver-based typographer and friend of Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom. As Gizmodo UK reports , Mackey began working on the redesign more than a year ago, redrawing the app's Billabong webfont by hand to create a more elegant alternative. The changes could hardly be described as an overhaul, and may be difficult to discern at first glance (see the graphic, below); but the new design is certainly cleaner and more fluid.\nThe idea, according to Mackey, was to create a logotype that, like other iconic brand designs, would stand the test of time. \"The real goal is to sit alongside some of those timeless scripts, like Kellogg's and Campbell's,\" Mackey told Gizmodo. \"Coca-Cola's another great example. It's nostalgic, but it transcends popular trends.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
