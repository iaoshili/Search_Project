{"Main text":"The MacGyver intro is so much funnier without the theme song\nThe funniest MacGyver-inspired short video since MacGruber\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI'm packing for next week's CES. I have a toothbrush, some toothpaste, a stack of button-up shirts, and a few pairs of pants. But if I were MacGyver I wouldn't need any of this. All I'd need are my wits and what's on my back. Hell, I wouldn't even need to attend CES. The new technology of billion dollar corporations would have nothing on my clump of lent, used razor, and half pound of chewed bubble gum.\nThis version of the MacGyver intro, which replaces the All-American theme song with goofy sound effects, makes me love the character even more. He's like a cross between Indiana Jones, an IT manager, and Dad.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
