{"Main text":"You can thank Netflix for the return of The X-Files\nThe truth is online\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMore than 13 years after its last season and seven years after a pretty forgettable second movie,  The X-Files is coming back to Fox as a six-episode limited series starring original cast members David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson.\nThe X-Files was a huge hit, even if the later seasons got a bit iffy in terms of quality or even logic. The show won 16 Emmy Awards and was nominated 62 times over nine seasons. It spawned two films, two spinoff TV shows (The Lone Gunmen and Millennium, sort of \u2014  there was a crossover episode ), various comic book series, and countless fan fiction. Fun fact: the term \"shipper\" is attributed to X-Files fans who really wanted to see Mulder and Scully hook up, and is now use to describe fan-craved relationships from Harry and Louis to Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.\nNostalgia is a powerful emotion. As a species, we tend to remember things more fondly than they ever could have been. For a network, that means reviving old properties will have a built-in audience. It's a safer bet, financially speaking, and the success of  last year's 24: Live Another Day miniseries proved it. In some ways, you can thank Jack Bauer for Mulder and Scully's return.\nAbove all else, however, you can thank Netflix for The X-Files. Back when \" Kevin Spacey's bad Southern accent \" meant Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Big Red was primarily a haven for people to binge-watch old favorites or discover shows they missed the first time around. (It arguably still is; even if Netflix's marketing push is aimed at its original content, the company spends millions to secure syndication rights of shows  like Friends and  The Blacklist .) Binge-watching saved Family Guy. It saved Futurama \u2014 twice. The X-Files remains a known quantity, and that makes it viable.\nIt's been 13 years, hope my suits still fit. #XFilesReunion http:\/\/t.co\/T8Yx6J8a5m pic.twitter.com\/L1ZM9BzXCr\n\u2014 David Duchovny (@davidduchovny) March 25, 2015\nSo yes, The X-Files is coming back, and it really doesn't matter to Fox if it's good or bad because there's already a whole internet's worth of a fans eager for something new. And if it isn't The X-Files,  it's Twin Peaks . Or it's Boy Girl Meets World.  It's even Heroes , even though that show had maybe five good episodes and three and a half seasons worth of bad ones.\nDo you ever wonder what the Gilmore Girls are up to right now? Keep binge-watching old seasons, and you just might find out.\n","Title":"You can thank Netflix for the return of The X-Files | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
