Judd Apatow, now one of the world's comedy treasures thanks to hits like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, was 22 years old and hoping for a gig. He wrote a spec script for the show, but never heard back. Next week, the results of that script will finally be seen.\nApatow wrote a spec script at 22, but never heard back\nApatow  announced in 2012 that his long-lost script was being produced, and ahead of the episode's release, he  opened up to TV guide about the process. When asked about the re-reading the script, Apatow said, \"I had funny instincts. That's about all. It's a pretty rough script \u2014 when I reread it I wasn't exactly glowing with pride \u2014 but Al [Jean] and the staff did their Simpsons magic on it.\"\nThe episode, called \"Bart's New Friend,\" does sound like a classic Simpsons plot: Homer is hypnotized into thinking he's 10 years old, and after becoming buds with Bart, doesn't want to go back to adulthood. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly last year, Apatow also explained why he wanted to return to the script. \"The reason I brought up The Simpsons episode is because I realized while doing this interview that everything I had ever written was the premise of the first thing I had ever written,\" he said. \"All of my stories are about people trying hard not to grow up.\"\nThe episode is set to air January 11th at 8PM ET on Fox.\n","Title":"Judd Apatow's 25-year-old Simpsons script will finally air next week | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
