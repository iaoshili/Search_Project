{"Main text":"Iran moves forward with death penalty over Facebook posts\nSupreme Court upholds hanging sentence for Soheil Arabi, drawing renewed attention to Iran's notorious human rights record\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA 30-year-old blogger and photographer has been sentenced to death in Iran for \"insulting the prophet of Islam\" on Facebook, drawing renewed attention to the country's notorious human rights record. The man, Soheil Arabi, was  convicted in a Tehran criminal court in August after admitting to posting the defamatory content. His lawyers argued that he had done so while  \"in poor psychological condition,\" according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, and that he was merely sharing views held by others. But Iran's Supreme Court  upheld the conviction late last month and went a step further by adding a charge of \"sowing corruption of Earth.\" This charge is also punishable by death and cannot be pardoned, according to Arabi's lawyer.\n\"Currently, there is no pardon.\"\nHuman Rights Watch this week  called on the Iranian government to halt Arabi's death sentence, but government officials have shown no sign of leniency. \"Currently, there is no pardon, and he\u2019s been convicted of 'corruption on Earth,'\" Gholam Ali Mohseni Ejei, deputy head of Iran's judiciary,  told reporters Monday. \"But there has been a request for his case to be reviewed again.\"\nIran has long taken a hard stance on online dissent, and appears to have stepped up its efforts in recent months. According to  Reporters Without Borders , at least 65 activists, journalists, and bloggers were currently in prison because of their online activities as of July. In May, seven people were arrested for dancing to the Pharrell Williams song \"Happy\" and publishing the  video online. They were given a suspended  sentence of one year in jail and 91 lashes, on the basis that the video violated Iran's Islamic laws. In July, eight Iranians were  arrested and sentenced to a combined 127 years in jail on charges of colluding against the state and spreading propaganda on Facebook.\nAt the same time, President Hassan Rouhani has  publicly called for a relaxation of Iran's strict internet censorship regime, including its  restrictions on social media . This has put Rouhani at apparent odds with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has stood by the restrictions despite his  prolific Twitter activity .\nNastaran Naimi, Arabi's wife, claims her husband was forced to admit guilt under pressure from agents of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Both she and her husband were arrested in their homes in November 2013, and while Naimi was soon released, Arabi was held in solitary confinement for two months. In a separate case related to the same Facebook posts, he was sentenced to three years in prison on September 4th for \"spreading propaganda against the system\" and \"insulting the leader.\" One of the Facebook pages he operated was  titled \"The generation that no longer wants to be the burned generation.\"\nAccording to  Amnesty International , Arabi's conviction marks the second time that an Iranian has been sentenced to death for insulting the Prophet Mohammed. In August, an engineer named Rouhollah Tavana was  sentenced to death after allegedly insulting the prophet in a video clip. Amnesty, like Human Rights Watch, has called upon the government to halt Arabi's hanging and release him immediately.\n\"It is simply shocking that anyone should face the gallows simply because of Internet postings that are deemed to be crude, offensive, or insulting,\" Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a  statement this week. \"Iran should urgently revise its penal code to eliminate provisions that criminalize peaceful free expression, especially when they punish its exercise with death.\"\n","Title":"Iran moves forward with death penalty over Facebook posts | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
