The ecosystem has grown dramatically since then, culminating in today\u2019s announcement of a bevy of sensors that fills many of the gaps sought by home automators. But unlike most Zigbee or Z-wave networks, a home fitted with WeMo devices can be sure of single vendor compatibility. Belkin\u2019s WeMo Link device acts to bridge the Zigbee sensors to the home\u2019s wireless network. Slowly but surely, the battle for home automation is boiling down to WeMo vs. Wink.\nSlowly but surely, the battle for home automation is boiling down to WeMo vs. Wink\nThe list of new WeMo sensors includes magnetic window and door sensors, a personal keychain sensor that can track a person\u2019s entry or exit from the home, a room motion sensor, and an alarm sensor that sends a notification to smartphones if it detects the siren of an existing security alarm. There\u2019s even a water sensor that Belkin claims provides \"unprecedented insight\" into household water usage from a single sensor that measures pressure change vibrations caused by faucets turning or toilets flushing.\nEach sensor lasts about a year on battery and can be used to trigger other WeMo devices, like tripping a motion sensor lights a WeMo Smart LED bulb, or tripping a window sensor can send an alert to a home owner\u2019s smartphone while on vacation.\nThe WeMo Sensors should hit retail sometime in the second half of 2015 although pricing is still undetermined. WeMo Water is currently in field trials and an availability date has not been decided.\n","Title":"WeMo smart home sensors announced at CES 2015 | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech","ces-2015"]}
