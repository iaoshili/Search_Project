Critics are still unhappy with the new law, which Airbnb describes as \"a great victory.\" Several amendments have reportedly been put forth including proposals to exclude in-law units and limiting room rentals to 90 days or less, all of which have been rejected. Chiu's ordinance will undergo a second vote before it is finally relayed to the mayor's office for a signature.\n","Title":"San Francisco moves towards legalizing Airbnb | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
