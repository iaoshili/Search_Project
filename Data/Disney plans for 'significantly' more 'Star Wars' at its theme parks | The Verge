{"Main text":"Disney plans for 'significantly' more 'Star Wars' at its theme parks\nMay the force be with funky Boba Fett\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been said countless times before but it bears repeating:  Disney did not buy Lucasfilm solely to make Star Wars films. For better and for worse, the Mouse House is far too good at building a larger multimedia universe out of all its various franchises (be it original Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and so on). So don't be surprised at all by Disney CEO Bob Iger's statements this week on a conference call with analysts (according to  Variety ): \"When we grow Star Wars' presence, which we will do significantly, you will see better bets being made that will pay off for us than were made in the past.\"\nHere's a brief tally so far: a  third trilogy directed by J.J. Abrams starting with Episode VII in December 2015,  several standalone films , a new  animated series Rebels , and rest assured countless new toys and video games. And lest we forget, Star Wars has already been a part of Disney's theme parks, from  Star Tours to a  20-minute Jedi Training Academy (Light Side Force users only).
