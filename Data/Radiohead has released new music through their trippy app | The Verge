{"Main text":"Radiohead has released new music through their trippy app\nWork on a new album is supposed to begin this month\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRadiohead have some new music out this week, but it isn't on sale or available for download in any of the usual places. Instead, the band has updated their trippy PolyFauna app with a bunch of new sounds and visuals for the first time since  its release back in February . The app was initially a companion to Radiohead's 2011 album The King of Limbs, warping one of its tracks into an eerie soundtrack while listeners floated through strange landscapes on screen. That's still the case here, except now the app stands a bit more on its own because it's based around a standalone set of tunes. That may not be the case forever, though. Radiohead are planning to head into the studio this month, and this app could be a first taste of what those new recordings will sound like. The app is available  on both iTunes and Google Play .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
