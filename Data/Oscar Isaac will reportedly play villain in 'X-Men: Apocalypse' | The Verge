Isaac could soon join the likes Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Fassbender when the film starts shooting in April of next year.\nIsaac may play the X-Men's most powerful foe yet\nAccording to Variety, Apocalypse will be the most destructive film in the franchise to date \u2014 all too fitting considering its ultra-powerful, ancient Egyptian villain. Taking place in the 1980s, the movie may also feature younger versions of familiar X characters like Jean Grey, and tie together themes from all the films in the series. \"These prequels are really exciting for me because they give me a chance to explore ideas I came up with more than a decade ago,\"  said Singer back in March .\nCasting Isaac is an interesting choice, especially since he's known for earthier fare like Llewyn Davis and A Most Violent Year. Apocalypse, on the other hand, is the kind of mutant who can alter his only molecular make-up and control technology with his mind. However,  Isaac will also appear in the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens , so he'll soon enjoy a higher profile for his more fantastical work.\n","Title":"Oscar Isaac will reportedly play villain in 'X-Men: Apocalypse' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
