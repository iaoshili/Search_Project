{"Main text":"SpaceX pushes Falcon 9 rocket launch to January\nRocket retrieval test and ISS resupply will have to wait\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe SpaceX launch meant to test the process of landing the company's 14-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket on a \"autonomous spaceport drone ship\" in the ocean has been delayed until January 6, according to Reuters . SpaceX spokesperson John Taylor named a problem with the routine pre-launch test firing of the rocket's engine as the reason.\nAccording to article, the engine was lit but did not run the full duration of the test. \"The data suggests we could push forward without a second attempt, but out of an abundance of caution, we are opting to execute a second static fire test prior to launch,\" Taylor told Reuters.\nAside from testing the rocket retrieval process, the mission was also supposed to send cargo to the International Space Station. It's the first resupply mission for the ISS since Orbital Science's Antares rocket exploded six seconds after liftoff back in October. SpaceX also lost a rocket of its own earlier this year, when a test version of the Falcon 9 exploded in mid-air at a facility in Texas.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
