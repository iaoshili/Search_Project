The surveillance program is part of the Drug Enforcement Administration's plan to build a database plotting the movements of vehicles around the country.\nThe program, which scans and records license plates, has been in place for years. A spokesperson for the Justice Department told the Journal that the license plate-reader program is \"not new,\" but where it was previously used to combat drug cartels and seize valuables, it is now being used to solve criminal cases like homicide and kidnapping. DEA documents obtained by the ACLU under the Freedom of Information Act show the license plate-reader program dating back to 2008.\nThe program dates back to 2008\nThis isn't the first time the US government has  spied on its citizens , but now it seems the only prerequisite for being spied on is driving a car.\nJay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU, said of the program, \"It\u2019s unconscionable that technology with such far-reaching potential would be deployed in such secrecy. People might disagree about exactly how we should use such powerful surveillance technologies, but it should be democratically decided, it shouldn\u2019t be done in secret.\"\nThe DEA originally began tracking vehicles near the Mexican border to staunch the flow of narcotics into the US, but has been expanding its surveillance reach throughout the country.\n","Title":"The DEA has been spying on millions of US drivers for years | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","transportation"]}
