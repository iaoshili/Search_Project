{"Main text":"Science\nNew York Ebola patient will check out of the hospital Tuesday\nThe doctor, who contracted the disease while treating patients in Guinea, is well enough to go home on Tuesday\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCraig Spencer , the 33-year-old doctor whose positive test for Ebola made New York unusually panicky , is set to check out of Bellevue Hospital tomorrow, the New York Times reports. Spencer was taken to the hospital by ambulance on October 23 after he reported a fever that morning.\nSpencer had been in Guinea, which has had 1,760 confirmed cases and at least 1,054 deaths as of November 4, according to the CDC. He was with Doctors Without Borders, an international aid organization. After receiving every available treatment \u2014 including an experimental drug and donated plasma from another Ebola patient \u2014 over the course of the last 19 days, he is well enough to leave the hospital. It's not clear whether he will return to his apartment, where his fiance is quarantined, the New York Times says.\nSo far, the U.S. has had four confirmed Ebola cases; only one patient, Thomas Duncan, has died. Duncan was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. , and two nurses were infected while caring for him.\nThough there aren't any active Ebola infections in the U.S. right now, it's still too soon to declare the country Ebola-free. That designation won't occur until 42 days go by without any new cases, according to the World Health Organization's guidelines .\n","Title":"New York Ebola patient will check out of the hospital Tuesday | The Verge","Tags":["science\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
