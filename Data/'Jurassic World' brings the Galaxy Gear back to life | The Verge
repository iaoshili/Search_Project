{"Main text":"'Jurassic World' brings the Galaxy Gear back to life\nSamsung's smartwatch lives on among its kin\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvolution is a brutal and unforgiving mistress. The Jurassic Park movies have always offered a brief escape from its clutches for a few select dinosaur species, but the new Jurassic World is bringing back some deprecated technology as well: the Samsung Galaxy Gear. Though only a year old, this smartwatch has already  had its operating system swapped out and been turned into a freebie to be given away with smartphone purchases. Discarded by its maker and replaced by  newer and better models , the Gear may aptly be regarded as the dinosaur of the fast-developing smartwatch industry.\nOn screen for a mere glimpse during  today's Jurassic World trailer , the Galaxy Gear serves as a wrist-worn radar display. It still carries its signature camera integrated into the strap, so there may be more tricks it can put on show if it gets more screen time in the actual movie. At least the Gear's presence in Jurassic World appears to be subtle, which can't be said of Samsung's gratuitous branding all over  the latest Avengers trailer .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
