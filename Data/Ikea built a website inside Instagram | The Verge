{"Main text":"Ikea built a website inside Instagram\nRussian ad agency exploits mobile app to sell furniture\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTo help push Ikea's  intensely odd PS 2014 collection , the furniture seller's Russian division hired ad agency Instinct to build a marketing campaign within Instagram. Navigating to the Instagram account  ikea_ps_2014 on your smartphone \u2014 it won't format correctly in your browser \u2014 will open up a \"website\" within the app, consisting of 12 images. The account acts as an interactive catalog, divided into Benches, Tables, Storage, Light, Textiles, and Ideas. Clicking through to view either of these images brings up a variety of tags that link to separate pages with more information on each product, such as  ps_side_table and  ps_laptop_station , all similarly arranged to resemble catalog pages. It's one of the more novel uses of Instagram as a free promotional medium, and a fun way to browse Ikea's collection.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
