{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMac vs. PC is always fun. It's a never-ending war of words between Apple fans and Microsoft fans, mixed with tech spec comparisons of GHz, nits, and RAM speed. While Apple was busy unveiling a  new 12-inch MacBook without any full-sized USB ports, PC makers took the opportunity to mock the future they'll inevitably adopt.\nLenovo was first out the gate by calling the new MacBook \"so last year,\" the ultimate insult to any fashion-conscious laptop buyers. Lenovo also went for a comparison picture showing how its Yoga 3 Pro is 12.8mm thin compared to the 13.1mm thinness of the MacBook, all while conveniently overlooking the fact its laptop is 0.62 pounds heavier than Apple\u2019s latest. The comparison picture also makes the MacBook look rather thick. Regardless, the Yoga 3 Pro does have two USB ports and a higher-resolution display, and Lenovo was quick to point that out.\nWE SEE YOUR thin laptop ( #SoLastYear ) & raise you 3 modes, 2 USB ports & a higher-resolution touch display. pic.twitter.com\/vm3K08YCpt\n\u2014 Lenovo (@lenovo) March 10, 2015\nDell followed Lenovo in its response to the Macbook with a tweet dismissing its Retina display. Dell claims its XPS 13 has 2 million more pixels than the MacBook, but weight and thickness didn\u2019t even feature in Dell\u2019s comparison. While Dell\u2019s XPS 13 is heavier and thicker than the MacBook, you do get two USB ports, a mini DisplayPort, and a SD card reader. No $79 dongles required.\nOur #DellXPS 13\u2019s virtually borderless infinity display has 5.7M pixels - that's 2M more than a 12\" retina display. pic.twitter.com\/mrT9uwo7C2\n\u2014 Dell (@Dell) March 10, 2015\nThe final entry in the PC market response is Asus with its ZenBook UX305. At just 12.3mm thin it certainly beats the MacBook thickness, and even has an impressive three USB ports, micro HDMI, and SD card reader. It\u2019s still slightly heavier than the MacBook, and Asus forgot to mention it only has a 1920 x 1080 13-inch display on the base model.\nZenBook UX305 is even slimmer than the new Macbook. It's also about half the price. #Incredible pic.twitter.com\/ATSENGVMIi\n\u2014 ASUS North America (@ASUSUSA) March 11, 2015\nIf there\u2019s anything these comparisons teach us it\u2019s that PC makers will compare only their very best stats and ignore the rest. That\u2019s surprisingly similar to Apple\u2019s own stats manipulation during its keynotes, but it\u2019s also a reminder that the PC market doesn\u2019t have an answer to the new 12-inch MacBook just yet \u2014 a good combination of weight, thickness, trackpad, and high-resolution display. Some have matched or got close to the MacBook Air, while failing on the quality of trackpads and battery life.\nThe PC competition might have managed to keep an array of ports on impressively small machines, but Apple is  signalling the future of laptop connectivity with its  aggressive use of the small, reversible USB Type-C . That\u2019s no excuse for just one port on the new MacBook, a 480p camera, 29W charger, and one of the lowest Core M processors in the range, but it\u2019s just the beginning. After all, the original MacBook Air only had one USB port, and look where it is today:  copied by some PC makers, envied by all.\nVerge Video: Everything you need to know about the new MacBook\n","Title":"PC makers mock Apple\u2019s new MacBook | The Verge","Tags":["apple","microsoft","tech"]}
