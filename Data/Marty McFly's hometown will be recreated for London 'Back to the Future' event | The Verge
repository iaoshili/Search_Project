Only this time, it will be in London. Secret Cinemas has announced plans to recreate the whole town as part of its immersive Back to the Future cinema experience. Hill Valley will be rebuilt at an undisclosed location in London, and visitors will be able to \"time travel\" between 1985 and 1955 through secret alleyways and corridors. And yes, the DeLorean will be there as well. \"We want the audiences to forget their current world and take an adventure,\" said Fabien Riggall, Secret Cinema's founder,  speaking to the London Evening Standard .\nOf course the main attraction here is still the movie, but Secret Cinema wants to enhance those screenings wherever possible. For instance, once the film's over, attendees can make their way to an after-party inspired by the Enchantment Under the Sea prom that brought Marty McFly's parents together. Musical acts will square off in a Battle of the Bands each day to determine who performs on the prom stage. As you might guess, the Secret Cinema event has Back to the Future fans buzzing, and the company has at times been overwhelmed by ticket demand;  50,000 people tried to secure their seat in a single morning. And that's with adult tickets priced at £55.65 (around $93). The first showing is scheduled for July 24th. Londoners will also be able to see  Back to the Future performed as a musical next year.\n","Title":"Marty McFly's hometown will be recreated for London 'Back to the Future' event | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
