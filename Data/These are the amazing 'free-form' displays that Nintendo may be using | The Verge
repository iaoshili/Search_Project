{"Main text":"These are the amazing 'free-form' displays that Nintendo may be using\nSharp's latest screen tech comes in all shapes and sizes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSharp first showed off its unique Free-Form Displays last year, and the technology took on a whole other level of intrigue when it was reported that Nintendo would be the first customer \u2014 possibly for a new portable games console, or the company's mysterious sleep-tracking device . The latest prototypes are on display at CES 2015, so we thought we'd take a look for ourselves.\nThe displays are an evolution of Sharp's IGZO technology, and can be cut into virtually any shape. (Nintendo reportedly, inexplicably wants a doughnut-shaped display with a hole in the middle.) The gate driver circuits are embedded into the active area of the display, allowing for ultra-thin bezels and unprecedented form factors.\nSharp's prototypes are mostly showing demo loops of driving information; it's clear that one obvious application is installing displays that take advantage of any available space on unusual surfaces like a car dashboard. But what could Nintendo do with such a technology? We'll likely have to wait until next year, when the displays go into mass production.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
