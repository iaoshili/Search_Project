{"Main text":"Comedy club uses facial recognition to charge by the laugh\nBig Brother is watching you giggle\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA comedy club in Barcelona is charging patrons per laugh. This is real,  according to the BBC .\nThe  Teatreneu club , in partnership with ad agency  The Cyranos McCann , has installed tablets on the back of each seat equipped with facial recognition software that can apparently detect when you laugh. The going rate is 0.30 Euros ($0.38) per laugh, up to a maximum of 24 Euros ($30.45). In other words, buy 80 laughs and the rest are free.\nThe system was reportedly intended to be used as an experiment \/ case study and then successfully raised the average ticket price. It is now, again according to BBC, being \"copied in other theaters around Spain.\" (I repeat out of incredulity, not mistrust: Europa Press covered the debut in April.)\nThis is the creepiest thing I've ever seen in a comedy club, and let me be clear, comedy clubs aren't pretty places.\nI imagine this will inevitably lead to the absolute weirdest argument over a check, going line by line and debating each laugh for intensity and validity:\nChuckle\nSmirk\nTeehee\n... And if you're the kind of comedian that favors building up to large laughs (as opposed to, say, a rapid-fire stream of one-liners), then this probably isn't the future for you.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
