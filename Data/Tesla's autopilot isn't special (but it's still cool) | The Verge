{"Main text":"Tesla's autopilot isn't special (but it's still cool)\nAn important non-revolution for self-driving cars\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\"We\u2019ve been able to accelerate autopilot and bring it to market faster than originally anticipated,\" Elon Musk said to a gathered throng at Hawthorne Airport last week , the ex-Northrop facility in Southern California that both Tesla and sister company SpaceX call home. \"It\u2019s actually in production. In fact, every car coming off the line at Tesla at the factory has the autopilot hardware.\"\nMusk has an outsized personality with a reputation for flair and hyperbole, and for the most part, he earns it: both Tesla and SpaceX have undertaken and delivered on profoundly large challenges that entire industries (and governments) have failed to overcome. And his preferred term of \"autopilot\" for the bundle of hardware and software installed on new Teslas isn\u2019t inaccurate \u2014 the car can take control on highways, park itself in your garage at home, and intervene when it thinks you might be on a collision course.\nBut for as many things as Tesla\u2019s autopilot mode does, the one thing it doesn\u2019t do is change the game. The stereotypical vision of a car of the future tooling around your neighborhood with a driver comfortably asleep at the wheel (or missing altogether) isn\u2019t any closer to reality than it was before.\nOnly incrementally more advanced than what's already on the road\nWhile it\u2019s true that Musk introduced the most advanced commercial autonomous driving system yet, it\u2019s only incrementally the most advanced when compared to what\u2019s already on the road. The sensor package that all Model S vehicle rolling off the assembly line now have installed bears much resemblance to what various automakers have been offering for years: radar, forward-facing cameras, and ultrasonic sensors are new to Tesla, but they aren\u2019t new to the industry at large. For instance, the Lexus HS250h that I used to drive, manufactured in 2010, could effectively drive itself on highways using its lane-keep assist and dynamic cruise control \u2014 between those two features, the car had full control over steering, acceleration, and braking. Like Tesla, it used a combination of radar and cameras.\nOf course, sensors, software, and the legal landscape have all matured since then. There\u2019s little question that Tesla\u2019s system is the most advanced and the most integrated to get a production commitment, but others like Mercedes-Benz\u2019s Steer Assist \u2014 which is available on the 2014 S Class \u2014 come awfully close. Some BMWs can already read speed limit signs, as the Model S can now do. And while there isn\u2019t another car on the market that will park itself and pick you up unattended, Audi has demonstrated it . Meanwhile, a startup is preparing to ship automated driving as an add-on for Audis that are already on the road.\nAutomakers from Volkswagen to Volvo are converging on approximately the same place: hands-off driving in easy, relatively predictable conditions \u2014 highways, mainly \u2014 in the next couple years, with full autonomy likely to come a few years after that. (NHTSA refers to these systems as Level 3 and Level 4, respectively. ) Tesla\u2019s in roughly the same place, it\u2019s just pushing a little harder by promising a 2015 launch and a campaign of rolling software updates to make the system more advanced over time. And, of course, Tesla has the X-factor, Elon Musk.\nThe technology can\u2019t really move any faster than that. Just ask Google, which has logged hundreds of thousands of miles testing self-driving systems over the past several years but hasn\u2019t solved snow and heavy rain in its new car (and it\u2019s equipped with a wider variety of sensors than Tesla is using). The challenges to making a car that can safely transport you from door to door \u2014 no matter where those doors are and what the prevailing conditions may be \u2014 still loom large.\nThere will be many stepping stones along the way\nBut there will be many stepping stones along the way, each system a little more autonomous than the one before it. By 2017, you\u2019ll see a full host of highly automated systems available on cars, and not just on expensive ones. Tesla\u2019s lower-cost Model 3 will undoubtedly offer it, as will many others. By automotive standards, 2017 is just one mid-cycle refresh away. It\u2019s the blink of an eye.\nFrom there, Tesla runs into the same challenges facing everyone working on self-driving technology. The first, and perhaps the biggest, is a protracted policy battle: self-driving cars are finding friends in politics one state at a time, and only four states currently have laws on the books for provisional licensing of autonomous cars. The rules don\u2019t rewrite themselves overnight, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered about how these cars will function in real-world situations and distribute liability. Even if fully driverless vehicles were ready today, it\u2019d take years before they were broadly legal to use in all conditions nationwide.\n\"Tesla\u2019s a Silicon Valley company,\" Musk noted in a recent CNNMoney interview about autonomous driving. \"If we\u2019re not the leader, shame on us.\" And yes, Tesla will be first to market with a particular set of autonomous features \u2014 but other automakers came before it, and more will follow. Each launch advances the self-driving conversation a quarter notch. Ultimately, it\u2019s not going to be about who\u2019s first \u2014 it\u2019ll be about getting millions of driverless vehicles on roads large and small, safely, with nary an incident in sight.\n","Title":"Tesla's autopilot isn't special (but it's still cool) | The Verge","Tags":["report","front-page","transportation\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"vox"]}
