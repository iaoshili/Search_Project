{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI love audio. And I want you to love audio, too. But I\u2019m not sure you can, because of this habit you\u2019ve got. I know you\u2019re busy, and you have a lot on your plate, and there are so many shows to keep up with, but you need to stop listening to podcasts sped up to 1.5x. You need to open yourself up to love.\nOpen yourself up to love\nRadio \u2014 like film, music, TV, theater, and dance \u2014 is a temporal art. It relies on the passage of time to play with anticipation, tension, and release. A good radio producer knows how long a thought will linger in a listener\u2019s consciousness, and either grants her that time, or purposely denies it. A conversation between two hosts is riddled with pregnant pauses and interruptions designed to head off miscommunications. We\u2019re used to these patterns, and a good podcast is paced to play into them. Why, then, should we mess with that balance in the name of efficiency?\nThere are a few ways podcast apps go about speeding programs up. The most common is simply to run the audio at faster-than-normal speeds, often 1.5x. Thankfully, this process doesn\u2019t tend to affect the pitch of the material. At best, it forces our brains to work in overdrive; worst, it destroys the art of timing.\nTake this clip from  This American Life\u2019s \"Retraction\" episode . Ira Glass confronts performance artist Mike Daisey about fabricating portions of his supposedly autobiographical show.\nThat\u2019s one massive pregnant pause, and it says so much more than anything either man could verbalize. Here\u2019s the same exchange, at 1.5x.\nConsider the world around you\nThe difference is subtle, yes. On the scale of the show, the proportions and timing stay the same, and you get the point: there was a long pause there. But here\u2019s the problem: the world around you, the world you\u2019re driving in, or walking around, continues to move at 1x. Your body and mind are still perceiving time the way they always have, and now that this podcast has been sped up, that agonizing gap just isn\u2019t quite uncomfortable enough to make you lean into the steering wheel and wonder who will break the silence first.\nIf you use the app Overcast , you\u2019re probably familiar with its SmartSpeed feature. In theory, this is a more forgiving way of speeding up podcasts. The app looks for silences, and shortens those gaps in order to make up time without affecting the rate of speech. It certainly sounds more natural than simply speeding up a show wholesale, but check out what it does to that Mike Daisey clip:\nThat uncomfortable silence is way shorter. And the scary thing is that if you had turned on SmartSpeed at the global app level, you\u2019d never know what you\u2019re missing. The app also lets you use SmartSpeed with an additional speed multiplier. Here\u2019s that clip at 1.5x with SmartSpeed.\nI don\u2019t fault the app\u2019s developer, Marco Arment, for creating this feature. In 2015, if you make a podcast app, it\u2019s basically expected that there\u2019s some sort of fast playback built into it, and SmartSpeed is, without a doubt, a more natural way of doing that. But an alarming number of my colleagues and friends (whom I thought should know better) listen to podcasts at warp speed. There\u2019s something curious and terrible happening here.\nWe're at the dawn of a new Golden Age of radio\nIt\u2019s been said that we\u2019re at the dawn of a new Golden Age of audio, and I tend to agree. Serial very well may have done to podcasts what The Sopranos did for serial television. It was narrative, deep, and presented by an expert storyteller. It used audio \u2014 which you\u2019ll recall is a temporal art \u2014 to its full potential, much like, say, Orson Welles did in 1938.\nVerge Video: Welcome to the Golden Age of podcasting (Top Shelf, Season 3)\nSo what would The War of the Worlds sound like to today\u2019s commuter in a hurry?\nYikes, what a mess. There\u2019s no tension, no pacing, no anticipation. Sure, you know academically what\u2019s happening there, but you don\u2019t feel it. And that was the whole purpose of The War of the Worlds; its urgency and real-life feel is essential to its success. And in this age of podcasting, shows are relying more and more on the artistry of storytelling for their success.\nAs a podcast producer, the popularity of speed ramping has started affecting how I think of production. Should hosts speak more slowly to counteract it? Should I lean on a music bed to trick SmartSpeed into keeping the pace unaltered? As these features become more popular, they could hold back experimentation in audio.\nConsider what the artist intended and why\nIn film and music, there\u2019s a lot of talk about \"what the artist intended.\" It tends to be overblown, but there\u2019s some consideration here.  This Reddit thread is shocked to find that TBS is speeding up Seinfeld by 7.5%. In the very same thread, people nonchalantly defend listening to podcasts sped up by 50%. How is this different?\n1.5x is the motion smoothing of audio. It distorts a producer\u2019s intention, and if it becomes too widespread, producers no longer have control over the quality of their shows. At normal speed, Serial's theme, for example, sets a plodding, curious tone.\nAt 1.5x, it turns into this jaunty hip-hop tune:\nAt the end of the day, though, I guess I just hold onto some romantic ideas about radio. It\u2019s an incredibly intimate medium; I feel like I personally know the hosts of my favorite shows. They talk to me at moments in my life when I\u2019m not particularly engaged. I\u2019m walking to the subway, doing the dishes, or loading the dryer, and my friends are weaving intricate, paced stories for me. Why would I want to rush that or use podcasts as a quick utilitarian dump of information? Don\u2019t I have enough of those during my day? Isn\u2019t that the whole appeal of audio?\nMaybe, at the end of the day, all you'll really get from audio is that raw information dump. Maybe you won't fall in the love with the art in podcasts. But by listening at 1.5x, you're starting with a handicap. You don't love your favorite movie because you watched it out of the corner of your eye, listening just for the important details. Give real time a chance.\n","Title":"Stop listening to podcasts at 1.5x | The Verge","Tags":["podcast","tech"]}
