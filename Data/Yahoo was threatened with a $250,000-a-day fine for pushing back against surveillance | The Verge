{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday, Yahoo announced plans to release new documents detailing its legal fight with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) . FISC is best known for authorizing the NSA's widespread data collection orders, issuing its decisions in secret because of the confidentiality of the programs involved. Yahoo says it was involved in a multi-year suit before the FISC court, challenging the court's authority for \"what we viewed as unconstitutional and overbroad surveillance,\" according to a post by Ron Bell, the company's general counsel . At one point during the proceedings, the government threatened to fine the company $250,000 for every day it refused to comply.\nThreat of penalties raises the question: Can you be fined in the US by a completely secret court? Jailed?\n\u2014 Julian Sanchez (@normative) September 11, 2014\nThe full documents haven't been uploaded yet, but Yahoo says they add up to roughly 1500 pages, some of which have been released previously in more redacted form. It's a new declassification effort, thanks in part to a recently closed case with the FISC's court of review, but a vast portion of the details still remain secret, even from Yahoo's legal team. Still, Bell says it may not be the last time Yahoo pleads its case before FISC, and \"we will continue to contest requests and laws that we consider unlawful, unclear, or overbroad.\"\n","Title":"Yahoo was threatened with a $250,000-a-day fine for pushing back against surveillance | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
