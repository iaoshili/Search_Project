At least, this seems to be the reasoning behind  Audi\u2019s decision to let an A7 Sportback drive itself across more than 550 miles of highway from San Francisco to Las Vegas for this year\u2019s show. The stunt is designed to show off the German manufacturer\u2019s new \"Piloted Driving\" tech \u2014 a sort of intermediary step between cruise control and fully autonomous driving that can handle highways without human intervention but isn\u2019t ready for navigating city streets. And, yes, there\u2019ll be a human behind the wheel for the whole two-day trip.\nIf drivers don't take control near cities, the car will park itself in the emergency lane\nThe technology in the prototype A7 builds upon  Audi's previous systems , using a combination of five radars, a laser scanner (aka LIDAR), and a handful of 3D cameras dotted around the vehicle. The car can drive at speeds of up to 70mph on highways, and Audi says it will even initiate lane changes and \"passing maneuvers\" completely independently.\nWhen the A7 approaches a city however, an alarm will sound and the dashboard will start flashing, prompting the driver to take manual control. Audi says that if this doesn\u2019t happen \"the system activates the hazard lights and brings the car to a full stop\" \u2014 usually in the emergency lane. Although company isn\u2019t saying when this \"production ready\" tech will become commercially available, semi-autonomous systems like this could provide a perfect introduction to fully fledged self-driving cars. That is, as long as we don't all find ourselves waking up from a quick nap on the road, lights blinking, in the emergency lane.\nThe dashboard in Audi's experimental A7 Sportback.\n","Title":"Audi's A7 Sportback is driving itself more than 550 miles to CES this year | The Verge","Tags":["transportation","ces-2015"]}
