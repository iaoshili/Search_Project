{"Main text":"Audi says it's working on an all-electric SUV for 2018\nWith a 310 mile range.\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAudi's dabbling in all-electric vehicles recently culminated with the R8 e-tron, a flashy looking sports car that was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show this past week . But the company has bigger plans in the form of a sports utility vehicle. Speaking at Audi's annual press conference in Germany yesterday, engineering chief Ulrich Hackenberg said the company plans on bringing a battery-powered \"sports activity vehicle\" in early 2018. That car, which Hackenberg described as \"very attractive,\" would also have a range upwards of 500 kilometers (or about 310 miles), he added.\nHere's what was quickly flashed behind Hackenberg as Audi's current concept for the vehicle:\n(Auto Express)\nThe vehicle will compete squarely with Tesla's upcoming Model X, which is expected by the end of this year ( after several delays ). Its expected 200 to 225 mile range would be well below Audi's, though it could be on the market a two whole years before the German automaker gets its first car in the hands of customers.\nNo word yet from Audi on price or where the company intends to sell it, of course. Audi's Q5 hybrid (pictured above) starts at $51,900.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
