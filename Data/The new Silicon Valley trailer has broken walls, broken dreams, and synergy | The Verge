{"Main text":"The new Silicon Valley trailer has broken walls, broken dreams, and synergy\n'It's sexist, but it's about friendship.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMike Judge's slapstick tech world comedy Silicon Valley returns for a second season next month, and last night HBO unleashed a new trailer to make the wait a little easier. Or harder, depending on how you look at it.\nThe clip features the Pied Piper gang getting ready to brain-battle it out with their Nucleus competitors. How do they do that? \"Getting Pied Piper out there.\" \"Brand awareness.\" \"Synergy, bitches.\"  That, in a nutshell, is what you can expect from this season. Also maybe Gilfoyle setting stacks of cash on fire and Jared speaking with the soft cadence of a nervous angel.\nThe season premieres on April 12th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
