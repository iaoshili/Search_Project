The craft was beset by wind and a malfunctioning valve. Another attempt will be made tomorrow morning.\norion is meant to carry people farther than any mission since Apollo\nThe first launch time was 7:05AM ET, but a boat in the launch  exclusion area delayed it. Then, Orion was ready to blast off at 7:17AM \u2014 but the  ground winds were too strong. A  third attempt was scheduled for 7:55AM, but it too was delayed by wind. Another launch time was scheduled for 8:26, but Orion was held yet again after a fill-and-drain valve on the rocket malfunctioned. A final launch was scheduled for the end of NASA's window, at 9:44, but it was also scrubbed.\nOrion is meant to carry people farther than any mission since the end of Apollo; the Space Shuttle ,  which ferried astronauts to the Hubble Space Telescope or the  International Space Station for 30 years until its retirement in 2011,  wasn't designed to fly nearly as high. If Orion lives up to its  expectations, it could be used to send people to asteroids, the moon,  and \u2014 with a little luck \u2014 Mars. For more design details, this article  in Air & Space is excellent reading.\n","Title":"NASA's planned Orion launch is postponed until tomorrow | The Verge","Tags":["breaking","science","transportation"]}
