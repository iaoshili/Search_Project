{"Main text":"Motorola Moto E (2015) review\nIt turns out $149 can buy a lot of smartphone\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCrunch. That\u2019s the sound of glass doing a belly-flop on concrete. A couple of months ago, I heard it for the first time. After a long night of Dungeons & Dragons and bar-hopping, I got to my front door, reached for the keys in my pocket, and instead fumbled a Nexus 5 to the sidewalk. I thought I\u2019d be bummed out \u2014 but then, a day later, I was fine. The phone still worked, and even though the glass had been shattered, it was totally usable. I even felt morbidly relieved; now that my Nexus had a one-way ticket to the island of misfit toys, I had one less precious object to fret over. Since then I\u2019ve been ready for a cheap, but competent smartphone \u2014 one I don\u2019t have to worry about \u2014 and I found it in Motorola\u2019s new $149 Moto E.\nThe new Moto E is $20 more than its shockingly cheap predecessor, and this time around it\u2019s got LTE, a bigger battery, and a slightly larger screen. It\u2019s a small bump up in price, but that\u2019s probably okay; it handled streaming shows on Netflix, running Crossy Road and Monopoly, giving me real-time navigation, and everything else I wanted it to do without the sluggish performance I\u2019d expect from a phone this inexpensive. Text on the screen looks a little fuzzy compared to the best displays out there, but I quickly stopped noticing it after a day.\nThe Moto E's camera is its weakest point\nThe E is pleasing to look at and hold. I would even call it beautiful. Its curves and lines are utilitarian but friendly, its 4.5-inch screen rests comfortably in my hand, its weight is balanced, and its design is clean of cruft. There\u2019s even a little genius in small details, like the smooth circular depression on the back of the phone with Motorola\u2019s logo in it. When I use the phone with one hand, the bottom landing on my pinky, my index finger naturally rests in the nook. It\u2019s a pleasing sensation, and it makes my grip feel secure when I\u2019m thumbing a tweet or a text message. You can also customize the phone\u2019s look a little bit with swappable colored bands that wrap around its edge. I chose pink.\nThankfully, the software is just as clean as the Moto E\u2019s appearance. It runs a lightly customized version of Android 5.0 Lollipop, and I mean lightly. It mostly feels like stock Android except for a few unobtrusive Motorola apps and quirks. One of the quirks I unexpectedly found myself loving is Quick Capture: a feature that lets you twist your wrist to open the camera app. Sadly I can\u2019t recommend that you ever use the Moto E\u2019s camera.\nThe Moto E\u2019s camera is its only truly upsetting feature. Sure, there are bad cameras all up and down the Android price range, but the Moto E\u2019s camera is actual garbage that belongs in an actual garbage bin. These days that\u2019s a huge problem, even for someone like me who doesn\u2019t use a ton of apps. The apps I do use often, like Instagram and Snapchat, are all about photos and video. I just don\u2019t want to share anything that comes from the Moto E\u2019s camera. If you care about the photos you take from your phone, it\u2019s a deal-breaker.\nSample image taken with the Moto E\nStill, I could see myself using the Moto E every day as my only smartphone.\nI\u2019ve been working at The Verge since 2011, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with smartphone enthusiasts . I\u2019ve been ribbed by my colleagues on more than one occasion \u2014 even laughed at \u2014 for having an unfashionably \"old\" phone in my pocket. But I guess that just makes me like a lot of people out there \u2014 unwilling (or more likely, unable) to drop hundreds of dollars on a whim every six months to buy the newest, shiniest smartphone. I think smartphones are marvelous machines, but you\u2019ll probably never see me camp in line for the privilege of spending $800 on a new one.\nI could see using the Moto E every day as my only phone\nFortunately, that thrifty instinct doesn\u2019t keep me from enjoying everything I love about smartphones anymore. (Well, everything except a decent camera.) The difference between last year\u2019s top phone and this year\u2019s top phone is a crack in the sidewalk compared to the chasm between, say, the Motorola Q and the first iPhone. In his review of last year\u2019s Moto E, Vlad Savov called it \"the people\u2019s smartphone \u2014 the smartphone that makes all others look stupidly expensive.\" The same is true for Motorola\u2019s latest attempt, and it\u2019s a refreshing counterpoint to the maelstrom of hype that just came out of Mobile World Congress .\nI didn\u2019t grieve for my shattered Nexus 5, but I did agonize for the phone that came before it: an HTC One I bought from T-Mobile at full price in 2013. Last year, a week after its one-year warranty expired, I woke up and found that my One died overnight. It was really upsetting! I couldn\u2019t afford to replace it, and I\u2019m still paying T-Mobile $20 a month for a broken phone. It turns out there\u2019s a huge emotional gulf between dropping a $180 phone on the ground and losing nearly $600. So the best part about a competent, affordable smartphone like the Moto E? It doesn\u2019t control me. I won\u2019t worry as much about losing it, or having it stolen, or dropping it on concrete. That peace of mind is something the newest iPhone or Galaxy can\u2019t offer.\n","Title":"Motorola Moto E (2015) review | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","review","tech"]}
