It\u2019s a slightly unsettling idea, but it\u2019s also one that physicists have been thinking about for some time. Unfortunately, until recently, a 2D universe wasn\u2019t something we could verify. Now, thanks to an experiment recently launched at Fermi National Laboratory in Illinois, we might finally be able to determine how the universe stores the information we interact with everyday \u2014 and whether we\u2019re living in a hologram.\n\"For thousands of years we have assumed that space is made of points and lines,\" said Craig Hogan, director of Fermilab\u2019s Center for Particle Astrophysics, in an email to The Verge. But \"maybe that is not right \u2014 it might be made of waves, the way that matter and energy are.\"\n\"Ultimately, it will be a fundamental limit on what we can ever measure, think or do.\"\nTo determine if the universe is actually two dimensional, physicists have set up an experiment called the holometer. It consists of two high-intensity laser beams \u2014 beams that are roughly equivalent to 200,000 laser pointers \u2014 that are split using a beam splitter, and sent perpendicularly down two 40 meter arms. Then, at the end of the arms, the beams are reflected back to the splitter, where they\u2019re recombined. The idea here is that when the beams hit the splitter a second time, the beam splitter might move in a certain way, and cause the beams\u2019 brightness to fluctuate. If that happens, it would mean that space is continually vibrating, sort of like a wave \u2014 a 2D wave, to be exact \u2014 and the spitter is being carried along space\u2019s constant jitter.\nSuch a result could fundamentally alter our perception of the world, because it would mean that information about our universe is stored on tiny two dimensional particles, ones that are about 10 trillion times smaller than an atom. \"If you think about reality as a giant computer, that's all there is. The total information [it can contain] is finite,\" Hogan said. \"Ultimately, it will be a fundamental limit on what we can ever measure, think or do.\"\nIf we do live in a 2D world, there\u2019s no telling how that might affect human life. \"Einstein's theory of space-time is now coded into everyone's smart phone, but that took almost 100 years,\" Hogan said. So for now, the researchers prefer to focus on the task at hand: analysing fluctuations in returning light. Altering how humans understand the universe will come later, if at all. \"We should know within a year or so if the effect is really there.\"\n","Title":"A physics experiment might soon tell us if we're living in a 2D hologram | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
