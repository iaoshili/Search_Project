{"Main text":"Next\nA new theme and tweaks to the Start Menu\nChanges elsewhere include some slight tweaks to the Windows 10 user interface. There's a new black system theme across the Start menu, Taskbar, and Action Center. Microsoft has also added transparency to the Start menu and Taskbar, and the ability to resize the Start Menu again. There's even an AutoColor option that pulls colors from your background wallpaper to theme Windows 10. The power placement in the Start Menu has been altered, based on feedback Microsoft says. It's now in the bottom left of the Start Menu, similar to where it is in Windows 7 and previous versions of Windows.\nMicrosoft is also making some changes to the Continuum tablet mode for Windows 10. A previously  leaked build revealed these changes in detail , and Microsoft says it\u2019s making the touch mode \"more touchable\" with the Start button, Cortana, and Task View buttons all growing in size once touch mode is enabled. Pinned and running apps are also removed to \"reduce clutter and simplify the experience.\" There\u2019s also some minor improvements to the Task View icons, buttons, and thumbnail previews, and the ability to create as many virtual desktops as you want.\nWindows 10 might be ready in time for a  late July launch , or at some point in the summer, but that doesn't mean it's bug-free. As usual, there are a number of known issues with this particular preview. One bug prevents desktop apps from launching from the Start Menu. A workaround involves searching for your particular app and then pinning it to the task bar or simply launching it that way. As always, this is a preview release so it's best to avoid installing this on a main machine.\n","Title":"Windows 10 preview now includes new Outlook mail app and theme tweaks | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
