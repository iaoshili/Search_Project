{"Main text":"This is what a one-dimensional video game looks like\nYou ask for longer games, you get a longer game\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt the Game Developers Conference, countless lectures and panels rap on the depth of video games. Line Wobbler isn't interested in depth per se \u2014 or width, for that matter. The one-dimensional dungeon crawling adventure is played on a single, lengthy row of LED lights. Controlled by the spring of a shoe tree, a green dot moves up the path, completing a stage when it reaches the end of the rope. Enemies, represented by red dots, can be dispatched by wobbling the shoe tree, which releases a length of some sort of artillery \u2014 it's tough to say when you're working with a handful of dots. The game has obstacles, a boss battle, and a colorful victory lap for those who complete it.\nLike Butt Sniffin' Pugs , Line Wobbler is part of ALT.CTRL.GDC, the Game Developers Conference showcase focusing on alternative controls for video games. Creator Robin Baumgarten doesn't currently have plans for a traditional release, as the lights can run upwards $200, but says he's looking into other ways to make the game available to potential players. I like to imagine the Empire State Building's new lighting system being put to good use with a couple rounds of one-dimensional action.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
