{"Main text":"FCC pushes back deadline for people to weigh in on net neutrality rules\nFive extra days to reply to 1.1 million public comments.\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe US Federal Communications Commission is giving people nearly a week more to weigh in Chairman Tom Wheeler's proposal for a new net neutrality framework. Today  the FCC said people have until September 15th (a month from now) to reply to comments made by others as part of an earlier phase that wrapped up July 18th. The previous deadline (September 10th) would have given people a month, however the FCC's site was slammed in the beginning of the process and unable to handle the influx of traffic, causing the original public  comment deadline to get pushed back .\nA set of rules  proposed by the FCC back in May will either ban or permit paid prioritization of internet traffic. As part of the process, the FCC opened it up to public debate, resulting in 1.1 million comments, some of which included  death threats and profanity . Critics are concerned that the so-called \"fast lanes\" could hurt consumers and innovation, while some of the companies pushing for those fast lanes say certain online activities could benefit from prioritization. Which of those two options the FCC goes with depends on a final vote expected later this year.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
