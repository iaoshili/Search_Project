{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nStar Wars Celebration this year was a mecca for fans of things from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It was also an opportunity for Lucasfilm to take the wraps off some of its upcoming new movies, including the first details about Gareth Edwards' stand-alone film Rogue One and a new teaser trailer for the highly anticipated The Force Awakens.\nUp on the second floor of the convention center, there was an exhibit dedicated solely to models, costumes, and props \u2014Â  including a controversial lightsaber \u2014 from J.J. Abrams' upcoming film. Here's a look at what you can expect to see on the big screen when the Star Wars saga continues this December.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nNote the square radar dish.
