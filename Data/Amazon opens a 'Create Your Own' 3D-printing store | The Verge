{"Main text":"Amazon opens a 'Create Your Own' 3D-printing store\nCustomizable jewelry, toys, and decorations are just a few clicks away\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNot to be  outdone by eBay , Amazon today opens the doors to a new  3D Printing Store that allows the customization of \"more than 200 unique print on-demand products.\" Personalized dog tags, credit card holders, iPhone cases, and even custom bobbleheads are among the first selection of items that Amazon has on offer. The massive online retailer won't be involved in the manufacturing process and is simply connecting its shoppers with established 3D-printing businesses like Sculpteo, Mixee Labs, and 3DLT, who will be responsible for fulfilling orders placed through the new store.\n\"The online customer shopping experience will be redefined through 3D printing,\" says Sculpteo CEO Clément Moreau, as \"a customer's wants are no longer limited to what is in stock but instead by what they can imagine.\" Moreau thinks Amazon's participation will expand the market for 3D-printed goods dramatically and reduce promotional costs for producers. Amazon's Marketplace director Petra Schindler-Carter agrees and says that the goal is to have \"a potentially infinite number of products\" available for personalization.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
