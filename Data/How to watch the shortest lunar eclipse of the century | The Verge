{"Main text":"How to watch the shortest lunar eclipse of the century\nYou've only got a few hours left\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn just a few hours, the moon will move into a shadow cast by the Sun shining on Earth, creating the shortest lunar eclipse of the century. The partial eclipse will begin at 6:15AM ET and the total eclipse will last just a few minutes, according to  Sky and Telescope . Here's how to make sure you don't miss it.\nFor morning people\nMost of eastern North America and western South America will be able to look up and see the beginning partial stages of the eclipse before sunrise, while India, parts of China, and Russia will be able to view the ending stages after sunset. Beginning at 6AM ET, the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles  will stream the event live .\nIf you've heard the term \"blood moon\" being tossed around to describe the event, that's because as the Sun's light passes through Earth's atmosphere,  blue light is filtered out , causing the moon to look like it's glowing red.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
