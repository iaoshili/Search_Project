{"Main text":"Riding in the Mercedes-Benz F 015\nI spent a day in the year 2030\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\u201CPlease, go ahead.\u201D\nThe gleaming silver spheroid resting before me on the tarmac has a pleasant, female voice. It\u2019s friendly, almost conversational, were it not for the monotonous whirring of a strange motor in the background.\n\u201CPlease, go ahead,\u201D it says again. It\u2019s telling me that it\u2019s safe to cross in front of it, I believe, so I can get in on the other side. There is no sense of urgency or impatience. This machine isn\u2019t subject to emotion, to the frightening cocktail of testosterone and adrenaline that beget the tragically human phenomenon of road rage.\nMercedes-Benz couldn\u2019t have picked a more appropriate venue to demonstrate the F 015 Luxury in Motion , a distant-future vision of what a fully autonomous car could eventually look like. We\u2019re standing with a group of other journalists at one end of a dilapidated runway at the Alameda Naval Air Station, a vast expanse of concrete and weeds that has remained essentially unchanged since the military base\u2019s closure in 1997. Enormous transoceanic freighters glide by in the channel a few hundred feet to the north, backdropped by the hazy silhouette of San Francisco\u2019s skyline several miles away. MythBusters is known to film here, because you can have an explosion or a crash go horribly wrong and it doesn\u2019t really matter. It\u2019s basically a scene from Mad Max.\nIf there\u2019s a place in America where I might expect a car to wean itself off humans and start talking to them, this is it.\nBefore the F 015 has a chance to ask me once again, I dart in front of it. I don\u2019t know what an autonomous car sounds like when it gets frustrated with a pedestrian, but I don\u2019t care to find out.\nMercedes debuted the F 015 not at Detroit\u2019s North American International Auto Show in January, but at CES the week prior. That is to say, Mercedes announced its most exciting project in years not on the auto industry\u2019s biggest stage, but on technology\u2019s.\n\"It's a research car, not a concept car.\"\nThat speaks volumes about what this vehicle really is. As I chat with Vera Schmidt, a user interface designer who works out of Mercedes\u2019 Silicon Valley R&D center, she calls the F 015 a concept car, then catches and corrects herself. \"It\u2019s a research car, not a concept car,\" she says. Concept cars often foreshadow an automaker\u2019s design direction, which is always a primary topic of conversation at international auto shows; the F 015, on the other hand, is basically a rolling laboratory.\nToday, most autonomous driving projects imagine a near future that\u2019s tethered to the technological and political realities of the present: here\u2019s a car that looks like any other car on the road, and oh, by the way, it can drive itself sometimes.  With the F 015, Mercedes says that it freed itself of those constraints and just kind of went crazy. Let\u2019s assume, just for the hell of it, that we\u2019ve completely solved the bureaucratic nightmare that awaits us when cars drive themselves. Let\u2019s assume that driverless cars are culturally accepted. Let\u2019s assume that the technology is perfected and we\u2019ve made it small enough to fit into a tiny compartment inside a regular road-going car. (Of these assumptions, that last one\u2019s the safest.)\nGoogle is approaching self-driving research in a similar manner, but the end goal is different: whereas Google wants to make a little box that efficiently gets you from Point A to Point B , Mercedes is still trying to make something that evokes an emotional response, just as well-designed cars do today. Basically, here\u2019s a car company\u2019s interpretation of a car in a post-driver world.\nWhen you don\u2019t have to drive, you don\u2019t have to look away from the people you\u2019re riding with\nThe F 015 doesn\u2019t really communicate \"beautiful\" through its design \u2014 at least not by any present-day standard. But it definitely communicates \"future.\" Holger Hutzenlaub, who runs Mercedes\u2019 Advanced Design department, jokes that the F 015\u2019s internal codename was \"Led Zeppelin,\" noting subtle cues, like the placement of the GPS antenna hump on the roof, that help visually differentiate front from rear. (It\u2019s not a stretch to suggest that the car looks a bit like a flightless dirigible.) He gestures to a board of sketches showing the car\u2019s evolution over several years of internal iteration; the final concept is substantially different from the very earliest designs, but one thing remains constant: the carriage-like cabin, allowing four people to face each other. Rear suicide doors and the absence of B-pillars \u2014 the strips of metal that normally divide the front and rear passenger compartments of a car \u2014 leave a cavernous hole in each side of the F 015 for easy entrance and exit from the swiveling seats. Maybe in 20 or 30 years, this will be the defining element of an autonomous car; when you don\u2019t have to drive, you don\u2019t have to look away from the people you\u2019re riding with.\n(Mercedes-Benz)\nEverything about the F 015 is automated, or at least gives the appearance of being automated \u2014 the car is summoned by a smartphone app, opens and closes its doors automatically, and gently urges nearby pedestrians (like me) to \"please, go ahead.\" In reality, the car was continually being attended to by a substantial fleet of Mercedes engineers brought in from Germany and Silicon Valley, babying it as if it was made of papier mâché. Currently, the F 015 isn\u2019t even fully autonomous \u2014 it needs arrays of beacons on the surrounding pavement to define its path.\nAnd after each group of four went on the short, closed-course trip, there was a full inspection and a reset of the car\u2019s internals. Several emphasized to me that the car is \"sensitive,\" reacting poorly to rain and extreme heat. They made it sound, ironically, almost human.\nThe car is \"sensitive,\" reacting poorly to rain and extreme heat\nOn my first trip in the F 015, I climbed in with two fellow journalists and Thomas Jäger, a concept engineer at Mercedes. Even approaching this car is a theatrical event: the LED array in the grill glows blue to indicate that it recognizes your presence, a feature designed to give pedestrians some degree of assurance that this two-ton automaton isn\u2019t about to run you over. A high-intensity laser mounted beneath the car\u2019s badge can project symbols onto the road, including a green crosswalk, of sorts \u2014 another sign that it\u2019s safe to walk in front of the car. Mercedes is really playing up the F 015\u2019s ability to be a good citizen in dense spaces filled with people, pets, other cars, and general urban chaos, hyper-aware of its surroundings. If it says \"please, go ahead\" and you want to respond with \"no, I insist, you go ahead,\" you can even make a waving motion at the car and it\u2019ll drive on by.\nA demonstration of the F 015's high-intensity laser, which can project messages onto the road ahead.\nThe interior of the car is starkly different from its exterior. From the outside, with its opaque, metallic windows, Hutzenlaub says the F 015 almost seems \"mysterious\" \u2014 is there anyone even driving this thing? \u2014 but the cabin is a mixture of wood, leather, polished aluminum, and giant touchscreens basically everywhere they could possibly fit. There\u2019s a big display embedded in each of the four doors, one across the entire dashboard, another behind the rear passengers, and one more on a floor-mounted console that can automatically extend into a table. The décor is still cold, but it\u2019s an inviting kind of cold, not a \"metallic zeppelin of unknown provenance\" kind of cold.\nThe décor is cold, but it\u2019s an inviting kind of cold\nIn a traditional car, this amount of digital stimulation would be criminally distracting: gently undulating patterns move in sync across the displays, which can be manipulated to control music, take phone calls, and even see live views from the exterior cameras of nearby F 015 drivers you\u2019ve befriended. (There\u2019s no way this privacy nightmare would ever make it to a production vehicle, I\u2019d wager \u2014 even in the distant future.) But when a car is in complete control of itself, the passengers need as many distractions as they can get. The display in the retractable table could have games on it, for instance, although it didn\u2019t have any loaded yet.\nWithout warning or fanfare, the F 015 starts moving. The windows that look like sheets of metal from the outside are actually see-through once you\u2019re inside, but the views seem intentionally deemphasized; there\u2019s a sense that they\u2019re smaller than they could have been, because the focus is on the LCD displays and the people you share the cabin with. The coating that gives the windows their metallic sheen interferes a bit, too \u2014 they\u2019re tinted by a pattern running across them. It\u2019s a bit like looking through a vinyl wrap. If there was something pretty outside, this wouldn\u2019t be the car you\u2019d want to be in. I asked Schmidt why Mercedes didn\u2019t use windows that could be dimmed electrostatically \u2014 clear when you want to see outside, opaque when you want to take a nap and let the car do its thing. She said they\u2019d considered it, but they\u2019d wanted to also embed displays in the windows, and the technology simply wasn\u2019t there yet.\nIs this really the future of transportation?\nBut even without next-gen digital windows, the F 015 still has interactive displays everywhere, unavoidable in any line of sight. Is this really the future of transportation? Will we stop having any sense of where we are right now, turning our attention instead to work, games, reading, or the passengers around us? The notion of blocking out the outside world during a commute feels uniquely Californian to me \u2014 again, Mercedes has a lab in Silicon Valley \u2014 because the gridlock is legendary here. If you can look at a sunset or a beach or a portrait of your family instead of the bumper of the guy ahead of you, maybe you\u2019re living a less stressful life.\nNothing about the interior was perfect, but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be: it\u2019s a hodgepodge of ideas that are fleshed out just enough to test, to gauge reaction. The touchscreens were fidgety, the fit and finish weren\u2019t great, and the car sounded really weird \u2014 a continuous drone from a fan that never changed pitch. The seats, which rotate to help you get in and out of the car, would occasionally rotate for no obvious reason. Of course, I can probably name two dozen ways this car isn\u2019t street legal, too. As functional non-production cars go, the F 015 is minimally functional. (To its credit, Jäger tells me they\u2019ve taken it up to 200 km\/h \u2014 124 mph \u2014 but we never get anywhere near that out here at Alameda.)\nAs functional non-production cars go, the F 015 is minimally functional\nAt some point on our lackadaisical, figure-eight trip up and down the airstrip, the car came to an abrupt halt, as if it detected something was wrong. Jäger, Secret Service-style earpiece in his ear, waited for word from the army of engineers nearby. The pause, the hush that filled the cabin, was long enough for a bit of reflection.\n\"The last two years, this car has been my life,\" he said. His English is perfectly understandable, but he suddenly apologizes profusely for it, insisting that he\u2019s out of practice. There\u2019s a moment where he seems to get a little emotional, frustrated by a language barrier that prevents him from fully articulating the motivations behind the project that has completely consumed him. And right then, there was this surreal feeling where four people were in this car, this teardrop-shaped transportation pod, sharing a moment. We were facing each other, surrounded by displays and a post-apocalyptic backdrop, trusting technology completely to take us to our destination. There was no concern for the car or the road. We were focused on Jäger, and he was focused on us.\nAfter a while, he spun his chair around, deployed the telescoping steering wheel, and took manual control of the car. \"You\u2019re the only group to see this,\" I heard him say. He was driving a little more aggressively than the car drove itself, apologizing for the unexpected detour as we arrived back at the starting point. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it was better to see both modes in operation: the F 015\u2019s steering wheel isn\u2019t just for show. One of Mercedes\u2019 Italy-based interior designers, Till Varailhon, tells me that the company\u2019s self-driving cars will always have steering wheels; driving manually is part of the emotional connection with a car, and you certainly can\u2019t drive manually without a steering wheel.\nI left Alameda no more convinced that I ever want a fully autonomous car in my life than when I arrived. But regardless, the F 015 definitely imparts a broader perspective for what fully autonomous driving could mean someday: it\u2019s not just about reducing accidents and taking away control of two-ton death machines, as Elon Musk would say . You\u2019ve got this reclaimed time that you can use, and this research car is trying to figure out how you might use it.\nIn recent days, Mercedes has been driving the F 015 around locations in San Francisco, letting the public get close to it, taking selfies, asking questions. As the company flashes through a slideshow of the gathered throngs, there\u2019s clearly curiosity, if not outright interest.\nLegalizing a car that disengages drivers this far from their cars will take Herculean effort spread over many years \u2014 but winning hearts and minds probably isn\u2019t a bad place to start. It\u2019s a 2030 concept, after all, and even that might be a little aggressive. In 15 years, we\u2019ll know whether we\u2019ve untangled a rat\u2019s nest of automotive bureaucracy, whether people are okay with being shuttled around by artificial intelligence alone, and whether real cars of the future are this pleasant with hesitating pedestrians.\n\"Please, go ahead,\" I heard it say as another group got ready to approach the car. Not a hint of exasperation yet.\n","Title":"Riding in the Mercedes-Benz F 015 | The Verge","Tags":["report","transportation"]}
