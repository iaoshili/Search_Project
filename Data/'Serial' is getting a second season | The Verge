From the  official Serial blog :\nThis American Life funded the bulk of Season One, but for Serial to continue, it needs to pay for itself. Today, we have good news: between the money you donated and sponsorship, we\u2019ll be able to make a second season.\nYou can  still donate , of course, which will presumably help fund a third season or alternatively  hire some big-name actors for the lead roles.\nThere will be a Season Two of Serial. To everyone who donated to make this possible: THANK YOU. http:\/\/t.co\/KsnpvITMOx\n\u2014 Serial (@serial) November 26, 2014\nThe first season of Serial, which  broke the iTunes record for fastest podcast to reach 5 million downloads and streams, chronicles Koenig as she investigates the 1999 death of Hae Min Lee. Her ex-boyfriend, Adnan Syed, is currently serving a life sentence for her murder.\nNo word on what's coming up for season two \u2014 \"we'll be working on it as soon as this season ends,\" according to the staff \u2014 but here's a suggestion: solve the mystery of \"Mail Kimp.\"\nwhoa, found out why the person at the beginning of Serial mispronounces \"Mail Chimp\" pic.twitter.com\/TxW9DNEtBp\n","Title":"'Serial' is getting a second season | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","entertainment"]}
