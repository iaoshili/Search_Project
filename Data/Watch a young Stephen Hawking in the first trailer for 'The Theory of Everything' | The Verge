{"Main text":"Watch a young Stephen Hawking in the first trailer for 'The Theory of Everything'\n'Where there is life, there is hope'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Theory of Everything is one of this year's most anticipated movies. It tells the remarkable and difficult story of Stephen Hawking, chronicling him at Cambridge and then as he lives with a life-changing diagnosis; but it's mostly about his incredible relationship with his wife Jane. The film (which looks like total Oscar bait) is based on a book Jane wrote, and stars Eddie Redmayne (Les Miserables) and Felicity Jones (The Amazing Spider-Man 2). It will premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September, and hit theaters November 7th.\nThe first trailer quickly jumps through the timeline of the movie (it's not like there are spoilers about what happened to Stephen Hawking, really) and looks in on a couple of intimate moments between Stephen and Jane. It makes the movie look pretty saccharine and not especially nuanced \u2014 but taking a movie at its trailer is rarely a good idea anyway.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
