{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOn Saturday, Dr. Kent Brantly arrived in Atlanta, Georgia. He is understood to be the first person carrying ebola who has been inside the United States. Dr. Brantly, of Texas, contracted the highly contagious virus while working in Liberia to help treat ebola patients, and he  has been brought back to the US for intensive care at Emory University Hospital. The university is equipped with a special facility \u2014 designed in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control \u2014 made to treat patients with extremely contagious conditions. Dr. Brantly's co-worker, Nancy Writebol, also contracted ebola at the same clinic in Liberia. She is expected to return to the US for intensive care in a few days,  according to The New York Times .\nEvery known precaution taken\nBringing Dr. Brantly back home was  far more complicated than buying a plane ticket. The Christian aid organization he was working for, Samaritan's Purse, worked with the CDC and the US State Department to secure his entry into the country, reports the Times. It hired a specially-configured aircraft with a tent-like device on board to contain the deadly pathogen. Once the plane arrived in the US, the patient was placed in an ambulance. All on board, including Dr. Brantly, were protected with white hazardous material suits. He was then brought to Emory University Hospital.\nDespite the precautions, some observers panicked at the idea of an ebola patient arriving in the US. The internet and Twitter, in particular, are awash in paranoid fears of a mass contagion. CDC director Thomas R Frieden tried to assuage concerns, telling the Times that \"These are American citizens. American citizens have a right of return. I certainly hope people\u2019s fear doesn\u2019t trump their compassion.\" While there is no known cure for ebola, supportive therapy that keeps patients healthy and hydrated can help the body live long enough to fight the virus. The current outbreak in Western Africa has a mortality rate of 55 percent.\nThe U.S. must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our \"borders.\" Act fast!\n\u2014 Donald J.

Flying to Atlanta today.\n\u2014 Jimmy Wales (@jimmy_wales) August 3, 2014\nCorrection: Dr. Brantly is from Texas, not North Carolina as originally stated.\n","Title":"US aid worker infected with ebola is now being treated at an Atlanta hospital | The Verge","Tags":["us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
