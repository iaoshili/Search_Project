{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBobby McKenna is a designer at Vine , the popular six-second video-sharing service owned by Twitter. McKenna helped design every pixel in the app, from its vibrant color palette to its rich paper-like icons. McKenna has a style that is uniquely his own, and which has inspired a new wave of mobile apps and sites that embrace flatness without eschewing character or depth. He took a few minutes to talk to The Verge about building Vine\u2019s dead-simple capture screen, why establishing constraints make for great design, and Nickelodeon\u2019s cartoon Doug. You can find him on Twitter at @bobby , and on Dribbble here .\nWhere are you right now?\nI am sitting in a leather recliner in my hovel of an apartment, trying to ignore the leaky faucet in the bathroom, and half paying attention to SportsCenter. Three hairless cats are curled up at my feet. I\u2019m wearing a quincea√±era dress.\nHow did you end up at Vine?\nRus Yusupov (Vine co-founder and creative director) and I have worked together off and on for two or three years now. I did a bunch of illustrations and stuff for his old shop, Commercial Pop , back when I lived in Philly. When he started Big Human (a product design studio that lives one floor below Vine), he asked me to design the identity. A few months later I moved to New York, and Rus asked if I\u2019d be interested in spending some time as a freelance art director at Big Human\u2026 or if I\u2019d rather work on this thing called Vine.\nHaving never worked on anything digital, I was excited for the opportunity and a little worried that I\u2019d blow it. But I knew that if I wanted to live with myself, I had to say yes. So I said yes. And then a bunch of other stuff happened, and now I\u2019m doing an interview with The Verge.\nWhat tools do you come back to, again and again, both analog and digital?\nAll the standard digital stuff \u2014 Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I actually use Adobe Bridge , which a lot of designers think is bad, but they\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s good.\n\"I don\u2019t get too wrapped up in expensive pens or notebooks with weird European nonsense grids.\"\nOn the analog side of things, I don\u2019t get too wrapped up in expensive pens or notebooks with weird European nonsense grids. Just whatever writing instrument and scrap of paper is nearby. Actually, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve bought a pen or pencil since like eighth grade. Not sure where this cup full of pens and pencils on my desk came from. Starting to feel kind of nervous about it.\nWhat\u2019s your process like for designing? Do you tend to over-design and then pull back, or do you keep things light from the get-go?\nI tend to spend about 50 percent of my allotted time sweating and worrying about the thing I have to make, 30 percent nervously puking it out onto the screen, and 20 percent trying to arrange the puke into something that looks not terrible. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\nWhether you\u2019re designing a logo, app, icon, or book cover, are there any basic processes or rules you adhere to?\nI\u2019d love to be one of those guys with a really methodical Process With A Capital P, but my brain just refuses to operate that way. Those guys seem so confident and relaxed. Not me. I\u2019m a wreck when I\u2019m working, especially if it\u2019s on something I care about.\n\"If you give me a blank canvas and tell me to make whatever I want, I will lose my mind.\"\nThe only consistent element of my \"process\" is my need for constraints. If you give me a blank canvas and tell me to make whatever I want, I will lose my mind. So even when I get a brief that\u2019s like, \"Hey, we trust you. Just make something cool,\" I have to tie one hand behind my back before I can really get started.\nYou\u2019re big into GIFs and pictograms. What can you do with a GIF that you can\u2019t do with other mediums?\nIt\u2019s certainly easier to be funny or absurd when you can make a picture move and loop. Looping can take a mediocre joke and make it hilarious just through sheer force of repetition. It always reminds me of that old Simpsons bit with Sideshow Bob and the rakes .\nMan\u2026 what if there were an app that did like, GIF, but with sound. Somebody should make that.\nOn my (desperately in need of an update) personal website , I use obnoxious GIFs to weed out people I don\u2019t want to work with. Kind of like psychedelic concert posters from the \u201870s \u2014 if you can\u2019t read this crazy lettering, you probably shouldn\u2019t come to the show.\nWhat design element, big or small, in the Vine app are you most proud of?\nStripping the capture screen down to its most essential elements was a very satisfying process, and I think the resulting design has enhanced the experience of recording a video on Vine. It\u2019s just you and the thing you\u2019re making. No extraneous bullshit.\nI\u2019m also very proud of the intentional misspelling of the \"wierd\" channel.\nWhat was your favorite cartoon growing up, and why?\nI really liked Doug . It\u2019s a show about a normal kid in a town full of weirdos, which is kind of how I\u2019ve felt ever since I moved to New York.\nHow would you describe your visual aesthetic as a designer? When Vine launched it felt very on-the-ball visually, and now many apps and sites are using similar designs.\nI\u2019d like to think that I always provide the appropriate solution to a problem. But the truth is, for better or worse, every designer has little tics and tendencies \u2014 moves you can fall back on when nothing else is working.\nMy inclination is always to use as few parts as possible to build a machine that works. And if I can make that machine sort of silly and not too self-important, that\u2019s a huge bonus. I like design that winks at its audience. I think my work does a pretty good job of that, Vine included.\n","Title":"Bobby McKenna on crafting Vine's 'wierd' and wonderful design | The Verge","Tags":["apps","5-minutes-on-the-verge","interview","design\",\"Story Streams\"","\"2719053"]}
