{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMarvel\u2019s Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. will soon open its doors at New York City's Discovery Times Square. The exhibit, a collaboration between Victory Hill Exhibitions, Marvel, NASA and the National Academy of Sciences, is perhaps the most ambitious and expensive production that's ever been put on at Discovery. It offers visitors an immersive tour of Marvel's universe and incorporates dozens of props from The Avengers , Captain America, and more. But the experience as a whole is what will stand out most to Marvel fans \u2014 even if you've never touched a comic and have only seen the movies.\nUpon entering the exhibit, you're greeted by SHIELD agent Felix Blake, who invites you to temporarily join the squad's elite ranks. Visitors are each given a personal ID card that's used to activate various interactive games and scientific lessons placed throughout the show. Since real-life education is meant to be a theme of S.T.A.T.I.O.N., you'll learn how Thor\u2019s hammer conducts electricity, what happens to Bruce Banner\u2019s brain chemistry as he morphs into the Hulk, and so on. Luckily none of this feels forced or detracts from the overall presentation. The incredible atmosphere makes it feel as if you're actually touring the halls of SHIELD, and this is aided by the exhibit's refusal to break the fourth wall. For example, Loki's scepter made its way here only after being recovered from Stark Tower at the end of The Avengers. The full Chitauri on display was also \"captured\" as part of that battle and encased in a sealed chamber. Small touches like these and meticulous attention to detail make the exhibit feel all the more alive and somehow real.\nIf you're a Marvel fan, this one's not to be missed. Unfortunately, we can't say exactly when you'll be able to visit. After the press was offered a tour on Thursday evening, the exhibit was scheduled to open on Friday \u2014 but that's now been pushed back due to some last minute technical problems. You can visit Discovery Time Square's website for the latest on when the public will be welcomed in.
