{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSolstice be damned: in the movie business, summer is nigh upon us. Theaters will become awash with equal parts over-the-top blockbuster action as well as family-friendly escapades \u2014 explosions and hugs, in other words, mapped to innumerable sequels and reboots. It's a place where all the trailers, teaser trailers, extended trailers, preview scenes, television spots, and pint-sized blips finally get to grow into real, honest-to-goodness audience pleasers.\nSo what exactly is there to watch in this post-Furious 7 world \u2014 a movie that upped the ante both in explosions and hugs? We've got a couple dozen suggestions that will be hitting theaters between now and the end of August.\nMay\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron\nIt's the 11th film in Marvel's highly interconnected Cinematic Universe, and once again, Earth's Mightiest Heroes (aka the box office's most lucrative ensemble ) team up to take on an evil, sentient AI with an arsenal of weaponry and witticisms. The marketing blitz has been rather epic in scale, so chances are you already knew about this one. Which is to say this blurb really isn't necessary, so... hello there, how are you doing? Good weather today? \u2014 May 1st\nRead more: Age of Ultron Review: Has the Marvel universe outgrown Joss Whedon?\nPitch Perfect 2\nTo see Pitch Perfect is to love it . Don't write it off because it's a movie about college a capella groups. More importantly, it's dozens of hilarious actors and actresses, many of whom actually can sing. The sequel seems to follow suit by raising the stakes (world championship singing?) and additionally puts David Cross in the role of an a capella aficionado. That should tell you everything you need to know. \u2014 May 15th\nMaD Max: Fury Road\nThirty years. That's how long it's been since the last Mad Max film was released. Time has apparently been good to the franchise, however, as Fury Road looks to be one long and utterly insane car chase complete with over-the-top violence and eccentric character. It might even best Furious 7 in crazy automotive stunts , which is no small feat. \u2014 May 15th\nTomorrowland\nThe Iron Giant. The Incredibles. Mission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol. As a director, Brad Bird has had an impressive run of films over the last 16 years, and Tomorrowland looks like it has all the makings of another hit. Written by Bird and \"mystery box\" expert Damon Lindelof, Tomorrowland has something to do with a parallel futuristic world that also somehow ties into the Tomorrowland exhibit at Disney theme parks and... hey, look! There's George Clooney! We're sure it'll all make sense when we see the film. Probably. \u2014 May 22nd\nPoltergeist\nFrom what we've seen so far, the modernized Poltergeist remake seems to follow eerily closely to the 1982 classic horror film produced by Steven Spielberg, wherein a family moves into a house built on top of a cemetery, and ghosts \u2014 nay, poltergeists \u2014 start causing chaos. Even if that's ultimately the case, the new Poltergeist is being produced by horror vet Sam Raimi (Evil Dead, The Grudge), so worst-case scenario, it's going to have some really freaky jump-scare scenes. \u2014 May 22nd\nSan Andreas\nFirst: this movie has nothing to do with Grand Theft Auto. Still with us? San Andreas is a disaster movie that explores what would happen if an earthquake utterly destroyed Los Angeles \u2014 or more specifically, what would Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson do when faced with an unstoppable force of nature (spoiler: it's acts of heroism). \u2014 May 29th\nJune\nSpy\nIt seems like Paul Feig loves nothing more than to give Melissa McCarthy a gun and roll camera. Following in the footsteps of Bridesmaids and The Heat, Spy is about a CIA desk worker (McCarthy) who has to go into the field to stop nuclear calamity. The reaction to its SXSW screening was overwhelmingly positive, and the rest of the cast (including Jude Law, Jason Statham, and Allison Janney) add surprising gravitas to a film that looks to blend slapstick comedy with real summer movie action moments. \u2014 June 5th\nEntourage\nFor eight seasons HBO\u2019s Entourage served as a mash-up of Hollywood satire and wish fulfillment, following the adventures of Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier), his crew of hangers-on, and his agent Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven, in the role that\u2019s pretty much overshadowed everything he\u2019s tried to do since). While it wasn\u2019t clear that anybody was asking for more, the entire gang is getting the big-screen treatment this June \u2014 and if the trailers are any indication, fans of the series should be more than satisfied. \u2014 June 5th\nInsidious: Chapter 3\nWhen director James Wan jumped aboard the Furious 7 franchise, he left the burgeoning Insidious series behind. The new installment is being helmed by Leigh Whannell in his feature directing debut, and if the name sounds a little familiar that\u2019s because Whannell wrote the first two installments. He also co-created the Saw series with Wan, so he knows his way around a scary movie \u2014 and many, many sequels. \u2014 June 5th\nJurassic World\nThe prospect of another Jurassic Park seemed almost too good to be true, and the selection of Colin Trevorrow as director \u2014 a filmmaker known best for the small, quirky Safety Not Guaranteed \u2014 was nothing short of inspired. But the trailers have failed to set the world on fire, and after a recent clip showed off some rather  antiquated gender politics on behalf of Chris Pratt\u2019s character, we\u2019re not feeling as bullish as we once were. But still: DINOSAURS! \u2014 June 12th\nInside Out\nPixar\u2019s been touting Inside Out for years now as one of its most inventive new films, and judging by the concept, it\u2019s with good reason. The film takes place inside the mind of a young girl as she struggles with a move to a new city, and each of her emotions \u2014 Fear, Anger, Sadness, Disgust, and Joy \u2014 are portrayed as separate characters unto themselves, all operating in the \"headquarters\" of her mind. Director Pete Docter brought audiences to tears in record time with his last movie, Up \u2014 and from what we\u2019ve seen so far he\u2019ll have the opportunity to do even more this time around. \u2014 June 19th\nTed 2\nSeth MacFarlane crashed and burned last year with A Million Ways to Die in the West, but this year he\u2019s returning to the magical land of talking teddy bears and Mark Wahlberg that\u2019s treated him so well in the past. Nearly 30 seconds of the trailer is dedicated to a sperm donor gag, which should tell you pretty much everything you need to know. \u2014 June 26th\nJuly\nTerminator: Genisys\nAfter four feature films and a cancelled TV series, the Terminator franchise is back for another round of films, starting with Terminator: Genisys. Here, Kyle Reese goes back in time to save Sarah Connor, just like in the first film. But the timeline has changed. Now, Sarah\u2019s already teamed up with the T-800 and is fighting the war for the future early: a future where John Connor is an evil cyborg. This movie will either be great or an incredible mess. Hopefully it\u2019s the former. \u2014 July 1st\nMagic Mike XXL\nThe Magic Mike series knows what it is: pure female-gaze fan service. It wants to have fun with that idea, and it doesn\u2019t need explosions to pull that off. It \u2014 and, specifically, Channing Tatum \u2014 made \"Pony\" the song of a generation. For Magic XXL, it\u2019s more of the same, and that\u2019s just fine. We\u2019ll see you at the club. \u2014 July 1st\nMinions\nIf there was ever a breakout star in Despicable Me and its sequel, it was definitely the Minions. In their first titular film, we get to see the minions' origins and how they found their way to Gru. Having existed from the beginning of time (seriously), they live only to serve the most diabolical of villains. That imperative leads them to New York in the '60s, where they eventually meet Scarlet and Herb Overkill, two villains played by Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm. Is Universal milking as much money as they can out of this franchise? Sure. But it still looks cute. \u2014 July 10th\nSelf\/less\nSelf\/less looks intriguing, but between the bizarre marketing campaign and Ryan Reynolds\u2019 track record at the box office, chances are this movie will be terrible. Here, Ben Kingsley plays a rich and successful aristocrat who discovers he has cancer. After paying to have his consciousness transferred into Reynolds\u2019 body, he soon finds that his new body still retains its old consciousness. For some reason, guns are involved. We\u2019ll just have to see on this one. \u2014 July 10th\nTrainwreck\nTrainwreck made its debut at SXSW this year, and it\u2019s already garnered some serious critical acclaim. In a screenplay written by Amy Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, Schumer plays a writer with the kind of sex life normally reserved for men in bro comedies. Bill Hader comes along to not so much sweep her off her feet as watch helplessly and patiently while she makes a mess of things. We have high hopes for this. \u2014 July 17th\nAnt-Man\nTo say that the production of Marvel\u2019s Ant-Man has been troubled would be putting it lightly. After losing Edgar Wright over creative differences, Marvel enlisted director Peyton Reed to get the film over the finish line, and we\u2019re still unsure how the final product will turn out. In the film, Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a former criminal put into the Ant-Man suit by genius inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). He\u2019ll face off against House of Cards alum Corey Stoll as the villainous Yellowjacket. Silly names, we know, but at least the trailer is entertaining. \u2014 July 17th\nPixels\nThis being an Adam Sandler \/ Kevin James vehicle, the odds on Pixels being good are pretty low. Based on  a popular online video , the story involves aliens declaring war on Earth and taking the guises of classic video game characters like Pac-Man. Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad also show up for the fighting, and it should at least be a nice nostalgia trip for old-school gamers. \u2014 July 24th\nMission: Impossible \u2014 Rogue Nation\nTom Cruise strapped himself to the outside of a plane before it took off for this movie. That kind of commitment deserves your attention. Much like the Fast & Furious franchise, the Mission: Impossible series tries to outdo itself with each movie. Plus, it always helps the movies have managed to stay good up until now. This one could be worth it. \u2014 July 31st\nVacation\nWith so many other franchises getting rebooted, perhaps it was inevitable that the National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation series get a revamp. Here, the Griswolds (and especially Chevy Chase) are all much older. Rusty, played by Ed Helms, wants to do some family bonding, so he sets about dragging everyone to Walley World, the family\u2019s favorite theme park that\u2019s by now ready to be shut down. The movie sounds like the summer\u2019s requisite grownup comedy. Unfortunately, that gives us no hints as to the movie\u2019s quality. \u2014 July 31st\nAugust\nFantastic Four\nYes, Fox has been able to keep X-Men alive, but when it comes to that other Marvel franchise it controls, the studio has never really hit stride. After films in 2005 and 2007, Fox is now rebooting Fantastic Four, and there\u2019s some quality cast signed up: Miles Teller (Whiplash), Kate Mara (House of Cards), Michael B. Jordan (Fruitvale Station), and Jamie Bell (Jumper). Josh Trank is directing this as his follow-up to Chronicle, and even if you don\u2019t care about Reed Richards or The Thing, you should watch for Trank\u2019s work alone \u2014 he\u2019s signed up for a Star Wars standalone movie , after all. \u2014 August 7th\nStraight Outta Compton\nIce Cube and Dr. Dre have become such entrenched mainstream media stars \u2014 Dre works at Apple, people \u2014 that it\u2019s easy to forget they were once controversial. Named for N.W.A.\u2019s debut album, Straight Outta Compton tells the story of how Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella came together in the 1980s against a backdrop of violence and police brutality, changing hip-hop forever. Director F. Gary Grey has had his share of successes (The Italian Job, Friday) and failures (A Man Apart), but with the group\u2019s two biggest stars producing, the movie is sure to have one of the best soundtracks of the year. \u2014 August 14th\nThe Man from UNCLE\nOnce upon a time, Guy Ritchie used his trademarked mix of action, violence, and comedy to stand out with films like Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. These days he uses it for gonzo takes on Sherlock Holmes, or \u2014 in the case of The Man From UNCLE \u2014 1960s television shows. The movie stars Man of Steel's Henry Cavill and The Social Network's Armie Hammer, both playing it with tongue planted firmly in cheek, as a mismatched pair of agents tasked with stopping a mysterious criminal group. \u2014 August 14th\nHitman: Agent 47\nIt\u2019s been nearly 10 years since the Hitman video game series got its first movie adaptation, and now it\u2019s time for another go around the block. This time Homeland star Rupert Friend plays the titular Agent 47, a cloned assassin identified by the barcode on the back of his neck, while Zachary Quinto plays a guy going by the name John Smith. This one isn\u2019t going to be violent at all.  \u2014 August 28th\nLearn more\n","Title":"The Verge summer movie guide: the biggest and buzziest films of the season | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
