{"Main text":"The Game is getting another reality show on VH1, this time to find love\nThe Documentary, VH1 style\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn what has to be one of the shrewdest business moves since BET's Nellyville, VH1 has  ordered She's Got Game, an hour-long show that will follow rapper The Game as he goes on a search to find love. The soon-to-be hit series is the latest evolution of The Game's relationship with VH1, which aired Marrying The Game for three seasons until The Game broke up with his fiancé Tiffney Cambridge last year.\nShe's Got Game follows in the footsteps of VH1's unbreakable formula of very-far-past-their-prime rap and rock stars looking for love with smash hits like Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and For The Love of Ray J. The Game's journey to eternal happiness will be documented during his national tour this summer, and he'll be getting help from some celebrity friends. Will The Game find true happiness? Can he find someone to hate 50 Cent as much as he does? Will any of the women be able to name a song he's made in the last eight years? All these pressing questions and more will be answered this summer, on VH1.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
