{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nXbox Entertainment Studios may have some life left, after all. According to  The Hollywood Reporter , the studio has had preliminary talks with Warner Bros about possible acquisition. The deal is said to be unlikely, but it does suggest XES isn't dead completely \u2014 even if it can't stay at Microsoft. If a Warner Bros. deal did happen, THR's sources say the studio would merge with  Machinima , which Warner owns a minority stake in.\nMicrosoft had  ambitious plans for Xbox as an entertainment brand, focused largely around the Xbox One console. But then it  became the underdog to Sony's 10 million-strong PlayStation 4, and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer left the company (eventually trading in  Clippy for Clippers ). Under new CEO Satya Nadella and even newer Xbox leader Phil Spencer, Microsoft has been trimming most non-gaming aspects of the Xbox brand ( unbundling Kinect , for example, reportedly  doubled hardware sales ). The studio's closure was  announced in mid-July as part of the  18,000 or so job eliminations planned for the next year.\nWhat's left of Xbox Entertainment Studios, in terms of  projects or personnel, isn't entirely clear. When the studio's closure was first announced, Spencer noted that Ridley Scott's  live-action Halo: Nightfall and Steven Spielberg's  mysterious other Halo series would continue as planned under Microsoft's 343 Industries.\n","Title":"Xbox's TV studio not dead yet, reportedly looking for new home | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","gaming","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
