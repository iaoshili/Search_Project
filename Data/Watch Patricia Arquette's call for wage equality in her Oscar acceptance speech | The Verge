{"Main text":"Watch Patricia Arquette's call for wage equality in her Oscar acceptance speech\nMaking the seconds count\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPatricia Arquette justÂ  won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in Richard Linklater's Boyhood. During her acceptance speech, Arquette hurriedly thanked seemingly dozens of people, including Linklater and the Boyhood cast and crew, then made a call for gender equality in Hollywood.\n\"It\u2019s our time to have wage equality once and for all, and equal rights for women in the United States of America,\" she said, before music ushered her out.\nIt was a brief, scattered, and rushed call to action, but it was met by a fist pump of agreement from Meryl Streep and wild applause from the audience.
