{"Main text":"Watch a zombie get hit by a car in this new Walking Dead trailer\nRick Grimes is back \u2014 and hairier than ever\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\"We do what we need to do, and then we get to live.\" That's the somber advice Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) gives to his scrappy band of zombie apocalypse survivors in the new trailer for the midseason return of The Walking Dead.\nBut what about Morgan Jones?\nWhen we left the gang in November, the killing was hitting a crescendo. Lieutenant Dawn Lerner (Christine Woods) killed Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) and a furious Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) in turn killed Dawn. Daryl and his crossbow are relatively quiet in the season five trailer, but that's probably just because he's too busy killing reanimated dead matter.\nMichonne (Danai Gurira) closes the trailer by asking, \"Don't you want one more day with a chance?\" to which we say yes, Michonne, yes we do.\nThe Walking Dead returns to AMC on February 8th at 9PM ET.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
