A post, authored by Microsoft corporate vice president Rajesh Jha, appeared on the  company's official blog today. Titled \"blank post please delete,\" the post's body copy gave no information as to its purpose, but its slug \u2014 the text in its web address \u2014 read \"microsoft-acquires-acompli.\"\nThe post's web address read 'Microsoft acquires Acompli'\nThe post has gone now, after being screenshotted for posterity by TechCrunch, but the fact that an early draft of an announcement was apparently erroneously published could indicate that a deal between the two companies is complete or in its final stages. If true, Microsoft would be acquiring  a powerhouse email app that The Verge's Casey Newton called \"the Outlook for iPhone that Microsoft hasn't yet built.\" Acompli also brought its app and a new \"focused inbox feature\"  to Android last year , shortly after it raised $7.3 million in investment. TechCrunch speculates that the company may have been pitching for another round of funding recently, before receiving an offer from Microsoft.\nAcompli did not immediately respond to requests to comment from The Verge. Microsoft, too, has yet to comment on the post or any potential deal between the two companies.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
