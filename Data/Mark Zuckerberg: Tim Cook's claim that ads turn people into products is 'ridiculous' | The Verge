{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMark Zuckerberg has rejected Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s claim that \"when an online service is free, you\u2019re not the customer. You\u2019re the product.\" In a  feature for Time on Facebook \u2019s  Internet.org project , the social network\u2019s founder was reportedly irritated by the notion that ad-supported services are bad for users, describing it as a \"ridiculous concept\".\n\"You think because you're paying Apple that you're somehow in alignment with them?\"\n\"A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising businessmodel with somehow being out of alignment with your customers,\" said Zuckerberg. \"What, you think because you\u2019re paying Apple that you\u2019re somehow in alignment with them? If you were in alignment with them, then they\u2019d make their products a lot cheaper!\"\nZuckerberg was referring to comments  made by Cook in September when the Apple chief defended the company's approach to security after hundreds of nude and private images of celebrities were  stolen from iCloud . Cook said at the time that he didn\u2019t want the company to become a \"treasure trove\" of user data for the National Security Agency (NSA) and warned consumers to stay clear of companies offering \"free\" services.\n\"I think everyone has to ask, how do companies make their money?\" said Cook. \"Follow the money. And if they're making money mainly by collecting gobs of personal data, I think you have a right to be worried.\"\nAlthough no companies were directly named, it was assumed that Cook was  referring to both Google and Facebook. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt offered a  similar rebuttal to Cook in October , saying his company had the best encryption standards in the industry and that the Apple chief hadn't been briefed \"correctly\" on his rivals.\nNevertheless, this ideological stance has been growing in influence in recent years and even inspired the creation of  alternative social network Ello , which asks users to agree that they\u2019re \"not a product\" during the sign-up process and has  become a public-benefit corporation to legally prohibit it from selling ads. Zuckerberg however is skeptical of this approach, telling Time that Ello won\u2019t ever grow with such a business model. \"Our mission is to connect every person in the world,\" he said. \"You don\u2019t do that by having a service people pay for.\"\n","Title":"Mark Zuckerberg: Tim Cook's claim that ads turn people into products is 'ridiculous' | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
