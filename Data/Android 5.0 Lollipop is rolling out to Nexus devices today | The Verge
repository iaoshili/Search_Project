If you don\u2019t want to wait for the OTA then you can simply  download factory images from Google\u2019s Nexus site. Google\u2019s roll out comes just hours after Motorola revealed it\u2019s in the progress of rolling out Android 5.0 Lollipop for two devices: the Moto X Pure Edition and second-gen Moto G.\nAndroid 5.0 Lollipop adds a significant amount of features and changes, but the biggest is a new look and feel that Google calls Material Design. The new design adds fresh animations and a flatter look to Android, alongside easily the most important update to the world's most-used mobile OS in several years.
