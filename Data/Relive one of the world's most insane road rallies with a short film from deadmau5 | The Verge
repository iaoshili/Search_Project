{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Gumball 3000 is wonderfully ridiculous. It doesn't know how to be anything else.\nThe international road rally \u2014 which pulls celebs, glitterati, and car enthusiasts across thousands of miles of highway every year \u2014 features some of the most incredible exotic cars you'll ever see. David Hasselhoff, of all people, is a regular participant. When  we dropped by Gumball's New York City checkpoint last year , highlights included a velvet-covered Rolls-Royce Wraith, a reasonably authentic Spider-Man hanging out of a car, and an outrageous Nyan Cat-themed Ferrari 458 Italia ( the \"Purrari\" ) owned by electronic music producer Joel Zimmerman \u2014 better known by his stage name, deadmau5.\nBasically, it's a spectacle.\nThe Purrari and a velvet-covered Rolls-Royce Wraith\nZimmerman, who drove the 2014 Gumball from Miami to Ibiza (with a transatlantic flight in between), tried to capture a little bit of the rally's essence  in a short film released today . It includes some of the sleepless banter between Zimmerman and co-driver Tory Belleci of MythBusters fame, run-ins with the police (eventually leading to the former's suspension from driving in Europe), and wild test drives at Daytona and Top Gear's famous Surrey test track.\nIf you're a car fan, it's a fun watch. Likewise if you're a deadmau5 fan: the producer \u2014 whose five-year retrospective 5 Years of mau5 came out in November \u2014 works in quite a bit of music from his most recent studio album, while(1\n2). (I've listened to it a bunch,  it's great , it's Grammy-nominated.) Live vicariously, because this is one road trip most of us will never take.\n","Title":"Relive one of the world's most insane road rallies with a short film from deadmau5 | The Verge","Tags":["exclusive","transportation"]}
