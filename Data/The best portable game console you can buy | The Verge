{"Main text":"The best portable game console you can buy\nEverybody plays video games now \u2013Â play them right\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVideo games are welcome at the table of popular art, alongside movies, music, and television. Home consoles get a lot of attention, but portable gaming has done the heavy lifting when it comes to expanding the reach and acceptance of the medium.\nThe road to ubiquity began with the peculiar rise of the Game Boy. An outdated piece of hardware upon its release in 1989, Nintendo would nonetheless sell over 115 million Game Boys and Game Boy Colors. Nintendo advertised the portable as a hobby device not just for the kids, but for the family. Countless adults lots entire nights to Zelda and Tetris.\nSince the late 2000s, smartphones have spread across the world at a rate that flounders Nintendo\u2019s hardware. Millions of people who never owned a home or mobile game console now do, and the thousands of good, bad, and somewhere in between smartphone games have become a preferred distraction for grown-ups passing a long commute or a quick smoke break.\nHere\u2019s the problem: Today, most of us play games, but not all of us play the best games on the best consoles that best match our interests. We get comfy with the latest free thing and make do. Why compromise?\nThere are four mobile gaming options available, all exceptional. I will be talking about these machines purely as game playing devices, so whether or not the hardware can also make a call or order Seamless is entirely irrelevant.\nI don\u2019t want to settle for okay. I want the closest to perfect mobile video game system.\nShot on location at WeWork . Also available on YouTube.\nThe Winner\nPlayStation Vita\nThe PlayStation Vita is the least commercially successful option available in the portable gaming market.  Generally ignored even by video game devotees, it\u2019s sold somewhere over 4 million units since its release in Japan in late 2011. Worse, Sony seems to be at a loss with the console, giving it little if any attention at trade shows. The Vita\u2019s future is a mystery.\nSo why is it hobbling onto the top of the podium? Because the PlayStation Vita feels like a peek at the future of portable gaming.\nIt\u2019s beautifully designed and comically ambitious, supported by a brilliant, deep, and varied catalogue of video games that spans decades. (If you\u2019re deep into the gaming hobby, the hardware is the portable equivalent of Sega\u2019s doomed Dreamcast, a console that drew the road map for today\u2019s online-friendly gaming systems.)\nTo be clear, the best PlayStation Vita is not the new PlayStation Vita, aka the Vita Slim, a plastic oddity that I\u2019ll get to shortly. No, I\u2019m referring to the original hardware, which has a bit more heft, making it easier to hold, and a far more attractive 960 x 544 OLED display.\nSony\u2019s spec sheet promises 3-5 hours of battery life while playing games. Three years after its purchase, my Vita still hits the high end of that estimate. Left in sleep mode, the system holds a charge for days.\nThe Vita is the first portable gaming device to include controls that achieve parity with what\u2019s available on modern consoles. It feels, more so than any mobile gaming platform has, like a home video game console that can be carried with you. Partly because it handles like you\u2019d expect, partly because of its stunning graphics that occasionally approach the quality seen on the PlayStation 3, and partly because it's catalog is full of console games.\nVia the PlayStation Network, dozens of classic PlayStation 1 games and a handful of PlayStation 2 games can be downloaded. Also available are some of the less-graphically intensive games from the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, like Nidhogg, The Unfinished Swan, and Don\u2019t Starve. The Vita also gets a \"free\" game each month if you\u2019re PlayStation Plus subscribers. Plus membership \u2014 which costs $50 a year and works across PS3, PS4, and Vita \u2014 provides multiple news games each month, along with nice discounts across the PlayStation digital storefronts.\nVita\u2019s \"exclusive\" game catalog is limited, mostly because Sony\u2019s interest in supporting the system with development resources has waned. However, the publisher does continue to partner with indie game developers, bringing some of the strangest and best games from PC to the portable console. I recommend downloading games onto one of Sony\u2019s proprietary \u2014 and overpriced \u2014 memory cards so you can just grab the device and go.\nThere\u2019s one last unusual, but noteworthy extension of the Vita\u2019s gaming catalog: if you have a PlayStation 4 and a fast Wi-Fi connection, the Vita will stream the console\u2019s games through its Remote Play feature. For those of us who share a television with friends or family, being able to easily stream a console game onto a handheld while someone else enjoys the TV may itself be a reason to make the purchase.\nNo other platform offers the best controls, an excellent screen, and the depth and variety of games, ranging from PlayStation 1 downloads to PlayStation 4 streaming. The PlayStation Vita may one day live alongside the Dreamcast as a brilliant, but underappreciated stroke of cursed engineering. It\u2019s ahead of its time, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t play it right now.\nThe Runner Up\nNintendo 3DS\nThe Nintendo 3DS intends to overtake the PlayStation Vita, eventually. While the portable got off to an astonishingly rough start by the standards of Nintendo, who dominated the mobile gaming market for the two decades prior, the system has recovered thanks to a healthy, gradually expanding catalog featuring beloved Nintendo franchises.\nLike Sony, Nintendo offers classic video games from consoles gone by, though it\u2019s inexplicable why some are available, while others aren\u2019t, and a lack of connectivity between purchases on the company\u2019s Wii U home console and 3DS makes buying downloadable retro games doubly frustrating.\nThe Nintendo 3DS also comes in the larger XL format. The difference between normal and XL cater to an individual\u2019s preference: would you prefer a slightly larger screen or a system that fits in your pocket? I prefer the larger screen, but it's up to you.\nThe Others\n","Title":"The best portable game console you can buy | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","mobile","review","tech","this-is-my-next"]}
