That brings the price down to $359 for a 16GB model (or $409 for the 32GB version) without a contract. It's one of the best deals on one of the  best Android phones you can buy today.\nIf you're a Verizon customer, Motorola is also offering the new Moto X for $0.01 with a new contract, a savings of $99.98 off its regular price. To sweeten the deal even further, Motorola is taking 30 percent off the prices of any accessories you buy with the new Moto X on Monday.\nTo get the promotional pricing, you will need to visit  Motorola's site at 12PM ET on Monday and register for a discount code, which will then be emailed to you. The code is valid for 14 days after you receive it. If history is any indicator, Motorola will likely run out of those codes rather quickly, so if you want to get in on the deal, prepare to jump on Motorola's site at noon sharp on Monday.\n","Title":"Get $140 off of an unlocked Moto X in Motorola's Cyber Monday sale | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"6957294"]}
