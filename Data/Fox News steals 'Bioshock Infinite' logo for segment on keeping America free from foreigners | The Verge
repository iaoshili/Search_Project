{"Main text":"Fox News steals 'Bioshock Infinite' logo for segment on keeping America free from foreigners\nBold-faced irony\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe logo for first-person shooter Bioshock Infinite appears to have been \"repurposed\" by Fox News. Irrational Games' co-founder and the game's creative director Ken Levine shared an image of the incriminating graphic  on his Facebook timeline yesterday along with the caption, \"Glad to help, Fox. Glad to help.\"\nThe resemblance is uncanny. The structural outline of Fox News' rendition is almost identical to the emblem utilized in Bioshock Infinite's award-winning video game.  Mediatite writes that the logo was exclusively used for a segment of the right-leaning talk show Fox & Friends that discussed illegal immigration. The hosts of Fox & Friends are known for criticizing President Obama and for championing increased border security in the US to clamp down on illegal immigration. In an ironic twist, Bioshock Infinite is  set in a fictional universe where immigrants are vilified and racial segregation remains part of the status quo.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
