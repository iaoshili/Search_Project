{"Main text":"Madden's simulation of the Super Bowl predicted the exact final score\nIf you don't want a video game simulation to spoil the score, don't read on\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEA Sports has been running Super Bowl simulations using Madden for more than a decade now with a respectable record of nine correct predictions and three false ones. However, this year it didn't just pick the winning team, it also foresaw that the Patriots would be trailing in the third quarter only for Tom Brady to deliver a game-clinching pass to Julian Edelman for a final score of 28-24.  Yahoo Tech notes that the simulator also got some of the finer details right, including the first team to score, Brady's number of touchdowns \u2014 and was also only 27 yards off nailing the quarterback's total passing yardage.\nHowever, what fun would an extremely detailed and realistic sports simulator be if you couldn't also organize a little chaos? If EA Sports' simulations are too boring for you then check out Jon Bois' ongoing Breaking Madden series, with a  phenomenal Super Bowl special that sets a roster of \"45 superhuman Goliaths\" against a team of \"five-foot-tall baby-people.\" The resulting spectacle is the sort of thing that would usually require some 16th century feudal politics and a particularly deranged child King to bring to life, but thanks to modern technology it's all available as GIFs in your browser.  Enjoy .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
