{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple curates its App Store with the intention of pushing its best software to the top, but with more than 1.4 million apps available on iOS, it's not always easy to know what to look for.  Pinterest wants to change that . The social networking site has today launched App Pins, a feature by which users can stick apps to Pinterest boards that allow other users to download them directly from inside Pinterest.\nPinterest describes the process, suggesting that people pinning workout inspirations to their \"Marathon Training\" board might come across a fitness app that appeals. Using App Pins, they'll be able to grab the app there and then without searching manually through the App Store. The company already has its own Staff Picks board, featuring shopping software Instacart, payment service Square Cash, and a host of other apps available for download through Pinterest on iPad and iPhone.\nFollow Pinterest's board Staff picks on Pinterest.\nApple has paired up with Pinterest for the launch of the new feature. App Pins are currently exclusive to Pinterest's iOS apps with Apple launching its own App Store board today that features a set of specially chosen apps from fashion and shopping categories.\nVisit App Store's profile on Pinterest.\nThe decision to get involved with Pinterest's own way of sifting through the App Store is significant for Apple, which has previously relied on pulling out specific apps and marking them as \"featured\" to show off the best of its online marketplace. The move could also mean a new money-making avenue for Pinterest, as the service could start selling spaces for app developers to buy ads promoting their software \u2014 a business model that has been historically successful for both Twitter and Facebook.\n","Title":"Now you can download iPhone apps directly within Pinterest | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","tech"]}
