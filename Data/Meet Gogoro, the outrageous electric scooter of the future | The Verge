{"Main text":"Meet Gogoro, the outrageous electric scooter of the future\nAnd you can't plug it in\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTaiwanese startup Gogoro is making news today after four years operating in stealth, revealing an electric scooter designed for commuters along with a ridiculously ambitious plan to power it. You don\u2019t plug the scooter in, like you would essentially any other electric vehicle in the world \u2014 instead, Gogoro has its sights set on user-swappable batteries and a vast network of battery swapping stations that could cover some of the most densely populated cities in the world.\nIt\u2019s a little crazy. Actually, it\u2019s a lot crazy.\nI first got a glimpse of the system at an event several weeks ago in San Francisco, where Gogoro CEO Horace Luke worked the room with the charm, energy, and nerves of a man who was revealing his life\u2019s passion for the first time. Luke is a designer by trade with long stints at Nike, Microsoft, and HTC under his belt, and his creative roots show in everything Gogoro has done. The scooter just looks fresh, as if Luke hasn\u2019t designed one before (which is true).\nMaybe it\u2019s the former smartphone designer in him that\u2019s showing through. Luke is joined by a number of former colleagues at HTC, including co-founder Matt Taylor. Cher Wang, HTC\u2019s billionaire founder, counts herself among Gogoro\u2019s investors. The company has raised a total of $150 million, which is now on the line as it tries to convince riders, cities, and anyone else who will listen that it can pull this all off.\nIn reality, I\u2019m deeply skeptical. But if you let Luke rub off on you long enough, you can\u2019t help but believe they\u2019ve got it figured out.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nGogoro's Smartscooter poses in front of a GoStation.\nAt a high level, Gogoro is announcing the Smartscooter. It\u2019s probably the coolest two-wheeled runabout you can buy: it\u2019s electric, looks unlike anything else on the market, and incorporates a host of legitimately unique features. All-LED headlights and taillights with programmable action sequences lend a Knight Rider aesthetic. An always-on Bluetooth connection links into a smartphone companion app, where you can change a variety of vehicle settings. The key, a circular white fob, is completely wireless like in a modern car. You can even download new sounds for startup, shutdown, turn signals, and so on; it\u2019s a bit of an homage to the founders\u2019 roots at HTC, in an industry where ringtones are big business.\nIt\u2019s probably the coolest two-wheeled runabout you can buy\n\"Electric scooter\" inherently sounds safe and slow, but Gogoro is working hard to dispel that image upfront. It\u2019ll reliably do smoky burnouts \u2014 several were demonstrated for me by the company\u2019s test rider \u2014 and it hits 50 km\/h (31 mph) in 4.2 seconds. (It\u2019s surreal seeing a scooter, the icon of practical personal transport, lay a perfect circle of rubber on a public street as the rider slowly pivots the machine on its front wheel.) Top speed is 60 mph, which compares favorably to a Vespa 946\u2019s 57 mph. The company\u2019s promotional video features a black leather-clad badass leaning hard through sweeping turns, superbike-style, dragging his knees on the pavement along the way. Luke says they\u2019re appealing to young riders, and it certainly comes through.\nBut ultimately, it\u2019s just a scooter. The secret sauce is in the infrastructure that lies beneath.\nIt\u2019s not just that you don\u2019t plug the Smartscooter in \u2014 you can\u2019t. When power runs low, you visit charging kiosks placed strategically around a city (Gogoro calls them GoStations) to swap your batteries, a process that only takes a few seconds. The hope is that the company can sell the Smartscooter for the same cost as a premium gasoline model by removing the very expensive cells, instead offering use of the GoStations through a subscription plan. The subscription takes the place of the money you\u2019d otherwise spend on gas; you\u2019re basically paying monthly for the energy. If the \"sharing economy\" is hot right now \u2014 ZipCar, Citibike, so on \u2014 Gogoro wants to establish itself as the de facto battery sharing ecosystem. (The company hasn't announced pricing for either the scooter or the subscription plans yet.)\n\"By 2030, there\u2019s going to be 41 megacities, the majority in the developing world,\" Luke says, pointing to a map centered on Southeast Asia. It\u2019s a region that has succumbed to extreme air pollution in recent years, a victim of industrialization, lax environmental regulation, and a rising middle class with money to spend. It\u2019s also a region that depends on two-wheeled transportation in a way that the Western world never has. Scooters, which flow by the thousands through the clogged streets of metropolises like Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, are ripe targets for slashing smog; many models actually belch more pollutants into the air than a modern sedan .\nThe de facto battery sharing ecosystem\nElectric vehicles are frequently maligned for merely moving the pollution problem elsewhere rather than solving it outright \u2014 you\u2019ve got to produce the electricity somehow, after all \u2014 but Luke and Taylor are well-prepared for the question, insisting that you\u2019re better off burning coal outside of a city to power clean vehicles inside of it. Long term, they note, clean energy probably becomes viable in today\u2019s emerging markets.\nOpened for service, the Smartscooter looks almost alien-like.\nThe batteries have been designed in collaboration with Panasonic, a prolific battery supplier that has enjoyed the EV spotlight in recent years thanks to its partnership with Tesla and an investment in Elon Musk\u2019s vaunted Gigafactory . These are no Tesla batteries, though: each dark gray brick weighs about the same as a bowling ball, equipped with an ergonomic bright green handle on one end. They\u2019re designed to be lugged around by anyone and everyone, but I can imagine really small riders struggling with the heft. Luke and Panasonic EVP Yoshi Yamada seem to be as excited about the batteries as anything else, lauding their NFC authentication, 256-bit encryption (\"banks use 128-bit encryption,\" Luke says), and smart circuitry. Basically, they\u2019ll refuse to charge or discharge unless placed in an authorized device, and they\u2019re completely inert otherwise.\nSwap batteries and get back on the road in under half a minute\nThat circuitry is undoubtedly driven in part by a desire to lock down Gogoro\u2019s ecosystem and render the batteries useless to anyone not using a Gogoro-sanctioned device \u2014 yes, battery DRM \u2014 but it\u2019s also about making the battery swapping experience seamless. The Smartscooter\u2019s bulbous seat lifts to reveal a lighted cargo area and two battery docks. Riders in need of more power would stop at GoStation, grab both batteries from underneath the seat, and slide them into the kiosk\u2019s spring-loaded slots. The machine identifies the rider based on the batteries\u2019 unique IDs, greets them, scans for any warnings or problems that have been recorded (say, a brake light is out or the scooter was dropped since the last swap), offers service options, and ejects a fresh set of batteries, all in the course of about six seconds. I\u2019d guess that an experienced Smartscooter rider could probably stop and be back on the road in under half a minute.\nA Gogoro battery.\nThe concept exploits certain realities about scooters that aren\u2019t necessarily true for other kinds of vehicles. Most importantly, they\u2019re strictly urban machines: you won\u2019t generally ride a scooter cross-country, and you definitely won\u2019t be able to with a Smartscooter. It\u2019s designed to stay inside the footprint of the GoStations that support it. It\u2019ll go 60 miles on a single charge \u2014 not very good compared to a gas model, but the problem is tempered to some degree by how effortless the battery swaps are. A dense network of swapping stations solves electric\u2019s single biggest challenge, which is charge time.\n\"What you\u2019ve seen today could not have been done three or four years ago.\"\nIf Luke is the face of Gogoro, CTO Matt Taylor is the arbiter of reality, the man behind the scenes translating Luke\u2019s fever dreams into tangible results. A lifelong engineer at Motorola and Microsoft before his time at HTC, Taylor spends my briefing burning through spec sheet after spec sheet, datum after datum. It\u2019s as if he has mathematically deduced that Gogoro\u2019s time has come. \"What you\u2019ve seen today could not have been done three or four years ago,\" he beams, noting that everything about the Smartscooter was developed in-house because off-the-shelf components simply weren\u2019t good enough. The liquid-cooled motor is made by Gogoro. So is the unique aluminum frame, which is acoustically enhanced to give the scooter a Jetsons-esque sound as it whizzes by.\nTwo batteries power the Smartscooter for about 60 miles between swaps.\nTaylor also beams when talking about the cloud that connects the GoStations to one another and to the Smartscooters. Everything learns from everything else. Stations with high traffic might be set to charge batteries faster and more frequently, while lower-use stations might wait until late in the night to charge, relieving pressure on strained power grids. As the batteries age, they become less efficient; stations could be set to dispense older batteries to less aggressive drivers. With the smartphone app, drivers can reserve batteries at nearby stations for up to 10 minutes. Luke says there\u2019ll inevitably be times where the station you want doesn\u2019t have charged batteries available, but with careful planning and load balancing, he hopes it won\u2019t happen more than once or twice a year.\nBut therein lies the problem: the way Gogoro works \u2014 and the only way it works \u2014 is by flooding cities with GoStations. \"One station per mile is what we\u2019re looking for,\" Luke says, noting that the company has the capital to roll out to one or two urban areas initially. The kiosks, which cost \"under $10,000\" each, would be owned by Gogoro, not a third party. They can go pretty much anywhere \u2014 they cart in and out, are vandalism-resistant, and screw into place \u2014 but someone still needs to negotiate with property owners to get them deployed and powered. It\u2019s an enormous, expensive task that runs a high risk of bureaucratic inefficiency, and it needs to be repeated ad nauseam for every city where Gogoro wants its scooters. So far, it isn\u2019t naming which cities will launch first, but Southeast Asia is clearly priority one. Luke also seems to take great interest in San Francisco, where our briefing was held. He says there\u2019ll be news on deployments in 2015.\nGogoro envisions an entire \"second life\" for its batteries\nCompany officials are focusing on that initial launch (and for good reason), but there\u2019s more on the horizon. Without offering any details, they say there are other kinds of vehicles in development that would make use of Gogoro\u2019s batteries and stations. I specifically ask about cars, since it doesn\u2019t seem to me that you could effectively power a full-on automobile with a few bowling ball-sized batteries. \"4-wheel is not out of the question at all,\" Luke assures me. He seems more reticent about licensing Gogoro as a platform that other vehicle makers could use, but leaves it open as a possibility.\nAnd when the batteries aren\u2019t good enough to use on the road anymore \u2014 about 70 percent of their new capacity \u2014 Gogoro doesn\u2019t want to recycle them. Instead, it envisions an entire \"second life\" for thousands of cells, powering data centers or homes. Luke thinks there could even be a third life after that, powering lights and small appliances in extremely rural areas of the world. For now, though, he\u2019s just trying to get the scooter launched.\nAt the end of my briefing, I looked back through my notes to fully digest the absurdity of what Gogoro is trying to do: launch a vehicle from a company that has never done so, power it with a worldwide network of proprietary battery vending machines, launch a few more vehicle models, sell old batteries to Google and Facebook, wash, rinse, repeat. Reduce smog, balance power grids, save the world. I can certainly see why it was an appealing alternative to the incremental grind of designing the next smartphone at HTC \u2014 but I can also make an argument that they\u2019re out of their minds.\nI don\u2019t think Luke would disagree, but he\u2019d also argue that you\u2019ve got to be a little crazy to take on something this big. If he\u2019s feeling any late-stage trepidation over the magnitude of the undertaking, he certainly isn\u2019t showing it. \"Everything was about getting it perfect, so we did everything from the ground up.\"\n","Title":"Meet Gogoro, the outrageous electric scooter of the future | The Verge","Tags":["report","transportation","ces-2015"]}
