{"Main text":"Here's a frame-by-frame look at the new Star Wars trailer\nSo many clues, so many questions\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter the long wait from November's last teaser , we've got a new trailer to pick apart for any clues to Star Wars: Episode VII. There were more than a few surprises this time, along with a bunch of new questions. Here's a look at what we saw.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nOne of the first shots is of a wrecked Star Destroyer. Episode VII takes place years after the fall of The Empire, so it's a nice bit of scenery \u2014 unless it's something more.\nAlso making cameo: Darth Vader's robotic skull. But who's the one holding it?\nR2D2 is back, as we knew. The voiceover here says the narrator has The Force, so we can assume this is Luke, dismembered hand and all.\nThe voiceover here says \"my sister has it [The Force].\" Are we looking at Leia? If so, why is someone handing over a lightsaber?\nWe saw the X-Wings flying above water in the last trailer, too, but I could probably watch an entire movie around this sequence. Oscar Isaac is in the pilot's chair again.\nOur heroes are on the run. Are we looking at the new planet announced by J.J. Abrams during the panel?\nHere's another look at your new Stormtroopers \u2014 but what are they marching in front of? What's the logo behind them?\nSome kind of ship is under attack, but why are what appear to be TIE Fighters attacking Stormtroopers? Is there a new player in the Empire game?\nSpiffy armor here, but not many other clues about this Trooper.\nAnd here is our mysterious, lightsaber-wielding Bad Guy again, this time from the front. What are we looking at under that hood?\nSpoiler alert: they make it out alive.\nIf these trailers are any indication, the Millennium Falcon scenes are going to be the moments to beat.\nThe TIE Fighter pilot has gotten a killer makeover since the old days.\nThey're back! This caps off the trailer, with Han saying simply, \"Chewie, we're home.\"\n","Title":"Here's a frame-by-frame look at the new Star Wars trailer | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
