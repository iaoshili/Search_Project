{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLG is indeed putting webOS on a watch.  Android Central has directly confirmed that the smartwatch briefly teased during Audi's CES event is running a build of Open webOS, showing that LG is exploring new uses for the software that extend beyond TVs. During yesterday's presentation, Audi's Ulrich Hackenberg  briefly flashed the unannounced watch to summon a self-driving car to the stage. But a single demonstration made it impossible to figure out the underlying software of LG's new wearable. Android Central managed to track one down, and the settings screen shows \"Open webOS\" clear as day.\nBut there's much more. The settings menu also reveals that LG's new watch will be able to connect to cellular data networks (T-Mobile is pictured), so you won't need to depend on Wi-Fi or a nearby smartphone to use it. Built-in apps include a dialer and messages app, so it seems LG is aiming for the same users that Samsung has pursued with the Gear S. Music, calendar, email, and a health-oriented app are also part of the watch's software, according to Android Central. The device's build quality is reported to exceed that of LG's past few, Android Wear-based products, so we're very eager to hear the full story on this thing. Now that we've seen it, hopefully LG won't wait long before spilling more details.\n","Title":"LG is putting webOS on its new smartwatch | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech","ces-2015"]}
