{"Main text":"Watch this spooky music video shot with a thermal camera\nA great music video for a great song\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHiro Murai directed the  best music video of 2014 , and I suspect he'll direct the best music video of 2015, too. This week, the filmmaker published his new music video for  Earl Sweatshirt's \"Grief.\" Shot entirely with a thermal camera, the footage is moody and unsettling, like watching ghosts pass another day in the abyss.\nMurai likes to finish his videos with wry subversions, short beats that turn everything you've watched to that point on its head. \"Grief\" is no different, though the final tweak is a bit subtler  than previous videos . All to say, stick with the video until the finish.\nWhat a pleasure to watch a director like Murai, an artist who challenges himself with each new project. On one hand, I can't wait to see what he does with a feature length film; on the other hand, I'll miss these short vignettes that arrive on the internet like an unexpected gift.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
