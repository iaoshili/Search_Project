{"Main text":"Apple updates MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pro with faster chips, Thunderbolt 2\n13-inch Retina MacBook Pro gets Apple's new Force Touch trackpad\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAlongside detailing the new MacBook today , Apple updated both its MacBook Air line and 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display with faster Intel chips. Both sets of machines now have fifth-generation i5 and i7 Intel chips out of the gate. And both machines now also have speedier Thunderbolt 2 ports, something that would be markedly more exciting if Apple hadn't basically just thrown Thunderbolt under a busÂ  in favor of USB Type-C .\nNo new trackpads all around\nThere are some differences in the new goodies you get. The 13-inch (but not 11-inch) MacBook Air now has flash memory that Apple says is twice as fast, as well as Intel HD Graphics 6000. And buyers of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display (but not the 15-inch) get the fancy new Force Touch trackpad, which adds haptic feedback and will monitor how much you're pressing down on the keypad to let you customize what kind of presses do what in OS X, partially replacing some of the multi-finger trackpad gestures. Additionally, Apple says some of the changes it's made now bring the rated battery life to 10 hours, up from the previous model's nine.\n13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display\n$1,299 \u2014 2.7 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 128GB flash storage\n$1,499 \u2014 2.7 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB flash storage\n$1,799 \u2014 2.9 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 512GB flash storage\nMacBook Air\n$899 \u2014 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB flash storage\n$1,099 \u2014 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, 256GB flash storage\n13-inch\n$999 - 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, 128GB flash storage\n$1,199 \u2014 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM, 256GB flash storage\nThe updated models join the newly announced MacBook which arrives in April, but are available today.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
