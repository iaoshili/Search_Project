{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHeath Ledger's Joker may soon have a successor on the big screen. Sources with  The Wrap and  The Hollywood Reporter both allege that the 30 Seconds to Mars frontman is being considered for the role of Clown Prince of Crime in DC's Suicide Squad,  due out in theaters in August 2016 . Sources couldn't confirm how far along talks are, and neither Warner Bros. nor Leto's representation would comment on the rumors, so it may be some time before the deal is sealed.\nLeto, following his win at the Oscars earlier this year for his performance in Dallas Buyer's Club, was most recently in the running for the title role in Marvel Doctor Strange, also due out in 2016. However,  since Benedict Cumberbatch has all but officially signed on for that part , that the actor may even be considering playing Batman's iconic nemesis seems like the right move. DC's Suicide Squad is a group of supervillains drafted into government service to take on bigger threats. Seeing as the most recent incarnation of the group includes the Joker's love interest Harley Quinn, it seems reasonable that Mr. J make an appearance. According to The Wrap, Will Smith and Tom Hardy are both in talks for roles in the film, as well, so official announcements shouldn't be far off.\n","Title":"Jared Leto may play the Joker in DC's 'Suicide Squad' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
