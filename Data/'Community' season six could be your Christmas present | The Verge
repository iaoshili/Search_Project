{"Main text":"'Community' season six could be your Christmas present\nDan Harmon says \"a 'Search for Troy' kind of thing\" could be good\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCult TV show Community has dodged the broadcaster's axe , and may be en route towards fulfilling its self-orchestrated \"six seasons and a movie\" meme,  thanks to Yahoo TV . According to The Associated Press , creator Dan Harmon told Comic-Con 2014 attendees that Community would not return until at least Christmas as writing would likely begin in fall. Unlike with so many other on-demand series, there are plans to release the sixth season's 13 episodes on a weekly basis.\nBut fans are likely to be most interested in Harmon's comments about Troy Barnes, the loveable jock-turned-nerd played by Donald Glover. \"Troy's out there somewhere. He may be in peril. That's what movies are made of,\" said Harmon.  The Wrap reports the writer then added that there are currently \"no plans\" to bring a Troy-centric Community movie to the big screen, but believes \"a 'Search for Spock' kind of thing\" could be good. Nothing has been stated either in regards to whether or not Glover will return to Community, which he left early during season five.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
