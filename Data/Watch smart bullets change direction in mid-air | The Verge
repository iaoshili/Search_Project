{"Main text":"Watch smart bullets change direction in mid-air\nThe US military has developed a sniper rifle with guided ammo\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe've seen high-tech guns cropping up in  the private sector , and now the military has taken them to the next level. DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance, or EXACTO, program recently completed its first live test, firing a series of .50-caliber shots that use \"in-flight guidance\" to maneuver to their target.\nThe military  bought six Linux-powered  TrackingPoint rifles earlier this year, but DARPA's version seems to move beyond that. While a TrackingPoint rifle calculates things like gravity and wind and fires when the gun is properly aligned, DARPA's system maneuvers the bullet after it's been shot. A guidance system and maneuverable bullet can \"compensate for any unexpected factors\" such as wind, weather, or a moving target, according to the  EXACTO program page . Another difference: the DARPA project kicks up the size, launching and guiding massive 50-caliber rounds. It's blurry, but the video here gives you some sense of scale.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
