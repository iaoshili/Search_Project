{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat do you do when you're incorrectly reported to be writing a script for Ghostbusters 3? Apparently, you go ahead and write up a bunch of material for it anyway. Screenwriter Max Landis, best known for Chronicle, just  released a 4,700-word treatment for Ghostbusters 3 . At this point, it's essentially fan fiction \u2014 Landis isn't writing a Ghostbusters film, and the new Ghostbusters movies aren't going to be direct sequels \u2014 but this is what Landis says he would have written if he had gotten hired. \"Seeing as it appears the new Ghostbusters franchise will be moving away from the previous films and be a complete reboot,\" he writes, \"I thought it would be fun to release an idea I\u2019d been kicking around for a third movie, turning the first two into a trilogy.\"\n\"I thought it would be fun to release an idea I\u2019d been kicking around for a third movie.\"\nLandis had previously created a \" skeleton \" for a third Ghostbusters, but he says that he never pitched it. The treatment he released today represents an expanded version of that. \"I wrote this for fun as an exercise,\" he writes on Twitter. Landis has previously released personal writing online \u2014 including  an insane, 440-page adaptation of Super Mario World \u2014 so this really appears to be more about having fun with fellow Ghostbusters fans than getting a studio's attention. That said, we've recently seen just how much of an effect online excitement can have in getting things done in Hollywood. This version of Ghostbusters will more than likely never get made now that there are  already two new films in motion, but showing the public what he can do with the franchise is still a pretty good way to sell himself in the future.\nnow, released by popular demand, it's a full treatment for a movie that will never exist, my ghostbusters 3. share if you enjoy.\n","Title":"Screenwriter behind Chronicle just wrote a 4,700-word fan-fic for Ghostbusters 3 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
