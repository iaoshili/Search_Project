In the future, the company may also incorporate knitting, bird feeding, and walks in the park into its repertoire. \"There\u2019s a hypnotic, calming and entertaining quality to Slow TV that is perfect for in-flight entertainment,\" says on-board entertainment manager Richard D\u2019Cruze.\nSlow TV is a television genre popularized in Norway, which pivots around minute-to-minute documentation of everyday activities. Originally televised in 2009, the journey along the Bergen Line drew well over a million viewers. Other notable examples of Slow TV include salmon fishing and a cruise voyage that was aired for about five days straight.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
