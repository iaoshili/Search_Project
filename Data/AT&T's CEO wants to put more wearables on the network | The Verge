{"Main text":"AT&T's CEO wants to put more wearables on the network\nAn interview with AT&T Mobility CEO Glenn Lurie\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGlenn Lurie has a lot of work to do. Successor to the longtime AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph De La Vega, Lurie is leading the carrier into uncharted territory \u2014 a land where glasses, watches, and even thermostats can all be considered connected devices. For years, AT&T Mobility has made its bones on the backs of cell plans and mobile phone subsidies, but Lurie isn't content with just focusing on phones and tablets with technology evolving so rapidly.\nThe former head of emerging devices \u2014 AT&T's IoT division \u2014 Lurie sees connected cars and homes as the next big revenue stream for AT&T, but he's also interested in seeing more wearables connected directly to his company's cell towers. The Verge sat down with Lurie after he spoke at AT&T's annual Developer Conference, held the day before CES kicks off.\nWhen it comes to mobile plans, T-Mobile is cheaper than AT&T and Verizon. Do you see AT&T pricing coming down to match T-Mobile\u2019s?\nThe competitiveness happening in our industry has been there forever. Is it a little more hyper right now? You may argue yes or no, but we\u2019ve been the leader in investing in our networks \u2014 AT&T has invested over $140 billion over the last six years \u2014 and our networks are performing very well. We\u2019re always going to look at what we have to do to be competitive \u2014 it\u2019s not only about rates. We\u2019ve been measured about how we decide to jump in or jump out of all the fun that\u2019s going on in the industry.\nOur customers are giving us good feedback. We\u2019re seeing what others are doing, but we\u2019re always going to look and make sure we\u2019re talking to our customers and make sure we\u2019re being transparent with our customers. When we have to be aggressive, we will.\nDoes T-Mobile worry you?\nIt\u2019s competition. There\u2019s four of us, and I think we respect all of our competition. We look at what they\u2019re doing, as they probably look at what we\u2019re doing. Like I said, we\u2019re going to make very measured decisions about what makes sense. If you go back and look at what happened in 2014, we made our price moves when we felt it was necessary. If you go a few years back, we\u2019ve always been incredibly aggressive, but we\u2019ve also been really on point with what our customers want.\nWe talk to our customers a lot. As you think about some of the fun things we\u2019ve done; Mobile Share Value \u2014 we went into that very hard. With AT&T Next \u2014 we\u2019ve obviously gone hard into that \u2014 and the feedback from our customers has been really, really good. That\u2019s what\u2019s most important to us. It\u2019s not necessarily about what everybody else is doing, it\u2019s about our relationship with our customers, and that\u2019s the focus.\nAT&T Next seemed like a reaction to T-Mobile\u2019s JUMP.\nWe actually have done financing in the past, it\u2019s just a matter of how you do it and what the structure is. The concept of somebody using the \"old way\" to upgrade versus having a financing opportunity where customers can upgrade more often \u2014 our customers told us they wanted it. We went out and built the original Next and saw our customers loving it. We\u2019ve obviously enhanced that, we\u2019ve added Next 24, and some other pieces to it, but the reality is this is all about what our customers want.\nReaction? Competitiveness? Sure, there\u2019s always pieces of that in anything you do. Mobile Share Value and Next have been home runs. They\u2019ve been terrific for us, they\u2019ve been terrific for our results, they\u2019ve been terrific for our churn, and we\u2019re excited about where those go going forward.\nLet\u2019s talk about a third OS, as Android and iOS obviously dominate every carrier. What do you think about Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and others?\nAs I think you know, we are the only carrier who, for really forever, has had every OS. The reason we do that is we have 118 million customers \u2014 you\u2019ve got to give them what they want. Do I think OS competition would be good for the industry? Sure, absolutely.\nThose are all important aspects of our business. I think if you look at BlackBerry\u2019s success for a long time \u2014 and now they\u2019re bringing out new devices \u2014 we have lots of folks on our network that still love BlackBerry. We have lots of folks on our network that think Windows Phone is terrific and easier to use than others. For us it\u2019s about customer choice. If customers tell us they want it, we\u2019re going to have it.\nNow as far as what the folks at Microsoft are doing, and the folks at BlackBerry are doing, and the folks at Apple, we\u2019re obviously working closely with all of them, and are going to continue to help them and be good partners to them based on what are customers tell us they\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s going to be interesting. I think OS competition is good for the industry.\nBack in November, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson responded to President Obama\u2019s statements on net neutrality by saying it may cause AT&T to pull back on its fiber expansion. How does that outlook affect AT&T Mobility?\n\"This will land where it lands.\"\nNet neutrality is a hotly debated topic right now; I think we all know that. The thing as a carrier we have to be focused on is if we\u2019re going to invest $140 billion, we\u2019ve got to be able to make a fair return. There are some pieces of net neutrality that \u2014 as Randall has said, and others in our business and around the industry have said \u2014 would make that very difficult for us. No matter what happens, no matter what the situation, we\u2019re going to have to go out and \u2014 I\u2019m going to go back to it \u2014 it\u2019s about our customers, and we\u2019re going to have to take care of those individuals.\nThis will land where it lands. The bottomline is, the FCC and Mr. Wheeler have some tough decisions to make, and based on whatever decisions they make, we\u2019ll make some decisions and react.\nWhat\u2019s your stance on net neutrality?\nOh, I think our stance is well-documented. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re much different than others in the industry. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens.\nAT&T has a lot of connected devices. Is the Internet of Things and the connected home the next big thing and big revenue stream for AT&T?\nIt\u2019s big. It depends on how you define it \u2014 we define connected devices today as anything other than a smartphone or tablet. Obviously we invested much earlier than others, which is one of the reasons we have over 18 million connected devices on our network. It\u2019s the reason we have a big lead in the automotive space. We announced in Q3 that we had 50 percent share. We\u2019ve been saying for quite a while we think this is the next big thing for the business.\nWhat\u2019s exciting is, the whole show here at CES seems to be about it. Everybody\u2019s talking about the home, cars, the industrial internet \u2014 I think we\u2019re just scratching the surface of the opportunity. For me, I started the emerging devices business eight years ago, and to have us sitting here today and it really being the focus of CES is really exciting.\nYou\u2019ve done some exclusive deals for smartwatches in the past, are you going after that more this year?\nI think the wearable space is an exciting one. Whether you\u2019re talking about an exercise band or glasses or watches, we see that space as being exciting because it needs to solve a problem. We announced our partnership with Timex for the Ironman watch \u2014 that is probably the best example of a standalone device. You can utilize it with your smartphone, but the reality is you\u2019re supposed to leave your smartphone at home and go use that device. It does a whole bunch of great things because it is its own standalone device.\nI think the health care space is an exciting one with wearables. The concept that you could have a band on your arm that really is the hub of your body and allows you to have digital bandages and other devices on your body: these are all things that are happening right now and happening really fast. We\u2019ve partnered with a whole bunch of folks \u2014 you\u2019ll probably see us make some more announcements, even here at the show \u2014 and we\u2019re real excited to get a few of these launched that we have announced.\nFor smartwatches and wearables that aren\u2019t standalone, that rely on tethering to a phone, is that good for AT&T?\nIt\u2019s great. You look at whether it\u2019s the Samsung Gear S or whether it\u2019s Fitbit, they\u2019ve done very, very well, and we do sell those. They are partners of ours. I think bluetooth devices are here to stay. I view the future as starting to go toward more standalone, but obviously it\u2019s going to take time, but I think you\u2019re going to start to see that transition happening in 2015.\n","Title":"AT&T's CEO wants to put more wearables on the network | The Verge","Tags":["interview","tech","ces-2015"]}
