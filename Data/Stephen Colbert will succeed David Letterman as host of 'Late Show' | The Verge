CBS has a five-year contract for Colbert to host.\n\"Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television.\"\nColbert will not be using his signature character \u2014 a caricature of conservative talking heads \u2014 on the new show,  according to The Wall Street Journal . But even without drawing heavily on politics for humor, Colbert has proven himself an impressive host, and CBS appears to be excited about his selection. \"Stephen Colbert is one of the most inventive and respected forces on television,\" CBS CEO Les Moonves says in a statement. Further details of Colbert's Late Show, including where it will be filmed, are not yet being announced.\n\"Stephen has always been a real friend to me. I\u2019m very excited for him, and I\u2019m flattered that CBS chose him,\" Letterman says in a statement,  according to Deadline . \"I also happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.\"\nColbert will continue hosting the Report on Comedy Central for at least eight more months, and it sounds as though his position will end at that time as he begins to transfer over to CBS. \"Comedy Central is proud that the incredibly talented Stephen Colbert has been part of our family for nearly two decades,\" the network tells The Verge in a statement. Colbert has been hosting his own show since 2005 and was previously a correspondent on The Daily Show. \"We look forward to the next eight months of the groundbreaking Colbert Report and wish Stephen the very best.\" It did not say whether the Report will continue in some other form next year.\nThe selection of Colbert appears to be a surprisingly quick turnaround for CBS, with Letterman only publicly announcing his retirement last week. Early rumors  suggested that Colbert was the frontrunner for the position, but it was unclear what CBS was looking for in a new host, who will be facing off against Jimmy Fallon's eclectic segments on The Tonight Show.  The New York Times reports that Colbert's last several contracts with Comedy Central were aligned with Letterman's at CBS, suggesting the network has had its eye on him for some time. \"I\u2019m thrilled and grateful that CBS chose me,\" Colbert says. \"Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to go grind a gap in my front teeth.\"\n#CBS Announces Stephen Colbert As The Next Host  Of \"THE LATE SHOW\" http:\/\/t.co\/ZBsYkV4pK3\n\u2014 CBS Tweet (@CBSTweet) April 10, 2014\nI'd like to welcome the great @StephenAtHome to network late night and also congratulate him on his new name: Jimmy Colbert.\n","Title":"Stephen Colbert will succeed David Letterman as host of 'Late Show' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","breaking","entertainment"]}
