{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis year's American reboot of Godzilla managed to bring in more than $500 million at the box office. Based on that success, Japanese film company Toho is set to reboot its version of the iconic kaiju for 2016, beating the  Gareth Edward-directed American sequel by two years. The film will be the first Godzilla film from the famous production house since 2004.\n\"If not now, when?\"\nBy the sound of it, Toho wants to strike while the iron's hot. \"This is very good timing after the success of the American version this year: if not now, then when?\"  a staffer told The Hollywood Reporter . \"The licensing contract we have with Legendary places no restrictions on us making domestic versions.\"\nConsidering how much money  the well-received Legendary film took in, Toho is clearly excited to use that momentum to create a new series. The last Godzilla movie it made, Godzilla: Final Wars, was an expensive affair meant to celebrate the monster's 50th anniversary, but it took in a measly $12 million at the box office  according to estimates . The new film will hopefully fare better. Toho is even creating the Godzilla Strategic Conference, a consortium of film executives and directors who will manage branding opportunities. That means Japanese fans can expect Godzilla plushies in time for Christmas 2016.\n","Title":"Japan is making its first Godzilla movie in ten years | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
