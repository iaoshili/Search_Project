{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTo-do list app Any.do has released its  third major update today, adding support for Android tablets and making it easier to jump in and out of different lists with a new grid view. The app's stand-out feature in  the crowded market for to-do lists is still the \"Any.do moment\" \u2014 a daily planner that's designed to give users a run-down of their current tasks each morning \u2014 but the update is a nice refresh, adding a few small features and smoothing out the app's overall look and feel. The update doesn't, however, include the mail or notes apps promised by Any.do  nearly two years ago .\nGrid view lets users switch lists quickly.\nIn addition to the new grid view, Any.do version 3.0 also makes collaboration a bit simpler. Sharing lists with multiple users was added in  the app's last major update , but it's now easier to add people and see who's involved, with little portraits for each collaborator displayed at the top of the project. Lists can also now be sorted by time or priority, with Any.do remembering preferences for different lists. (You might want to sort your work list by deadline, for example, but keep your home list sorted by priority.)\nHowever, the app's most capable features are still reserved for paying users, and unless you're shelling out $2.99 a month or $26.99 year, you'll soon find lots of stumbling blocks when using the app. Non-paying users only get five \"moments\" a month, can't share more than one to-do list, and can't upload files greater than 1.5MB in size. Premium users, meanwhile, get unlimited moments and collaborations, and a max file size of 100MB. As usual with to-do list apps, the main priority is getting you hooked on being productive.\nAny.do is now available on iPhones, Android smartphones and tablets, on the web, and as an app for Chrome and Macs.
