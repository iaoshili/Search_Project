{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor wasn't just one of last year's best games, it was quite possibly the best Lord of the Rings game ever released \u2014 and you didn't even need to be a fan of Tolkien's universe to enjoy it . But it always felt like it was missing something. While you ventured into the depths of Mordor, fighting Sauron's forces, you never battled against the Dark Lord himself. But that all changes today.\n\"We wanted to make the most epic boss fight we could imagine.\"\n\"The Bright Lord\" is a new downloadable chapter for the game that takes place a few thousand years before the events of Shadow of Mordor. You play as Celebrimbor, the wraith from the original game that imbued the main character with ghostly powers. He also happens to be the one who forged the One Ring, and the new content lets you explore his story over the course of 10 new missions.\nIt features typical DLC add-ons like new abilities and more powerful enemies, but the most important addition is the Sauron boss battle that concludes the chapter. \"We wanted to make the most epic boss fight we could imagine,\" Michael de Plater, director of design at developer Monolith Productions tells The Verge, \"and Sauron is certainly the major villain of our story.\" You'll also be able to actually use the One Ring itself to do things like turn invisible, and attack enemies while hiding in the shadows.\nThe new content is available today for the Xbox One, PS4, and PC versions of the game for $9.99.\n","Title":"You can finally fight Sauron in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
