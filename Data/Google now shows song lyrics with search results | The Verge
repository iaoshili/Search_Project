{"Main text":"Google now shows song lyrics with search results\nBut currently only for a handful of tracks\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle is making the process of singing along to your favorite songs easier. The search engine  will now provide users in North America with full lyrics for songs  above their search results \u2014 assuming the lyrics are recorded in the Google Play store. Append \"lyrics\" onto the song name of your choice and Google will present a chunk of the words to your selection, directing you to see the full lyrics on the tune's Google Play store page.\nA Google spokesperson confirmed that the company was rolling out the feature in a playful statement: \"There's a feeling you get when you turn to a song and you know that the words have two meanings. Well it's whispered that now if you go search the tune, maybe Google will lead you to reason. Ooh, it makes you wonder...\"\nThe new feature is the latest to be rolled out as part of  Google's Knowledge Graph , a refinement to its search engine designed to allow users to get answers to their queries without having to dig through multiple results. Microsoft's Bing also adopted the same feature earlier in the year, marking a trend that may eventually see the end of the bloated and inaccurate lyrics sites that have previously dominated search results, but it's still the early days: the new results are only available to those who use Google in US English, and at this point in its rollout, only one song from iTunes' current top 10 singles has its lyrics available.\n","Title":"Google now shows song lyrics with search results | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","entertainment"]}
