It\u2019s a pretty big milestone for NIN mastermind Trent Reznor \u2014 most who followed his career through the \u201990s figured he would flame out in the self-destructive fashion detailed in his lyrics long before making it this far. But Reznor kept it together and has made a career out of continuously growing and mutating his act over the last few decades. Pretty Hate Machine now stands an intimate, personal view of an artist figuring out exactly who he\u2019ll be, finding the key components of his sound, and making some entertaining missteps along the way.\nFor my part, I can\u2019t wax poetic and pretend the milestone initially meant a lot to me. When Trent Reznor\u2019s first album hit stores, I was an eight-year-old many years away from a time when pop music would be something that significantly impacted my life. My first exposure to NIN came through 1994\u2019s The Downward Spiral, Reznor\u2019s  unquestioned masterpiece . I turned the angsty age of 13 two weeks after it came out, heard the infectious and tortured \"Closer\" all over the radio, and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. After fully immersing myself in the frighteningly beautiful and masterfully constructed  hell-ride of that album, I went back to see what else Reznor created \u2014 and came across his flawed but fascinating debut.\nPretty Hate Machine is far from a perfect debut album. While most subsequent NIN albums are case studies in sonic construction and have aged reasonably well, PHM sounds dated, very much like a product of the glitz- and glam-fueled \u201980s. It\u2019s cold, mechanical, overly synth-heavy, and lacks the marriage of electronics and analog sounds that have served him so well since. It\u2019s a sound born of Reznor\u2019s inexperience as much as his taste \u2014 he\u2019d go on to become a studio wizard, but here he\u2019s just learning the ropes and showing off only a few hints of the massive, multi-layered soundscapes he\u2019d later become known for.\nVery much a product of the glitz- and glam-fueled \u201980s\nAnd that\u2019s just the music. Reznor has never been known for being a great lyricist, but he\u2019s grown a lot since Pretty Hate Machine \u2014 much of his first album is overly riddled with cliches and melodrama. The album\u2019s first single \"Down In It\" even features a decidedly goofy vocal performance that trends far too close to rapping than you\u2019d expect on an album otherwise filled with angsty music targeted at the goth crowd.\nDespite these flaws, Pretty Hate Machine became a favorite in the NIN community, a badge of credibility you could brandish over those who only knew NIN from its first big radio hits. Among my teenage friends, the endlessly bleak \"Something I Can Never Have\" \u2014 over-the-top in its lyrical misery and also in its depressing musical minimalism \u2014 was the perfect argument for PHM\u2019s status as the definitive NIN album. I\u2019d argue in favor of the more advanced sonic landscape of The Downward Spiral and its far more cohesive lyrical narrative, but at a visceral, gut level, PHM could tap directly our teenage psyches in a way that the more mature and complex Downward Spiral couldn\u2019t.\nthere\u2019s no greater structure here than whatever emotion happeneded to be coursing through Reznor's brain\nOf course, a direct line into teenage angst does not a good album make, but fortunately Pretty Hate Machine has plenty of other qualities in its favor. It\u2019s incredibly rewarding to listen to Reznor working with the constraints he had as a young, unproven musician making an album entirely on his own, even if the sound hasn\u2019t aged as well as I might like. It\u2019s Reznor\u2019s pure id on display, unfettered by any collaborators or other contributors, recorded by himself, with the songs themselves his only sounding board. Reznor\u2019s built a career on being brutally raw, but PHM might be his most simply honest album \u2014 there\u2019s no greater structure here than whatever emotion happened to be coursing through his brain. It\u2019s no coincidence that Reznor\u2019s demo tapes that formed the basis for Pretty Hate Machine were called Purest Feeling.\nAnd while the album itself might not present the most fully-realized versions of its songs, Pretty Hate Machine\u2019s best songs \u2014 \"Head Like a Hole,\" \"Terrible Lie,\" and \"Sin\" \u2014 have been live staples for decades, coming into full bloom on stage in a way that far transcends their humble beginnings on Reznor\u2019s first album. The performances on the album might not be perfect, but many of the songs themselves have more than stood the test of time. Sure, Reznor will never be confused with Bob Dylan, but he also has yet to come up with a chorus more suited to being chanted by thousands of misfits  than the one in \"Head Like a Hole.\" Bow down, indeed.\nTake a careful listen, ignore the somewhat dated recordings, and you\u2019ll see that Pretty Hate Machine manages to showcase nearly  every element that ends up being a hallmark of Reznor's sound for the next 25 years. The synth-heavy, funk laden flourishes, the unbridled anger and defiance towards nearly every societal institution, the minimalist balladry \u2014 it\u2019s all here in its most nascent form. About the only ingredient missing from the mix is the buzz-saw guitar work that became essential when NIN toured the album. Reznor integrated that sound in spades on  1992's Broken EP and by the time he was creating The Downward Spiral, all the elements were in place and combined to stunning effect. PHM gives listeners a great look at everything being explored for the first time.\n25 years on, Pretty Hate Machine manages to endure as an exceptionally intimate demonstration of both the sonic and emotional heights NIN would eventually scale. If Reznor stayed within the boundaries of his first album and never grew or evolved the NIN machine into the world-beating juggernaut it became, PHM would be more of a curiosity from the tail end of the \u201880s. However, there\u2019s little doubt that Reznor\u2019s career far surpassed the humble beginnings seen on this album \u2014 he\u2019s now a Grammy- and Oscar-winning artist who has sold millions of albums, tours across the globe, regularly scores films for David Fincher, and is now happily married with two children. He\u2019s far removed from the lonely loner you hear on Pretty Hate Machine, but the album works well as an inspired, shaky, and brutally honest first step towards the monster that NIN would become.\n","Title":"After 25 years, 'Pretty Hate Machine' is still Trent Reznor's most honest album | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
