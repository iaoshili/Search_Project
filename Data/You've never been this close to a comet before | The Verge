{"Main text":"You've never been this close to a comet before\nRosetta sends first close-up photos of 67P\/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor more than ten years, the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft careened through space in pursuit of the 4km (2.5 miles) wide comet 67P\/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko, which is moving at nearly 55,000 kilometres (34,000 miles) per hour. Last night,  it caught up to its target after travelling 6.4 billion kilometres (3.97 billion miles). Currently just 100km (62 miles) from the comet's surface, Rosetta has been returning  close-up images , some of which show a mosaic of craters, boulders, and steep cliffs.\n\"Our first clear views of the comet have given us plenty to think about,\" said Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor in a statement. \"Is this double-lobed structure built from two separate comets that came together in the Solar System\u2019s history, or is it one comet that has eroded dramatically and asymmetrically over time?\" The next few months will be eventful. Scientists will eventually attempt to have Rosetta orbiting 67P\/CG at 30km (about 18 miles), before possibly moving the spacecraft even closer. Most importantly, preparations will take place to lock down another historical first: landing a man-made object on a comet.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
