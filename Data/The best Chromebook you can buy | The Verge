{"Main text":"The best Chromebook you can buy\nNext time you buy a cheap laptop, look long and hard at Chrome OS\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn the war for PC supremacy, Apple and Microsoft only have eyes for each other. While they haven\u2019t been watching, Google has turned Chromebooks from a sideline player into a completely legitimate way to spend your money. If you\u2019re looking at buying a new computer right now, there\u2019s an extraordinarily good chance that a Chromebook would serve you well.\nThere\u2019s really only one follow-up question to whether or not you should buy a Chromebook: do you live in a web browser? If you spend all your time in Chrome anyway \u2014 you use Gmail or Outlook, Spotify or Pandora, Tumblr or Facebook, Evernote or Pinterest, Flickr or 500px \u2014 you might be surprised how quickly you can obviate the few desktop apps you use now. Unless you work with video or photos, or you\u2019re an avid gamer, a Chromebook has you covered.\nChromebooks also tend to be a lot less expensive than your average Windows or Mac device. It\u2019s hard to make a cheap laptop, though: for every manufacturer that proves you can get a lot of laptop for only a few hundred dollars, another shows just the opposite.\nThe software is the same no matter what you use, so your shopping comes down to a few things. The screen (this is where things tend to vary most). The keyboard and trackpad. The general feel of the device, whether you can tell at first touch or glance how little this thing costs. The processor and resulting performance. The battery life. If you pick wrong, you\u2019ll get what you\u2019d expect from such a cheap computer. If you pick right, you\u2019ll be shocked at how far we\u2019ve come, how much you can get for so little money.\nI\u2019ve had that feeling since the first time I opened up the Toshiba Chromebook 2.\nShot on location at WeWork . Also available on YouTube .\nThe Winner\nToshiba Chromebook 2\nLet\u2019s just be up front: it\u2019s all about the screen. The Chromebook 2 has a 13.3-inch, 1080p screen that offers enough space to get work done and display quality that is almost entirely unparalleled. (Its only real competition is the Chromebook Pixel, which is literally four times the price.) It\u2019s not just the resolution, either: the screen has vivid and accurate colors, excellent viewing angles, and a crisp clarity that doesn\u2019t necessarily come hand-in-hand with high resolutions. It improves everything about this laptop \u2014 watching movies, working on documents, just simply browsing and shopping. It\u2019s all better when it looks better.\nLuckily, Toshiba pairs the great display with at least adequate companion parts across the board. Its Intel Celeron processor and 4GB of RAM aren\u2019t perfect by any stretch \u2014 load ten tabs and watch it stutter \u2014 but they do their job as well as basically any other Chromebook. (The processor Toshiba uses here is made by Intel, which is crucial, but it\u2019s Bay Trail, and thus performs a bit more like a tablet. There\u2019s more to do here.)\nIt gets just shy of eight hours of battery life, which is at least good enough to get you through a marathon meeting or two. There\u2019s an SD slot for expanding the 16GB of internal storage, a pretty decent webcam, and a truly remarkable set of speakers. You\u2019ll be reminded of them by a hideous Skullcandy logo on the palmrest, but it\u2019s worth the trade: these speakers are louder and better than you\u2019ll find on almost any other laptop.\nEven the Chromebook 2\u2019s design is a study in smart compromise. It\u2019s basically a knockoff MacBook Air, with the same spartan silver-with-black-trim body. It\u2019s a little flimsy, and bends just a little too much when you hold it with one hand, but it both looks and feels more expensive than it is.\nThe only thing about the Toshiba Chromebook 2 that blows me away is the screen. But I\u2019d argue that\u2019s the most important thing in a Chromebook, as long as everything else is good enough. Everything else here is good enough; that\u2019s why the Chromebook 2 is worth spending a little bit more money on. It\u2019s the best one you can buy.\nThe best of the smallest\nDell Chromebook 11\nIf building a good Chromebook is mostly about not doing anything poorly (and it is), the Dell Chromebook 11 is the best smaller Chromebook on the market. The 11.6-inch device comes with everything a good Chromebook needs. First and foremost, it\u2019s powered by 4GB of RAM and an Intel processor. That\u2019s good news, as is its battery life; the Chromebook 11 will easily last all day and then some.\nThe Chromebook 11 is well-designed, too, if a bit simple. It\u2019s thin enough and light enough, and its matte gray body looks far more expensive than it is. Even though it\u2019s plastic, it\u2019s shockingly well-made for a cheaper laptop. It also has a clicky, comfortable keyboard and a smooth, responsive trackpad \u2013 though they\u2019re both a little small, as is the case with any 11.6-inch laptop. Ultimately performance matters most, but without a good keyboard and trackpad you\u2019ll be left with a computer you simply don\u2019t like using. Dell delivers nicely.\nWhere you lose with the Chromebook 11 \u2014 as with most Chromebooks, and almost any 11-inch laptop \u2014 is the screen. This Chromebook 11 has a 1366 x 768 display that is only okay, and a huge bezel that makes it look even smaller. It works fine, and for the size it\u2019s as good as you\u2019ll get, but the Chromebook 11 fits better as a travel machine or secondary device than a true, everyday, never-stop-looking-at-this-screen laptop.\nThe Others\n","Title":"The best Chromebook you can buy | The Verge","Tags":["google","review","tech","this-is-my-next\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5691344"]}
