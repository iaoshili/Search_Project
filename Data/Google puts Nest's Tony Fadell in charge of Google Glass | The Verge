{"Main text":"Google puts Nest's Tony Fadell in charge of Google Glass\nThe Glass Explorer Program is being shut down\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe fate of Google Glass has been up in the air these past few months, as developers seem to have stopped paying attention to the new-age eyewear and Glasshole sightings have decreased significantly. But Glass isn't done yet: Google's announcing today Glass is \"graduating\" from the Google X experimental projects incubator to become its own independent division \u2014 a division that will report into Nest's Tony Fadell.  Current Glass head Ivy Ross will retain day-to-day authority, but she'll report to Fadell. Nest itself will remain separate and independent, and Tony will still be in charge there as well.\n\"Early Glass efforts have broken ground and allowed us to learn what\u2019s important to consumers and enterprises alike,\" says Fadell. \"I\u2019m excited to be working with Ivy to provide direction and support as she leads the team and we work together to integrate those learnings into future products. I remain fully committed to Nest and am equally excited about our work there, which continues to accelerate.\"\ntaking over Glass represents the first significant expansion of Fadell's authority at Google\nGrowing up means leaving some things behind, though: the Google Glass Explorer program is being shut down after two years, and there's no word on what the next Glass products might look like. Google says the Glass At Work program will carry on, but overall the company isn't giving any timelines on new products. Consumers still interested in purchasing Glass can do so through January 19th, the company  said in a Google+ post .\nMore broadly, taking over Glass represents the first significant expansion of Fadell's authority since  Google bought Nest for $3.2 billion almost exactly a year ago . It always seemed a given that Google would try and make better use of Fadell's hardware expertise \u2014 before Nest, Fadell was in charge of the iPod and iPhone projects at Apple \u2014 and the troubled Glass project is an interesting place to use his skills to try and crack a new market. (Just think about it: Tony making the HTC- and Motorola-built Nexus phones slightly better won't do a lot, but if he can figure out Glass Google will open up entirely new ways of computing.) If nothing else, it's going to be interesting.\n","Title":"Google puts Nest's Tony Fadell in charge of Google Glass | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
