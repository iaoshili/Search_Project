{"Main text":"LG is about to announce the G Flex 2 smartphone at CES 2015\nA phone that's actually meant to bend\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCES 2015 is about to begin, and of all the companies hawking their future wares, it seems like LG is the one most likely to try to make a big splash. So big, in fact, that the company isn't bothering to hide what's coming, splaying the main hallway outside the show floor with posters for the G Flex 2. Unfortunately, we don't know much about the phone from the poster beyond that it's going to exist, be curved, and use a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. None of those things are exactly surprises, but it's been some time since we've seen a flagship announced at CES.\nPresumably it will be as  flexible as the last one , a feature that seemed silly at the time but maybe could gain some purchase among consumers in 2015. Basically, if your phone is designed to bend, it becomes quite a bit less stressful  when it does bend .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
