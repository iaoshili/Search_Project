{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple announced today that it would offer free repairs for MacBook Pros that have been affected by widely publicized video problems and system failures. Customers who purchased one of the offending machines, sold between 2011 and 2013, can check whether their device is covered using  Apple's dedicated tool , and apply for a repair from February 20th in North America.\nApple is arranging reimbursements if your MacBook was already repaired\nThe technical issues \u2014 which include distorted video and unexpected restarts \u2014 have affected 15 and 17-inch MacBook Pros manufactured in 2011, and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina screens, built in 2012 and 2013. An Apple spokesperson said the company \"found that a small percentage of MacBook Pro models sold between February 2011 and December 2013 may exhibit video issues,\" and confirmed that the machines would be repaired free of charge. The spokesperson said that Apple will contact customers who had previously paid for a repair through Apple or an Apple authorized service provider to arrange for a reimbursement.\nThe company was the target of a class action lawsuit late last year, raised by residents of California and Florida who purchased MacBook Pros between February 2011 and May 2012.  Court documents suggested that the technical problems were caused by the lead-free solder used in the machines, which would cause short circuiting. Apple suffered similar problems with its 2008 MacBook Pros, but where those machines were eventually recalled, the company first attempted to fix its 2011 model with a software patch.\n","Title":"Apple offers free repairs for MacBook Pros with video problems | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
