{"Main text":"Six years ago, Kanye West stormed the MTV Video Music Awards stage and interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech to let people know that Beyoncé deserved to win.\nLast night at the Grammys, Kanye West almost pulled a Kanye again. Almost.\nIt's okay if you missed it live, because Twitter's raison d'être is to provide enough minimally contextual reactions that you can piece together events in real time. Vine helps, too \u2014 in fact, here's what it looked like from the award show itself:\nAt first it seemed like a prank, the way he kind of immediately sauntered off \u2014 a callback to the long-running joke of which he's the center.\n\"You all knew what it meant when \u2018Ye stepped on that stage.\"\nIt was a callback, but Kanye wasn't joking. \"You all knew what it meant when \u2018Ye stepped on that stage,\" he told E! News after the show (via  BuzzFeed ). More importantly, he also said that Beck should've given his award to Beyoncé. \"I just know that the Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us.\"\nLook, it's no secret that the Grammy Awards can be woefully out of step with public opinion (The Atlantic's Speencer Kornhaber has a great piece on \" The Great Grammy Hypocrisy \"). And yes, I, too, expected Beyoncé to win best album. I also hoped she'd win every single award of the night including those she wasn't nominated for. Kanye is right, but it's not Beck, a talented multi-instrumentalist with decades of accolades and a damn good 2014 album, who's at fault here. (To his credit, Beck later  told US Magazine he thought Beyoncé would win, and also that he feels no ill will towards Kanye: \"I still love him and think he's a genius.\")\nAnd though Beyoncé didn't win Best Album, she and husband Jay Z had the best reaction to their longtime friend making a repeat performance.\nWatch it once to take it all in, twice to focus on Jay Z shaking his head in disbelief, and then a third time to see Queen Bey mouth the words \"no, Kanye.\" It's truly the greatest gift from last night.\nBeyoncé ultimately won three awards last night, including best R&B song and best R&B performance for \"Drunk in Love.\"\nVerge Video Archives: BMW i8 Review\n","Title":"Beyoncé and Jay Z had the best reaction to Kanye West interrupting the Grammys | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
