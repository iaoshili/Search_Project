Dig into our top selections for Android apps , Android games , iPhone apps , iPad apps , iOS games , Windows Phone apps , Kindle books , console games , and for your Mac and PC .\nVSCO Cam\nVSCO Cam is the best photo-editing app for iPhone.

VSCO recently added gridded user profiles \u2014 a handsome way to share photos on mobile and the web.\nWunderlist\nIf you\u2019re serious about getting things done, don\u2019t rely on the standard Notes app. Try Wunderlist , our pick for best to-do list app for most people . It\u2019s fast, elegant, and free.\nSnapchat\nSnapchat has a reputation as a \"sexting app,\" because the messages it sends are automatically erased after they\u2019re seen, but we think it\u2019s simply a fantastically fun way to send a quick photo or video to a bunch of friends. The ability to add captions, filters, or draw on your photos before sending them adds charm.\nDay One\nDay One is like a private Twitter, just for you.

Popular with young people, Vine is a place of endless creativity. It\u2019s the social network where people are still having fun.\nLyft\nYou plan on getting drunk on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you\u2019d like to get home without paying bank-breaking surge pricing on Uber. For a friendlier option, consider Lyft \u2014 it\u2019s often cheaper than its rivals, and works just as well.\nPocket\nThere\u2019s so much to read, and so little time to read it. Save the articles you find on your iPhone for later with Pocket , an indispensable DVR for the web. Integration with iOS 8 means you can save to Pocket from Safari, Twitter, and many other apps.\nFacebook Messenger\nFacebook Messenger is the most popular messaging app in the US. This minimal messenger lets you ping friends, send stickers, and start group chats, but its most killer feature is that everyone you know uses Facebook, so reaching someone is easy.\nSunrise\nSunrise is the Google Calendar app Google never made \u2014 a modern take on calendaring that tastefully imports Facebook events, LinkedIn info for event attendees, and past Foursquare check-ins. It also supports iCloud, and soon, Microsoft Exchange.\nFlic\nNow that you\u2019ve got a best-in-class camera on your phone, your camera roll is going to fill up in a hurry. Keep it cleaned up with Flic , which will remind you to go through your shots once a month. Swipe right on the ones you want, and left on the ones you want to delete.\nOvercast\nIn post-Serial America, you have no choice but to become obsessed with podcasts. Apple\u2019s stock Podcasts app is all but unusable, so try this slick alternative from developer Marco Arment. Among other nice features, Overcast is quite good at suggesting new podcasts and individual episodes for you to try based on who you follow on Twitter.\n1Password\nMany of the apps you\u2019re downloading today require logins and passwords. A great way to keep track of them all is 1password , which generates unique passwords and keeps them synced across all your devices.\nDrync\nYou got a bunch of wine for Christmas and want to know if it\u2019s any good. Try Drync \u2014 it\u2019s like Shazam for wine. Just point your camera at the label, and it will tell you what to expect from your bottle. You can even buy wine straight from the app.\nMailbox\nMailbox makes sending email as quick as firing off a text message. This app made waves for the way it compresses your emails on its server, so sending and downloading messages is lightning fast, and for the Snooze function that lets you put off emails for later. Together, these features make Mailbox invaluable.\nDark Sky\nDark Sky is famous for predicting bad weather with uncanny accuracy. A few minutes before it\u2019s about to start raining, Dark Sky will ping you \u2014 and then sure enough, the skies open up just when the app said they would. An invaluable resource for making sure you\u2019re not soaked the next time you head outdoors.\nSoundCloud\nSometimes you just need something to listen to. Almost every time, that something \u2014 podcasts, songs, mashups involving Thomas The Tank Engine and rap music, weird body sounds \u2014 will be in SoundCloud. The app has a great discovery engine, easy ways to save things to listen to, and everything you could ever need to fill your headphones and drown out the world.\nTimehop\nNostalgia is a hell of a drug, and no app delivers it better than Timehop . Each day, it will tell you what you were doing on social media on that day in years past. Old tweets, Facebook statuses, and photos for Throwback Thursday: they\u2019re all here in an irresistible time capsule.\n","Title":"The best apps for your new iPhone | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5007535"]}
