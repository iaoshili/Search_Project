{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs part of Verge Hack Week , we've invited great minds from around Vox Media to contribute their thoughts on the future of everything \u2014 from food to fashion to the written word. In this installment, we welcome Ezra Klein, editor-in-chief of  Vox.com .\nThe future looks good when I read The Verge. The watches are smarter, the televisions are curvier, and the buckets of ice are icier.\nBut honestly, the future looks less good from where I sit in Washington.\nLet me be the voice of pessimism. Silicon Valley is a place where seemingly impossible problems are solved every day, while Washington is a place where solvable problems prove impossible to do anything about. It\u2019s a daily reminder that the problems where we know exactly what to do are often the hardest \u2014 because someone else also knows exactly what to do, and their answer is different, and there\u2019s no natural way to choose between the two.\nThe American political system is rare\nThe American political system is rare. In most every other place it\u2019s been tried, the country has collapsed into constitutional crisis. The reason is relatively simple. As the late sociologist Juan Linz wrote in 1989,  \"no democratic principle exists to resolve disputes between the executive and the legislature about which of the two actually represents the will of the people.\" To put it simply: House Republicans and President Obama both have an equal claim to represent the will of the American people. When they disagree there\u2019s no way to resolve the dispute.\nLinz attributed America\u2019s political success to \"the uniquely diffuse character of American political parties.\" America\u2019s political parties, unlike those in almost every other country, were bizarrely diverse. The Democratic Party, for instance, was home to some of the country\u2019s most liberal politicians \u2014 and to some of its most conservative. The same was true in the Republican Party. The diversity of the two parties made their disagreements more tractable. A few liberal Republicans were always willing to work with the Democrats, and a few conservative Democrats were always willing to work with the Republicans.\nBut that\u2019s over. America\u2019s \"uniquely diffuse\" political parties are, for various reasons, becoming completely ordinary \u2014 which is to say, they\u2019re becoming disciplined organizations pursuing clear, ideological objectives. This is happening faster to the Republican Party than to the Democratic Party, but the trend is unmistakable \u2014 and, for now, inexorable \u2014 on both sides. And it\u2019s breaking American politics. The system is designed to require high levels of compromise. But compromise is increasingly difficult for both sides.\nCompromise is increasingly difficult for both sides\nThere\u2019s much to be optimistic about in the future. But I\u2019m not particularly optimistic about American politics. The polarization has a logic all its own. As the parties pull apart, polarization creeps into American\u2019s personal lives, their media habits, and their political behavior \u2014 all of which makes Americans even more polarized. There\u2019s no obvious force on the horizon to interrupt it. And so there\u2019s no obvious solution for American politics.\nThe good news? Politics isn\u2019t everything.\n","Title":"The future is awesome, unless you're following politics | The Verge","Tags":["policy","editorial","us-world","verge-hack-week-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5813818","5794558"]}
