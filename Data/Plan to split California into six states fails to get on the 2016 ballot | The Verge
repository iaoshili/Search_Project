{"Main text":"Plan to split California into six states fails to get on the 2016 ballot\nDespite claims by the group it had \"more than enough\" signatures\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe enormous state of California will  not be split up into six individual states as part of an initiative that might have made it onto the November 2016 ballot. That proposal failed to get enough votes today,  reports The Los Angeles Times , making an earthquake the more likely candidate for creating divisions in the most populous state in the US. The idea was pitched by venture capitalist Tim Draper late last year as a way to give certain regions of the state better political representation. In  a proposal to the California Attorney General, Draper said the state had become \"ungovernable\" due to the uneven spread of \"enormous and diverse economies.\"\nFollowing the news, the group behind the Six Californias initiative  said it believes it had more than the required number of signatures to make it through, and is reviewing the figures. \"Six Californias collected more than enough signatures to place the initiative on the November 2016 ballot and we are confident that a full check of the signatures would confirm that fact,\" Draper said in a statement. \"The internal verification process conducted by our signature-gathering firm predicted a much higher validity rate than the random sample result.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
