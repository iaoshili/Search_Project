{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt appears the Fantastic Four reboot has finally found its four. According to both  Variety and The Hollywood Reporter , the film is expected to star Kate Mara (House of Cards' Zoe Barnes) as the Invisible Woman, Michael B. Jordan (The Wire's Wallace) as the Human Torch, Miles Teller (Divergent) as Mr. Fantastic, and Jamie Bell (Jumper) as the Thing. While none of the names are quite  as high profile as the actors we've seen attached to other upcoming superhero flicks, Mara is still a particularly catchy name coming off of House of Cards, where she alternately plays both partner and foil to Kevin Spacey's manipulative Frank Underwood. Jordan too is coming off of an acclaimed film, Fruitvale Station, for which he has received a number of best-acting-award nominations.\nFrom the director of 'Chronicle'\nVariety reports that both Mara and Jordan have final deals in place for their roles. Deals for Teller and Bell are reportedly still in the works.\nJosh Trank is set to direct Fantastic Four as his sophomore film. His first picture, the found-footage sci-fi film Chronicle, was released in 2012 to positive reviews. Fantastic Four has reportedly been somewhat delayed alongside rewrites and an extended casting process, but it all suggests that Fox is taking things slow this time around and aiming for a hit. It'll be the studio's second crack at the Fantastic Four, following up two widely panned films in the mid-2000s. Superhero films only kicked into high gear after their release though, and Fox certainly wouldn't mind having a big superhero success besides the X-Men series. Fantastic Four is currently set for release on June 19th, 2015.\n","Title":"'Fantastic Four' reboot cast reportedly finalized, including Kate Mara | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
