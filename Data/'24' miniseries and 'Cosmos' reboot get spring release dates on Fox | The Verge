The show's return has been in the works for a while now, first in the form of a movie and ultimately as this 12-episode miniseries, titled 24: Live Another Day.\nJack and Chloe are back\nWhile a miniseries may seem to oppose the show's premise, Live Another Day will  still air in real time over the course of individual hours , only now time will elapse between each episode. Aside from Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Bauer, Mary Lynn Rajskub's Chloe O'Brian is the only other major returning character \u2014 though that may have to do more with the show's casualty count than the new production's ability to sign actors.\nThis spring will also see the premiere of  Neil deGrasse Tyson's Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey . According to Deadline, the series will debut on Fox on March 9th at 9PM, with bonus footage coming to the National Geographic Channel a day later at 10PM. Tyson's show is a reboot of Carl Sagan's revered Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, a short series with a broad scientific focus that first aired in 1980. Tyson's Cosmos will explore the discovery of physics, with a promise to present complicated concepts in clear ways and with a proper dose of grandeur. It too will be a limited series, with only 13 episodes, though that'll still leave plenty to watch on Fox over the next several months.\n","Title":"'24' miniseries and 'Cosmos' reboot get spring release dates on Fox | The Verge","Tags":["culture","science","entertainment"]}
