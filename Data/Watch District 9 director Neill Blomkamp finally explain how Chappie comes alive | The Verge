{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe've seen  a number of trailers for Chappie, the next  South Africa-set sci-fi movie from District 9 director Neill Blomkamp. We know that it features an increasingly sentient robot in the title role, played by regular Blomkamp collaborator Sharlto Coply, we know Hugh Jackman's going to be piloting his own mech, and we know we'll see zef-hop duo Die Antwoord in major acting roles. It's going to be action-packed, but Blomkamp has kept pretty quiet on the film's premise. How does Chappie gain artificial intelligence, and why? Now, in a new behind-the-scenes featurette, the director and his cast explain all. If you're keen to go into the movie blind, expect minor spoilers in the video, and below.\nChappie is created to be a police droid, but is stolen by programmer Deon \u2014 played by Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel \u2014 before he can hit the streets. Deon, having hit on the technology that could make artificial intelligence possible but having been rebuffed by his employers, reprograms Chappie to give him sentience. From there, the robot escapes, hooks up with Ninja and Yolandi Vi$$er from South African duo Die Antwoord, and starts wearing some serious gold chains around his robo-neck. Hugh Jackman, sporting an impressively bushy mullet, is sent to give chase to the humanoid android in his own mechanized creation.\nWe'll know what happens next very soon \u2014 Chappie opens in the US on March 6th.\n","Title":"Watch District 9 director Neill Blomkamp finally explain how Chappie comes alive | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
