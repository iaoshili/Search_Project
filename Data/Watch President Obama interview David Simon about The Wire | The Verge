{"Main text":"Watch President Obama interview David Simon about The Wire\nOur President has great taste in fictional characters\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe White House's YouTube account just published a video interview between President Obama and reporter, author, and creator of HBO crime drama The Wire, David Simon. Simon is the interviewee, and speaks frankly about the nation's policing problems, from the drug war to over-incarceration. Who's to say why President Obama invited the lead writer from one of his television shows to chat in the White House, but the video feels like an opportunity for Obama to illuminate a number of controversial conversations about changes that need to be made about how our nation polices itself.\nAlso, Omar is President Obama's favorite character.
