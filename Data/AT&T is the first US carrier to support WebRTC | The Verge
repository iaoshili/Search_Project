{"Main text":"Tech\nAT&T is the first US carrier to support WebRTC\nWebRTC will allow AT&T customers to make calls and video chat using their AT&T numbers in the browser\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDuring its annual Developer Summit held the day before CES officially begins, AT&T announced it will be the first carrier in the US to support Web Real-Time Communication, known as WebRTC. The HTML5-based technology allows users to make voice and video calls natively in the browser, without the need for plug-ins commonly used by services like Skype and Google Hangouts.\nAT&T says its Enhanced WebRTC API will allow its customers to use their mobile numbers to make phone calls and video chats from their browser, and transfer those calls to their smartphones without dropping. The company says it will release a beta to developers before it brings the technology to AT&T customers.\nRight now, WebRTC call quality isn't as strong as plug-in-based options like Skype and Google Hangouts, but the technology is still its infancy. The WebRTC API is currently supported by Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Microsoft recently  announced it will support the protocol in Internet Explorer, and is planning to use WebRTC for its  upcoming Skype for Web service . Apple's Safari is the last major browser that hasn't announced support for WebRTC.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
