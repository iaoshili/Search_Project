{"Main text":"This is Sony's answer to Google Glass\nSmartEyeglass is a product of Weird Sony\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile Google seems to have boxed Glass up in a dark, musty corner of Larry Page's attic,  at least for now , Sony is pressing forward with a pair smart glasses (henceforth \"SmartEyeglass\") on display at CES. The SmartEyeglass Developer Edition,  due out in March , feels like a more robust pair of 3D glasses. The display \u2014 available only as a slightly-transparent green hue \u2014 is projected in front of both eyes. There was no weird overlap, and I could close either eye without any jarring effects. Navigating the menu and controlling the device happens via a small handheld remote, which looked like a small hockey puck with a couple of buttons and a \"bite\" missing for your thumb to rest.\nBut while the Developer Edition is consumer-facing,  Sony's SmartEyeglass Attach! prototype is more interesting \u2014 and more directly comparable to Google Glass. As the name suggests, it's meant to \"attach\" to regular glasses (the demo here came pre-attached to Sony's specs). The display, instead of taking up the whole screen, is displayed just outside of your right eye's peripheral \u2014 but unlike the Developer Edition, it displayed full color. The demo we saw was a pre-taped video designed to align with an accompanying TV feed \u2014 it'd show map navigations and count steps, for example, while the on-screen avatar ran and biked across nature.\nSony isn't promising when or even if such a wearable will come out, but Weird Sony concepts are a hallmark of CES, and nonetheless, they're fun to try out.\n","Title":"This is Sony's answer to Google Glass | The Verge","Tags":["hands--on","videos","tech","ces-2015"]}
