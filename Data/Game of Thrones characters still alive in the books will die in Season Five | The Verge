{"Main text":"Game of Thrones characters still alive in the books will die in Season Five\nThis is what you get for reading\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJust because a character is alive in the Game of Thrones books, which are currently chronologically ahead of the TV series, doesn't mean they will survive the upcoming fifth season on HBO. This news comes from author George R.R. Martin, who had this to say in an interview with Showbiz 411 : \"People are going to die who don't die in the books, so even the book readers will be unhappy,\" he said. \"So everybody better be on their toes. [Showrunners] David [Benioff] and D.B. [Weiss] are even bloodier than I am.\"\nOf course, killing off characters on the show at different times than they occurred in the books has a precedent. Who can forget the deaths of REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED.\nMartin didn't provide further clarification about what this news means for the connection between the books and the show, which until this point have been mostly similar in terms of plots. Numerous interviews, both with Martin and the showrunners, have claimed both parties know where their story ends. How they get there, though, could involve different paths.\nSo long as Arya survives and claims the crown, we'll all be okay.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
