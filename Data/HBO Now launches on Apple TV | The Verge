{"Main text":"HBO Now launches on Apple TV\nSign up in April and you get a one-month free trial\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHBO's standalone subscription service, HBO Now, has today launched on Apple TV. The service offers on-demand access to HBO's entire library of original shows and catalog movies for a monthly fee of $14.99. No cable subscription is required. At launch, Apple has an exclusive hold on smartphone and tablet apps for HBO Now \u2014 but that period of exclusivity will reportedly expire in three months. HBO Now can also be watched through web browsers, and you'll get a free month of access if you sign up through an Apple device during the month of April. An iPhone app is also available in the App Store.\nDuring last month's Apple press event, HBO CEO Richard Plepler promised that Now would launch in time for the Game of Thrones season five premiere, which airs this Sunday. That will obviously serve as a significant test for the service's reliability, but for now you've got a few days to comb through HBO's massive vault of content. AppleÂ  slashed the Apple TV's price to $69 in an attempt to drum up sales to go along with the introduction of HBO Now. For those without Apple TV, Dish will begin offering HBO \u2014 not HBO Now \u2014 through its Sling TV service this month, but that'll cost $15 on top of Sling's monthly $20 subscription.\nApple Spring Forward Event: Apple's plans for HBO Now\n","Title":"HBO Now launches on Apple TV | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","hd-home","breaking","tech"]}
