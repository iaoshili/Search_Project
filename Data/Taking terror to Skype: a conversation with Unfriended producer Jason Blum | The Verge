Combining low-budget genre films with studio-level distribution, his company Blumhouse Productions has been responsible for bringing movies like Sinister, Insidious, and the Paranormal Activity series to the big screen \u2014 and oh yeah, he\u2019s also had a hand in Oscar winners like Whiplash, as well.\nBlum\u2019s latest film is Unfriended, which is screening here at SXSW. An online riff on revenge movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer, it takes place entirely on a high school girl\u2019s laptop screen. During a group Skype call, she and five friends are haunted by what appears to be the ghost of a friend that killed herself one year ago, after a bout of cyberbullying. I chatted with Blum in Austin about the origins of Unfriended, why experimenting with formula and format is key to his films, and how virtual reality might be the best (or worst) medium for horror.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\nThis seems to be the Â year where the concept of something taking place on a computer screen is getting mainstreamed. There\u2019s Unfriended, the Modern Family episode from last month\u2026\nIt\u2019s an interesting way to tell a story, because it lets the audience kind of direct the movie. Because you can choose where to look. It\u2019s almost like the way you shoot live TV, you have the director looking at all the cameras, and then he\u2019s like, \"Cut to this, cut to this, cut to this.\" You kinda get to be that person, which I think is interesting.\nEvery movie that we work on, you know, you see it a bunch of times, and frankly after you see it for the fifth time, usually you get bored. And this movie I haven\u2019t gotten to the point where I\u2019m bored when I watch it yet. And I think it\u2019s because you can kind of have a slightly different experience when you see it every time.\nSo how did you originally get involved?\nWe saw a cut \u2014 I think it was pretty close to the cut that screened at that other festival [the 2014 Fantasia International Film Festival] \u2014 and, you know, in the same way that we got involved in Paranormal Activity, I loved it. I thought it was great. We have this really close relationship with Universal where, at the moment, they listen to me. Which may not last. [laughs] \u2026 I checked it out. And I said let\u2019s try to release this.\nDid the concept of a movie on a computer screen appeal to you in particular?\nNo, it was the execution of the concept that appealed to me. Because I think the concept could be really boring. And I found myself really, like, very wrapped up into what was happening on that screen. And that\u2019s hard to do, you know? I found myself really involved. I saw the movie, and I was actually going on a vacation. \u2026 I went from watching the movie to the airport, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the movie. So I guess that\u2019s when it really grabbed me. Because it made me think.\nWhat about it stuck with you?\nThe reason people love movies is because you get to be a spy, right? You get to be a voyeur. And I think it\u2019s so fun. And also, I\u2019m 46 years old, so I have no idea what a 22-year-old or 19-year-old does on a computer. And I just remember watching \u2026 I was, \"Oh, this is what young people do.\" \u2026 That\u2019s the ultimate movie experience, right? When you get to look into someone else\u2019s world that you\u2019re not supposed to look into. And kids have this very intimate relationship with technology. The most intimate, right? Because they put all this personal stuff, their whole life, is there.\nWhat about the cyberbullying aspect of the film? It\u2019s not just a cheap hook; it\u2019s the main thrust of what the movie is about.\nWell I think scary movies work best when they\u2019re relatable, and I think one of the scariest things to young people now is bullying. Either doing it, being on the other end of it, being caught doing it. What is bullying, what isn\u2019t bullying, what\u2019s a joke, what\u2019s not a joke; all those things. So I think the reason the movie is scary is because it\u2019s tackling this issue that\u2019s on the front of people\u2019s minds.\n\"Hollywood looks backwards, and tries to repeat.\"\nAt the premiere screening you mentioned that doing these smaller movies let you experiment formally, with style and presentation. How important is that to keeping the horror genre alive and interesting?\nI think it\u2019s really important. If you go to business school, and you put a product out there in the world, and it\u2019s working, the logic is to keep putting the same product out there. And I think that really bumps up against the creative process \u2014 and moviemaking, generally. And I think that our company really pushes against that. The one thing I try and do, when people say \"what kind of movies do you guys look for,\" the one thing I look for is \"different.\" And I think that\u2019s very antithetical to Hollywood.\nHollywood looks backwards and tries to repeat. And we really try not to do that. We don\u2019t always succeed, but I really think that what we try and do is different. And that\u2019s very against what makes financial sense, right? So the only way to marry those two things is to keep the budgets low. Because if the budgets are low enough, it\u2019s like, \"Alright, fuck it, go try your weird new thing.\" So I think those things are very interconnected.\n(Photograph by Rich Polk\/Getty Images)\nAre there any particular different storytelling concepts that you\u2019d like to try out in a future film? Like in Unfriended, or the found footage approach in the Paranormal Activity movies?\nI think that it\u2019s a mistake to think about [it that way]. Like what I said before, it\u2019s really cool that you\u2019re in the computer of a young girl \u2014 but that\u2019s not why I liked the movie. I liked the movie because it\u2019s executed well. Cause it works, cause you believe it. So I think it\u2019s reverse engineering to think, \"Oh, you know people talk about having a movie that\u2019s interactive with some kind of screen that you\u2019re holding while you\u2019re watching it in the movie theater.\" I\u2019m like, \"Yeah, great. It depends on what the movie is.\"\nI think the story, always \u2014 the story and the characters \u2014 are always the most important thing. There\u2019s a really good story in Unfriended. They\u2019re six very believable kids telling that story. And a new framework is really cool, but I would never look for the framework first. If you look for the framework first and then try to tell a story to match the framework, you\u2019re in trouble.\n\"I'm dying to do a scary thing in virtual reality.\"\nThis may sound a little left field, but since you do experiment: have you played with any of the virtual reality gear out there?\nYes! I\u2019ve seen a bunch of virtual reality movies, or shorts. What do you call them?\n\"Experiences\" is what everybody\u2019s going for. Because they\u2019re not movies, but they\u2019re not games\u2026\nI guess they\u2019re more than shorts, though. I don\u2019t know what the fuck they are. But yes, I\u2019m dying to do a scary thing in virtual reality. I mean, I think it would be too intense. I think you could honestly make something that would just be too much. I think that that\u2019s going to be the challenge, is how to keep it fun and not just too much. \u2026 And we are futzing around with a couple of different things, and hopefully soon we\u2019ll make our own virtual reality experience. But I can\u2019t wait to do it. I think it\u2019s going to be so effective for scary [stuff]. Scary movies and porn, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be most effective for, right?\nThere was a virtual reality version of the game Alien: Isolation last year at E3 , and people had a very strong reaction.\nDid they? Yeah. People are going to throw up, I think.\nBut isn\u2019t that great, if you like scary movies?\nAre you kidding? I can\u2019t wait to do it. It\u2019s going to be terrific.\n","Title":"Taking terror to Skype: a conversation with Unfriended producer Jason Blum | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment","film","sxsw-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7979488"]}
