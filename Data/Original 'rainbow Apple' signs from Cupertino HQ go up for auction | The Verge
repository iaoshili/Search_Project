{"Main text":"Original 'rainbow Apple' signs from Cupertino HQ go up for auction\nValued at over $10,000 due to their unique history and retro charm\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Apple logo is historic, iconic, and now \u2014 in its physical form \u2014 up for auction. A pair of signs that originally graced the walls of the Cupertino company's headquarters are going up for sale in early June and are expected to fetch between $10,000 and $15,000. Both depict the beloved \"rainbow Apple\" mark that was in use from 1977 until the late '90s. The larger sign is made of foam and measures 46 by 49 inches, while the smaller is built out of metal-backed fiberglass and fits a space of 33 by 36 inches.\nThe subtle wear and tear on the signs and their history of being proudly displayed at Apple's HQ \u2014 craquelure and provenance, in the auctioneers' terms \u2014 will surely help push their price up. Though the bitten rainbow apple wasn't the very first logo used by the company, it was introduced shortly after its foundation and graced its most seminal products of the past century. Designed byÂ  Rob Janoff , the silhouetted apple includes a bite on one side to give it a sense of size and a multiplicity of colors to help humanize the company and \"to emphasize Apple II\u2019s unique ability to show images in color.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
