KeyMe, a small lock-and-key startup, is partnering with the 3D printing company Shapeways to let customers 3D print their keys from the KeyMe iOS app and have them delivered almost immediately. Using a digital copy of the key stored in KeyMe's cloud, customers can order keys online and have them delivered. You can get everything from a plastic key for $10, a ridiculous solid gold key for $4,000, and various keys in between. In New York, KeyMe is also offering an emergency lockout key delivery service at physical key cutting kiosks in 7-Eleven and Bed Bath & Beyond stores.\nThis partnership could be both convenient and dangerous. If the system works as planned, it could be a huge help for anyone who needs a key fast, or for anyone who doesn't have time to go to a local hardware store to get a key copied. While KeyMe kiosks require fingerprint identification and the iOS app needs your email to access any information, there's always a chance that something could slip through the cracks. It's a novel approach to a very real problem, but in the long run customers will have to be cautious when storing information in a cloud or phone that can literally open their doors to anyone.\n","Title":"Shapeways and KeyMe partner to 3D print and ship your house keys | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","design"]}
