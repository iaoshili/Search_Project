{"Main text":"Kendrick Lamar's new song King Kunta leaks online\nOff his upcoming album To Pimp A Butterfly\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTo Pimp a Butterfly, Kendrick Lamar's long-awaited follow-up to 2012's good kid m.A.A.d city, will finally arrive later this month. We've already heard the uplifting,  Isley Brothers-sampling track \"i\" and the thunderous, spine-shaking \" The Blacker the Berry ,\" but this week, the  previously teased \"King Kunta\" leaked online.\nThe song is a scattered, '70s-funk-tinged jaunt propped up by slippery percussion and comic sound effects. Lamar works his breathless, scratchy flow through the unstable beat with effortless aggression, making it clear nothing can stall his inevitable takeover: \"I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves.\"\nEverything we've heard so far suggests To Pimp a Butterfly will showcase many sides of Kendrick, and now we've only got to wait a week or so to hear them all. The album art is below.
