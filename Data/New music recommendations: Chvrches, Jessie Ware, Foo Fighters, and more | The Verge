{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvery week, a veritable flood of new music is released to the world, and with it the tyranny of choice rears its ugly head. There's only so many hours in the day, so where do you focus your listening energies? That's where our Verge New Music Recommendations come in: it's our entirely subjective, non-comprehensive attempt to throw the favorite new songs and albums we've stumbled upon this week your way. Of course, we're barely skimming the surface here \u2014 feel free to throw any auditory discoveries you've made this week in the comments, and get busy listening.\nUpdate: As everyone in the world has told us, Run the Jewels 2 dropped last night at around 1:30AM. We'll have a full write-up next week, but here's the first reaction from Ross Miller: \"OHHHHHHHH MY GODDDDDD.\" Listen for yourself, it's a free download .\nThe Budos Band \u2014 Burnt Offering\nThe Budos Band has been churning out gorgeously retro, funk-laced walls of sound powered by a massive horn section for nearly a decade, and their latest album, Burnt Offering, doesn\u2019t stray far from that formula. But it does take some new chances \u2014 while it\u2019s still very much the \u201870s-inspired afro-funk they\u2019re known for, it all sounds slightly more sinister this time out. The healthy dollop of slowed-down stoner-metal is a new look for the band, and it suits them well. \u2014 Nathan Ingraham\nChvrches \u2014 \"Get Away\"\nThere\u2019s no word on when Scottish synth-pop wizards Chvrches will release the follow-up to their excellent debut, The Bones of What You Believe, but fortunately the group has  contributed a new track to a somewhat strange project : it appears on a new, alternate soundtrack to the 2011 film Drive. Regardless of its origins, \"Get Away\" has all the hallmarks of Chvrches best music \u2014 it\u2019s a mid-tempo tune alternating between a minimalist verse and a chorus full of lush electronic soundscapes. There\u2019s more new music from the group coming soon, too \u2014 another new song will appear on the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.  \u2014 N.I.\nCold War Kids \u2014 \"First\"\nFive records in, Cold War Kids don't have many new tricks off their sleeve. But Nathan Willett's voice retains its spooky power \u2014 a soulful intensity that brings life to the band's straightforward indie rock. \"First\" is the standout track on Hold My Home, a breakup anthem that starts with a deceptive jangle before tearing right into a former lover. The lyrics are opaque, but the sound is huge, and it's a nice reminder of the emotion Cold War Kids can conjure when they're on their game. \u2014 Casey Newton\nFoo Fighters \u2014 \"Something From Nothing\"\nDave Grohl\u2019s HBO documentary series Sonic Highways made its debut last week , and now the first track from the Foo Fighters album of the same name is out for all to enjoy. \"Something From Nothing\" was recorded at Electrical Audio in Chicago, where the first episode was shot, and features Chicago native Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick on guitar. It looks like each of the eight tracks on the new album will match up with the episodes from the HBO series, and we're curious to see how the style of the record changes with the band\u2019s travels across America. \u2014 N.I.\niLoveMakonnen and Drake \u2014 \"Tuesday\"\nYou've probably been jamming to iLoveMakonnen's breakout hit for like two months now, ever since Drake dropped a unusually high-pitched verse on top of the already-addictive, slow-moving track. But if you somehow haven't had this on repeat, now's the time to start: the duo just put out a video for \"Tuesday,\" and it's basically just Makonnen and Drake chilling in a club (presumably, on a Tuesday). What's not to like? \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes\nJessie Ware \u2014 \"Keep On Lying\"\nJessie Ware is best known for the kind of sultry, slow-burning R&B that\u2019s best played over candlelight dinner with bae. But tucked into Tough Love, her strong sophomore album, there\u2019s \"Keep On Lying\" \u2014 a bubbly little prayer sung on top of a $10 Casio keyboard loop. This love may not be real, Ware sings, but can\u2019t we keep up the illusion a bit longer? Sounds like a fair trade to us. \u2014 C.N.\nSleater-Kinney \u2014 \"Bury Our Friends\"\nPortlandia\u2019s fifth season might be its last, and Carrie Brownstein is  returning to her main gig : Sleater-Kinney is back after nearly a decade-long hiatus, and the band hasn\u2019t lost a step. \"Bury Our Friends,\" the first single from the upcoming No Cities to Love, is a song that manages to be simultaneously sludgey, uptempo, and catchy. Bands getting together after so many years on break often lose their fastball, so we\u2019re glad to hear S-K sounding as good as ever. \u2014 N.I.\nThe Smashing Pumpkins \u2014 \"Being Beige\"\nNever let it be said that Billy Corgan isn\u2019t a prolific songwriter \u2014 Smashing Pumpkins have two full-length albums ready for release over the next year, with this first track from Monuments to an Elegy arriving this week. It\u2019s notable as the first Smashing Pumpkins song to feature Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee, who Corgan started working with for this project. While Corgan\u2019s output over the last decade has been a mixed bag, this song is a strong mash-up of some of the Pumpkins\u2019 best attributes. The gentle, acoustic intro (reminiscent of the sound on 1998\u2019s recently reissued Adore) leads into a powerful, triumphant chorus, with Lee doing his best approximation of former Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlain. \u2014 N.I.\n","Title":"New music recommendations: Chvrches, Jessie Ware, Foo Fighters, and more | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
