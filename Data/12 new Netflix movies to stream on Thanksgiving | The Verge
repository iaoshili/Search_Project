The trouble is, it isn't always obvious what good films have made their way onto the service just by browsing around. We've taken a look through the past few months' additions to pick out 12 movies \u2014 some new, some classics \u2014 that are worth watching if you haven't gotten around to them yet.\nAction & Drama:\nTotal Recall (1990)\nForget about the recent remake by re-watching the original. Total Recall has a lot of action, some classic Philip K. Dick sci-fi, and plenty of awesome visual effects. Plus, it has Arnold Schwarzenegger at the top of his acting game.\nMad Max\nIf you caught  the trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road earlier this year, then you should understand why you'd want to watch the original if you haven't seen it yet. It's one of the classic dystopias, and \u2014 of course \u2014 it has some awesome car stunts.\nSnowpiercer\nOne of this year's wildest films takes place entirely on an apocalyptic train ride. Snowpiercer is about a rebellion from the lowest class in a dystopian world, who find themselves fighting their way through a futuristic train as they try to get from the back all the way to the front.\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\nIf you plan on catching Mockingjay soon, you may just want a refresher. Catching Fire is as good, if not better, than the first Hunger Games, and it has plenty of action and visual flair to make it worth revisiting.\nDjango Unchained\nIt's everything you want from Quentin Tarantino: stylish, smart, and super bloody. Django Unchained is his first western, and with Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio starring, he puts together a pretty incredible tale.\nBraveheart\nIn the mood for an epic? Braveheart hit Netflix earlier this month, so there's your answer. Just be sure to set aside the time for it \u2014 it runs just shy of three hours.\nComedies:\nAirplane!\nThere's no explanation needed here. As of this month, Airplane! is available to stream on Netflix, and that's good news for comedy fans.\nSilver Linings Playbook\nSilver Linings Playbook received a ton of Oscar nominations a couple years back, including for best picture. It didn't win most of those, but it's still a widely well-received film that's supposed to be a lot more interesting than the average rom-com.\nGalaxy Quest\nGalaxy Quest is both a fun send-up of sci-fi and a fun sci-fi adventure in its own right. It's a parody of Star Trek, fandom, and ridiculous TV that should be a funny watch even if you've never seen an episode of what it's poking fun of.\nSchool of Rock\nThis is actually a super fun movie. The film has Jack Black pretending to be a teacher so that he can make some money and turn a bunch of music students into the perfect bandmates. Hilarity and some sweet music ensues. It's directed by Richard Linklater, who's dealt with student life in films like Dazed and Confused and Boyhood too.\nCool Runnings\nIt's probably safe to assume that you've seen Cool Runnings, so this is more of a heads up: if you want to watch Cool Runnings again, now's your chance. It's been back on Netflix since September.\nGood Morning, Vietnam\nIt's hard to rank Robin Williams' best films, but many would say that Good Morning, Vietnam is way up there. It's a war comedy that gives Williams the privilege of sitting in front of a microphone and just running with it \u2014 and that's a premise that's pretty hard to argue with.\n","Title":"12 new Netflix movies to stream on Thanksgiving | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
