{"Main text":"A 'Twin Peaks' novel will fill fans in on the show's 25-year time gap\n\u201CThe Secret Lives of Twin Peaks\u201D will be released ahead of the show's revival\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere were immediately questions when, earlier this month, it was announced that a \"Twin Peaks\" miniseries is  coming to Showtime . Namely, what had the characters been doing for the past quarter-century? How had the iconic mystery affected the town? Had Dale Cooper's caffeine problem spun out of control?\nWe'll be getting some answers before the new series airs in 2016. A novel, from \"Twin Peaks\" co-creator Mark Frost, is coming next year, and promises to catch us up on what \"happened to the people of that iconic fictional town since we last saw them 25 years ago,\" according to  a statement form the book's publisher, Flatiron Books. The story will also delve deeper into the central mystery of the series, the death of Laura Palmer.\nAs the new \"Twin Peaks\" will pick up in the present day, there will certainly be other fertile ground for the book to explore, such as Log Lady's reactions to Nirvana's In Utero.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
