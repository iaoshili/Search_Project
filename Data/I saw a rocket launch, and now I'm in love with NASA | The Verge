{"Main text":"I saw a rocket launch, and now I'm in love with NASA\nBig ambitions and bigger rockets, what's not to love?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOn January 20th, I witnessed my very first rocket launch \u2014 an Atlas V rocket punching into space to drop a communications satellite for the US Navy into orbit 22,000 miles above Earth. That required about 2.5 million pounds of thrust: a very large explosion that must be precisely controlled in order to be successful. It\u2019s not as ambitious as the things that are coming next, but I found it awe-inspiring all the same.\nFor the last several years, the space program has been in a bit of a lull. The last time NASA sent humans beyond low-Earth orbit was the Apollo program in the 1970s. Since then, the US space agency has focused on sending people to the International Space Station and probes beyond. Actually, the US hasn\u2019t ferried its own astronauts to the ISS since 2011; we\u2019ve hitched rides with Russian cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz. But last April , NASA announced it would begin launching US astronauts itself starting in 2017, and it  awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to do just that.\nNasa is looking more ambitious\nNASA itself is looking more ambitious since the test launch of Orion , an Apollo look-alike designed to carry humans beyond the ISS \u2014 perhaps even as far as Mars. In fact, the agency\u2019s goal is to get to Mars in the 2030s. The agency has been working with new technology, including Microsoft\u2019s Windows Holographic and helicopter drones for Mars; recently, NASA began 3-D printing objects in space. Recently, the agency suggested sending humans to airships floating in Venus\u2019 atmosphere . Obviously, more than a few people are dreaming big.\nAnd it\u2019s not just dreams, either. NASA\u2019s budget rose by 2 percent to $18 billion this year \u2014 more than the agency asked for. Almost $3 billion has been allocated to support NASA\u2019s human spaceflight endeavors.\nAn Atlas V rocket awaits its mission. ( NASA\/Bill Ingalls )\nIt\u2019s not all rosy. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) is overseeing the Senate subcommittee on Space, Science, and Communication. He doesn\u2019t believe in human-caused climate change, which could potentially jeopardize some of NASA\u2019s environmental research. But space is important to his constituency. Private companies including Boeing and SpaceX have operations in Texas, and NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center is located in Houston.\nEven if NASA\u2019s missions face an uphill battle, more countries than ever are participating in space programs; ESA\u2019s nail-biter of a landing on a comet last year suggested that NASA isn\u2019t alone in its audacious goals. Meanwhile, SpaceX, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic, and a handful of others have announced their own ambitions for commercial spaceflight.\nIn other words: Space exploration is back in a very big way.\nThe biggest explosion I've seen in person\nThat message hasn\u2019t necessarily reached everyone. When I told friends that I\u2019d be attending a rocket launch today, they were surprised \u2014 they hadn\u2019t known there was one. In fact, launches have been occurring regularly for a while now. Of course, space isn\u2019t safe or routine. Last year, SpaceX , Orbital Sciences , and Virgin Galactic all had serious accidents within the span of about two months; a test pilot on the Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo was killed.\nAt first, I was worried the Atlas rocket wouldn't launch at all \u2014 wind and interference created delays. But then, a little after 8PM, the hold ended. I was almost queasy from excitement.\nI wasn't ready for how bright the Atlas launch would be. For a few moments, it was daylight again \u2014 even though I was four miles away from the rocket. After the light came the roar: not deafening, but loud. That launch was probably the biggest explosion I've ever seen in person,  and it was definitely cooler than the ones I've seen in the movies.\nI watched the sky until the bright dot faded from view. One thing was very clear to me: I need to go to more rocket launches, because I definitely want to see that again. I'm a simple woman. Huge, planned explosions make me very happy.\nSpace is difficult. That\u2019s exactly why I think it\u2019s exciting. It was astonishing to watch the Atlas rocket leave Earth. I can hardly wait to see what will happen next.\n","Title":"I saw a rocket launch, and now I'm in love with NASA | The Verge","Tags":["report","videos","science","us-world","transportation"]}
