{"Main text":"Apple\u2019s Music app will get a major visual overhaul in iOS 8.4\nBut no sign of Beats\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple's iOS 8.3 update has been out for a few days now, which means it's time for something new. Popping up today on Apple's developer channel is iOS 8.4, which might end up being the last point release we get ahead of iOS 9, which is expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developer conference later this year. New today is a revamped version of the Music app, which is of high interest given reports that Apple plans to relaunch a new version of the Beats streaming music service , which it acquired as part of last year's deal . That's brought more scrutiny not only to what Apple plans to do with iTunes Radio, its Pandora-like streaming service, but also whether some of the experience from the Beats app might make its way into Apple's own Music app.\nThis isn't the music update you're looking for\nEarly indications suggest that most things in the app will be left alone, except for the look and feel. 9to5Mac has posted the release notes (which only developers can see), and the main feature is a \"beautiful\" new design that takes a page from streaming services like Rdio by letting users add their own photos to playlist album covers. The app now also borrows some features from the latest versions of iTunes, with things like a miniplayer with small controls and a peek at what's going to play next:\nThe iOS 8.4 Beta includes an early preview of the the all-new Music app. With powerful features and an elegant new look, enjoying your music is easier than ever.
