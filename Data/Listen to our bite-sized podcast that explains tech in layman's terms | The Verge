{"Main text":"Listen to our bite-sized podcast that explains tech in layman's terms\nThe Verge has a new podcast: What's Tech?\nOh hello there! I didn't see you come in. Go ahead and make yourself at home. I'd offer you a glass of water, but I'm all out.\nA tech podcast for everybody, even your cute dog\nYou want to know about technology? Because you, like millions of others, find tech and the culture around it impenetrable and occasionally unnecessarily complex? And you hate jargon?\nThe good news is I can help with lots of support from colleagues and experts. I recently recorded the first episode of my new podcast, What's Tech?\nHere's the official description from iTunes:\nWe live in the future, where drones skim the sky, corporations enter the space race, and smartwatches track our every movement. But how? And why? What's Tech invites experts to explain the technology bit by bit, in clear, brief, enjoyable audio nuggets. These days, technology is everywhere. Let's make sense of what's around us.\nEach episode is about 15-20 minutes long and explains a specific corner of technology. Snapchat, net neutrality, and Tinder are just some of the early topics. We're premiering with two episodes. For the first episode, my pal, The Verge's Business Editor Ben Popper, told me about drones and how he almost killed a woman and a child. In the second episode, Senior Editor Dan Seifert gets kicked out of an Applebee's, and also explains the rising popularity of the smartwatch. Yes, I'm serious. No, nobody got hurt. Yes, I would love for you to subscribe.\n","Title":"Listen to our bite-sized podcast that explains tech in layman's terms | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","podcast","tech","whatstech"]}
