It's not  Zack Snyder's brand new model , nor is it  Christopher Nolan's tank . Not even  Tim Burton's slick version or the  legendary customized Lincoln used in the \u201960s TV series will do. No, this recently-discovered Batmobile built from a 1956 Oldsmobile is the only real option for lovers of the original comics.\nThe hand-built car is said to be the very first officially-licensed Batmobile ever made, and it's up at auction now for a starting price of $90,000. Unlike all of the other Batmobiles, it evokes the original design used in the 1940s comics: a massive center tail fin, long swooping lines, and a bat face for a front end.\nAccording to Heritage Auctions, the Batmobile was built and designed by 23-year-old Forrest Robinson in a barn in 1960. He completed the project in 1963 after replacing the body of a  1956 Oldsmobile 88 with his own custom design. For the next three years it toured the country as an official promotional vehicle before the George Barris-customized Lincoln Futura concept from the TV show took over. The \u201963 Batmobile was relegated to obscurity and spent nearly 50 years in a field before it was rediscovered and restored in 2008. Now it's looking for a new home.\n","Title":"The first official Batmobile ever built is headed to auction | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","transportation"]}
