{"Main text":"How to explain Snapchat to your parents\nAn app used by millions of people, and possibly misunderstood by just as many\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn August of last year, Snapchat claimed to have over 100 million monthly users. Unlike Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social media apps, I find Snapchat most misunderstood by friends, family, and colleagues. It's a strange, sometimes frustrating self-destructing video messaging service that has branched into text chat and content distribution. But it earned its notorious reputation early on as a delivery method for nudie pics.\nHow did Snapchat get to a reportedÂ  $15 billion valuation ? The Verge's Snapchat expert and maintainer of Therealverge on Snapchat, Sam Sheffer, explains the app that only seems to become more popular.\nAfter you listen to the episode, be sure to follow Sam and the rest of The Verge on Snapchat.
