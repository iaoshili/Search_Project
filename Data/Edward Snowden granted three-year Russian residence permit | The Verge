{"Main text":"Edward Snowden granted three-year Russian residence permit\nTemporary asylum no more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEdward Snowden is staying in Russia for the foreseeable future. Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena confirmed today that Russia has granted the NSA whistleblower a three-year residence permit,  according to Russia Today . He was  given temporary asylum last August, and  applied for an extension last month . Under the terms of the permit, Snowden will be able to travel freely throughout the country, and can travel abroad for up to three months. Staying abroad longer would result in the residence permit being revoked. According to Kuchereena, Snowden did not request political asylum, and will not be able to apply for Russian citizenship until he has lived in the country for five years. He added that Snowden will hold a press conference to discuss the news as soon as it's possible.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
