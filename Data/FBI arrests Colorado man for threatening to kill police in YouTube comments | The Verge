{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDays after the shooting of two New York City Police Department officers, the FBI has announced the arrest of a man who allegedly posted YouTube comments about hunting down and killing police. Yesterday, the Colorado District Attorney's office said it had detained 33-year-old Jeremiah Perez, who is accused of transmitting an online threat in retaliation for the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. On December 17th, Google notified the FBI about a Google+ account called \"Vets Hunting Cops,\" which had commented on a YouTube video. The comment said that since Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown in August, \"our group\" had killed six retired sheriffs and police officers and would \"hunt two more in Colorado this week.\"\nSINCE DARREN WILSON our group has killed 6 retired sheriffs and cops......because of this event we will hunt two more in colorado this week.....for every innocent citizen that cops kill WE, VETERANS WILL KILL RETIRED HELPLESS COPS........we already started and MORE TO COME NOW.......join us and kill any cop or any retired cop !!!!!!! MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE THE PROTEST !!! THEY DONT CARE, SO NOW REAL HEROS WILL HUNT THEM ALL !!! fuck ISIS, COPS ARE THE REAL ENEMIES OF FREEDOM LOVING AMERICANS and TIME TO STRIKE BACK IN ALL OUT WAR IS NOW !!!!\nThe account had made similar previous statements, saying that \"we are armed and getting ready for war, cant [sic] wait to kill you fake patriots on the right.\"\n\"We are armed and getting ready for war.\"\nThe Colorado FBI tracked the IP address of the post and requested the name associated with it through Perez's ISP. After police got a warrant to search his residence, he allegedly confessed, saying that the post was \"the result of misplaced frustration and a way of experimenting with words ... his intent was to engage YouTube viewers in conversation, but not a single person replied to his postings.\" Perez then \"expressed remorse\" for making the threats. While the Google+ post implied that a group of people was hunting police, he allegedly said this was only to lend weight to his words.\nThe FBI says that an investigation of Perez's computer confirmed he made the posts and also showed searches for \"Kill Barack Obama,\" \"Kill Darren Wilson,\" \"Kill Fox News Racist,\" \"Hunt Darren Wilson's Family,\" and \"How to Find Somebody's IP Address Through YouTube.\" Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the man who shot two police officers in Brooklyn on Saturday before killing himself, posted his own threats to Instagram shortly before the killings.\nIf convicted, Perez faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \"If you threaten to kill \u2014 or incite others to kill \u2014 police officers, you will get some very serious attention from this office, the FBI, and other appropriate authorities,\" said US Attorney John Walsh in a statement.\n","Title":"FBI arrests Colorado man for threatening to kill police in YouTube comments | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3611687"]}
