{"Main text":"A workout app made me a better gamer\nI didn\u2019t believe fitness apps had any point until I found one for myself\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAnyone that knows me knows that I like to exercise. I actively enjoy the physical exertion that others might consider a chore or a necessary evil . It's because I can't remember the last day that I went without exercising that I've generally taken a dim view of workout and fitness apps. I\u2019m fine without your help, I thought in my broccoli-addled hubris. This is one part of my life that doesn\u2019t need the aid of a digital assistant. I was, of course, wrong.\nThis past weekend, as I was busy installing and delighting in the novelty of Android 5 on my Nexus 5, I stumbled upon an app in Google\u2019s Play Store called Trackthisforme . It\u2019s ridiculously simple in both its design and function: I just punch in units of whatever it is I want to track and it keeps daily totals that are then turned into pretty line graphs. It\u2019s also ridiculously powerful.\nTough lesson number one: I wasn't exercising as often as I'd imagined\nThe first thing I learned from Trackthisforme is that I don\u2019t work out as much as I think I do. Working from home, I find brief but regular exercises like pushups and squats to be the best way to stay in shape, but it turns out I\u2019ve overestimated the regularity with which I do them. In my mind, I\u2019m doing a set of pushups every hour, but according to Trackthisforme, I\u2019m doing them every two or three hours. I also don\u2019t usually count my reps, instead doing a certain set until my muscles fail or I get bored, but this app quickly disciplined me and \u2014 through my innate fastidiousness about neat round numbers \u2014 got me to do more reps in each set. Two days in and I\u2019ve already got a much better idea of my own habits than I\u2019ve had in all the preceding months.\nHumans typically like numbers best when they are growing. That\u2019s why we obsess over sportspeople\u2019s stats and World of Warcraft hero levels -\u2014 and it\u2019s why I was so immediately and hopelessly addicted to adding more data to Trackthisforme. It\u2019s just plain satisfying to beat your own high score. The brilliant thing is that for me to indulge this habit, I have to become more focused and consistent in the way I do the things that I am tracking. In order to beat myself, I have to become better, which is essentially the entire point of self-improvement.\nBetter health means better everything\nI didn\u2019t expect any of this to make me better at playing video games, though. And yet it has: I\u2019ve lost only two Dota 2 matches all weekend (where a dozen would be a more common number), I\u2019ve set new high scores in Bejeweled 3 (a game that never gets the credit it deserves), and I generally feel sharper and quicker with my reactions than usual. I still don\u2019t get enough sleep and I haven\u2019t changed what I eat; the only thing that\u2019s different is that I\u2019m now paying attention when exercising. I\u2019m also pushing myself that little bit harder and getting out of breath more often, which might be as much as my body needs to give my mental acuity a boost.\nI've never lacked motivation, but now I have rigor and focus too\nThere\u2019s no shortage of studies showing the beneficial relationship between physical activity and brain health. Even though I\u2019ve always been cognizant and motivated to stay active, this app has added a layer of quantified rigor that I\u2019d previously been missing. I can\u2019t be sure if its appeal will stand the test of time, but it has certainly opened my mind to the usefulness of quantifying and gamifying my exercise. Being late to the party isn\u2019t going to stop me from enjoying it.\nNumbers brought clarity and visibility to my daily routine, which in turn helped me quickly improve it. I thought I was doing fine before, but now I feel better and healthier for letting a bit of simple technology into my life. I\u2019m keenly aware that I\u2019m working from a small sample size and could just be enjoying a placebo effect from having another set of numbers I can improve \u2014 this wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as fun without the automated graphs and daily comparisons \u2014 but I don\u2019t really care. Adding this extra game to my life has made me better at everything else that I play, and that\u2019s what matters to me.\n","Title":"A workout app made me a better gamer | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tldr","tech"]}
