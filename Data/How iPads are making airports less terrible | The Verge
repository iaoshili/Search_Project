{"Main text":"How iPads are making airports less terrible\nAn airport-restaurant company will soon have more customer-facing iPads than Apple itself\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat if airports weren\u2019t miserable gauntlets of long lines, heat-lamp food, and ambient anxiety?\nOTG Management, a company that runs airport restaurants, has been redesigning airport facilities around the country using Apple devices and custom software to make travel less hellish. Now the company is turning its attention to Newark Liberty International Airport \u2014 one of the busiest international hubs in the United States.\nOver the next 18 months OTG will install 6,000 iPads on tables, bars, and stations near waiting areas throughout United Airline\u2019s terminal at Newark. Flashing your boarding pass in front of the iPad\u2019s camera pulls up your United profile, with flight information, travel updates, and frequent flier miles. The program, which is opt-in, learns your preferences from your past purchases and recommends things it thinks you might want to buy. If you never buy the orange juice, it will start showing you other options; if you keep buying steak frites, it will show you steak sandwiches. \"This is the game changer for personalization,\" says Albert Lee, OTG\u2019s chief technology officer.\nIt\u2019s a $120 million project that will bring 55 new restaurants to the facility, some quite high-end for an airport. There will be sushi, bahn mi, steak, dim sum, barbecue, a french brasserie, and a ramen pulling station beneath a metal mesh tower. All of them will use the iPad ordering system.\nBeneath the glitzy new hardware, OTG is using iOS to automate its restaurants\u2019 workflows. When you buy something, OTG\u2019s software, called Flo, sends the order directly to an iPad in the kitchen. You pay either with frequent flier miles or with a credit card, swiped at a reader on the table. When the order is up, the kitchen notifies a server through an iPod touch each employee carries. If an order doesn\u2019t get picked up in a timely manner, the system pings the entire staff. \"We have accountability every step of the way to make this a much more efficient process,\" Lee says.\nAs more elements of restaurant and retail work have been automated, it's created new opportunities for employee monitoring \u2014 if software is telling workers what tasks to do, it's easy for it to also tell someone whether those tasks have been done. Managers like it because it provides data on individual performance and creates pressure for employees to pitch customers harder. Of course, it also raises concerns about surveillance of employees.\nLee says the system is a win-win: waiters can serve more tables and get more tips, while customers don\u2019t have to wait to place an order or get a check. \"We think this will elevate the customer experience without requiring them to hire more people,\" Lee says. By automating all the order-taking and bill-delivering, Lee says, they\u2019re allowing waiters to \"have one job and one job only: to keep the customer happy.\" He says that though the system will allow waiters to manage twice as many tables, this doesn\u2019t mean OTG will be hiring fewer workers. Instead, he says, workers will have more time to focus on hospitality. \"We don\u2019t believe in full automation,\" Lee says. \"We believe it\u2019s a hybrid of people and technology.\"\nOTG developed its system for airports, where harried and baggage-laden travelers make speed and convenience paramount, but it\u2019s a preview of what\u2019s to come in the quickly growing fast-casual restaurant industry. Panera and Chili\u2019s recently installed tablet menus, and Chipotle, Taco Bell , and other fast-food companies have dedicated apps for ordering pick-up. Across the industry the trend is toward automating everything but the actual cooking of food, making the purchasing process \"as frictionless as possible,\" as Lee says. Next year, OTG will roll out its Flo system commercially for restaurants outside of the airport.\n\"A funny thing happened along the way,\" says CEO Rick Blatstein. \"We became a technology company.\" He says OTG is in talks with several fast-casual chains about adopting its system.\nOTG started managing airport restaurants in 1996, but the company hit its stride after the introduction of the iPad, growing 70 percent since it first started using the devices in 2011. It now manages over 200 restaurants in 11 airports, including terminals in New York, Minneapolis, Chicago, and Philadelphia. With the United terminal, the company says it will become the largest deployer of customer-facing iPads in the world, using more iPads than Apple uses in its stores. Newark\u2019s terminal will be the single largest deployment in the world and will bring the company\u2019s total number of iPads to around 13,000. OTG also says passengers spend 43 percent more at its terminals than they do on average.\nAt Newark, OTG\u2019s goal is to have iPads spread throughout the terminal, not just at restaurants. You can order anything from anywhere in the airport, and someone will deliver it to you. \"If you see an iPad in a waiting room, and realize you forgot your headphones, you can sit there and someone will bring you a pair of headphones and a beer while you wait,\" Lee says.\nThey\u2019ll have employees distributed throughout the airport who can pick up goods and bring them to you, directed by their iPod touches \u2014 for now. Lee says you can \"connect the dots\" and see the appeal of an Apple Watch for directing employees to the next task.\nOTG is also testing iBeacon, Apple\u2019s Bluetooth Low Energy devices that can precisely locate smartphone users in buildings where GPS doesn\u2019t work. Other airports have been experimenting with using iBeacon to send travel information to passengers and help them navigate the terminal. OTG would use them to dispatch employees to deliver goods throughout the airport.\nIt would turn airports into automated shopping malls, where you sit at your gate and employees deliver your purchases to you. The airport would become like an indoor, small-scale, super-fast version of mobile-enabled commerce in the outside world: Uber for everything, delivered to wherever you\u2019re sitting in a few minutes. If it works, expect to see a lot of the same technologies pop up outside the airport, too.\n","Title":"How iPads are making airports less terrible | The Verge","Tags":["report","design","tech","transportation"]}
