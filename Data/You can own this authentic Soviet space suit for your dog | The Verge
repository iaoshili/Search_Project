{"Main text":"You can own this authentic Soviet space suit for your dog\nAuction also features a cognac bottle signed by the first man in space\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGerman artist and cosmonaut Andreas Hoge has unique tastes in Soviet space memorabilia. His collection ranges from cosmonaut-themed penholders to space cigarettes to one of the rare \"dog space suits\" still in existence today.\nOn September 13th, members of the public will have the opportunity to take home pieces from Hoge's ensemble of artifacts. Some of the more memorable items on sale include a 1961 French cognac bottle that was consumed and signed by the first man in space and an autographed fragment from the space ship Vostok 1. The canine suit, however, is arguably the highlight of the event. Holding an estimated value of \u20AC8,000 (about $10,513), it is described as one of the few of its kind to have survived to the present day, and was reportedly used in the training of Belka and Strelka during the Sputnik 5 mission.\nAsides from canine uniforms and alcoholic containers, the auction also features Hoge's own artistic creations, documents from the Soviet Space Program, a SOKOL KV2-model space suit, and a tube of coffee and milk. Berlin-based Auctionata is handling the event, which is also the company's first space artifact auction.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
