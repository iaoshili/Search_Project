As Motorola\u2019s senior VP of design, he\u2019s overseen a near-total reboot of the company\u2019s design language over the past two years, and the 360 seems like the ultimate embodiment of that: it\u2019s simple, round, and beautiful. It just took a long time to get from a sketch to a store shelf.\nThere are many reasons for that. At a basic level, making a round smartwatch with practically no bezel at all is hard \u2014 it\u2019s a message I got time and time again as I toured Motorola\u2019s Chicago headquarters this week.\n\u201CWe\u2019ve done round before,\u201D says Iqbal Arshad, the senior vice president responsible for Motorola\u2019s entire engineering operation. He gestures to a Motorola Aura at his side, a beautiful and unusual $2,000 novelty that the company briefly sold in the late aughts. Arshad still looks proud of it half a decade later, and he should be: it was the first phone (and possibly the first consumer device) with a high-resolution circular display, long before the Nest thermostat started taking homes by storm. \u201CBut the challenge was how to make a round product without having all the circuitry \u2014 for example, in Aura, that you see at the bottom of the device.\u201D\nEarly Motorola smartwatch concepts used square displays.\nAs Arshad talks, showing off an exploded 360 that\u2019s been splayed into its individual layers of chips, glass, and metal, I realize that this is his art. He talks about the half dollar-sized circuit board with the same energy and nuance that an architect might use to describe an evocative structure \u2014 or like Arshad\u2019s counterpart, Jim Wicks, might gush over a book of leather swatches. He describes how eliminating the bezel required herculean engineering, moving all connections between components to the Z-axis \u2014 vertically through the device, that is, instead of extending beyond the edges of the circuit board \u2014 and turning the stainless steel case itself into an antenna.\nMotorola says that all of this effort went into making the Moto 360 round \u2014 or nearly round, anyway \u2014 because the shape of time is inexorably ingrained into our minds from an early age. Time is round. Design director Dickon Isaacs notes that when you draw a house, you instinctually draw a box with a triangle on top; when you draw a watch, you draw a circle with a strap on either side. \"How do we create something that is not just a piece of technology on your wrist? This is where the whole idea of having a round device on your wrist came from. It\u2019s the notion of time, and time is associated with something round,\" Arshad explains.\nWhen you draw a watch, you draw a circle with a strap on either side\nAnd yet for all the emphasis on time and its physical manifestation, the software that runs on this watch nearly didn\u2019t show it at all. \"I think in some of our early conversations we were even quite provocative and said \u2018Maybe the watch shouldn\u2019t even tell the time,\u2019\" says David Singleton, director of engineering for Android Wear at Google. Brett Lider, Wear\u2019s user experience lead, chimes in. \"Which people laugh at because it seems so ridiculous that a watch wouldn\u2019t tell you the time, but really I don\u2019t need to know that it\u2019s 10:00. I need to know that I need to be in a meeting in two minutes if it\u2019s about to be 10:00. Like, the time really doesn\u2019t matter.\"\n\"That idea of not putting the time there, it lasted a long time,\" Singleton says. To his credit, there\u2019s a sexiness to the notion that the actual numerical time of day doesn\u2019t matter, as long as your phone knows quite literally everything about your schedule \u2014 but sooner or later, Google\u2019s team says that reality set in as the Wear platform took shape. \"Obviously we decided to come up with something that allows you to answer the question, \u2018What time is it?\u2019 as well as know when your next important commitment is.\"\nThat\u2019s good, because a round object on the wrist that couldn\u2019t tell the time would be odd, to say the least.\nDavid Singleton and Brett Lider of Google's Android Wear team play with the Moto 360.\nThe 360 wasn\u2019t always round, though. As we walked through the company\u2019s rapid prototyping facility \u2014 the humming, machine-filled room tasked with pumping out physical copies of designs to see if they\u2019re any good \u2014 Isaacs shows off a handful of early squares and squircles that didn\u2019t make the cut. There\u2019s the whole philosophy about time being round, of course, but there\u2019s the more pragmatic matter of square watches not resting as naturally on the wrist as a round one does. Once they settled on the circle, the team debated making the bezel fat enough to fit the ambient light sensor, but a thinner bezel with a blacked-out chunk missing from the bottom of the display ultimately won out.\nThe 360 could've been a square or a squircle\nAnd in our interviews with the Google team, the gravitation toward round as the natural shape for Android Wear was just as apparent. \"It happens to be that round objects just sit on the wrist better. If you actually look at the bones in the wrist, there\u2019s a knobby bone here that for some people is uncomfortable to wear something that isn\u2019t round,\" Lider says. He mentions the \"fuse\" user interface elements on Wear, the graphical countdowns for cancelable actions that can be found in some screens. \"We thought of wrapping that fuse around the edge of the display, and that was something that we were really excited about from the beginning,\" he says. \"It just feels very different and compelling than your traditional linear bar on a traditional UI.\"\nMotorola experimented with a thicker bezel before settling on a thin one with a blacked-out area on the display.\nMatias Duarte, Google\u2019s colorful vice president of design, admits his preference for the Motorola as Android Wear came together. \"The 360, as you know, has been coming later in the release cycle of this first generation of Android Wear. But throughout the whole cycle, it was the one that you\u2019d see so many people in our development team using,\" he says. \"Even when people are like, \u2018How are you carrying it around? This week\u2019s build you only get two hours battery life!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I know, but I like to wear it.\u2019\"\nNone of this matters if Motorola can\u2019t thrive under Lenovo\u2019s upcoming ownership and sell phones and wearables by the millions. Wicks says he\u2019s excited about the transition, pointing to Lenovo\u2019s love for hardware \u2014 a passion he clearly shares \u2014 and says he\u2019s here to make things actual humans want to buy. \"At a certain point, it\u2019s like, what the hell? I\u2019m not here to design for me, I\u2019m here to design for you. And the tools that are available to us now as designers and as a company are allowing us to do these things \u2014 why would we not do that for people?\"\nNone of this matters if Motorola can\u2019t thrive under Lenovo\u2019s upcoming ownership\nToward the end of the day, I walk by Dickon Isaacs, who offers everyone a heartfelt high-five as they pass through a laboratory doorway like athletes getting pumped to take the field. Win or lose, there\u2019s a palpable sense that this is a company that believes in itself again. \"If you look at successful companies and brands, and you look at what they produce, you\u2019ll see what they\u2019re making kinda seems very much like what their brand stands for, and the way the people and their company operate, right?\" Wicks asks. \"To me, that\u2019s the fun, that\u2019s the inspiring part. That\u2019s what allows you to get over crappy things that happen, the tough things.\"\nAdditional reporting by Josh Lowensohn\n","Title":"Rounding up: the blood, sweat, and tears behind Moto 360 | The Verge","Tags":["google","report","design","tech"]}
