A copy of the Vedas scriptures and the I Ching might be next. \"These three texts are among Earth's most ancient documents, created over 3,000 years ago. They are significant to billions of people,\" said group founder Paul Aouizerate, who is looking to raise \u20AC12 million to \u20AC15 million in funding for the project.\nThese three texts are among Earth's most ancient documents\nThe \"Torah on the Moon\" team is currently looking to partner with one of the entrants in the Google Lunar X Prize \u2014 a $30 million competition challenging participants to successfully land a robot on the moon. It is believed that the group may be in talks with the Barcelona Moon Team, one of the competing parties. This is not the first time that a Google Lunar X Prize hopeful has been contacted about depositing an object on the moon. Two weeks ago, Japanese beverage maker Otsuka announced it will be collaborating with another contestant to place  a can filled with powdered sports drink and children's dreams on Earth's natural satellite.\nNew Scientist writes that the European Space Agency's engineering arm in the Netherlands confirmed that it was commissioned to test the Sefer Torah's capsule. The container is supposed to safeguard the document from radiation and temperature changes for at least 10,000 years. Further details such as the identity of the team that will be working with the \"Torah on the Moon\" initiative are expected to be unveiled in the next few months.\n","Title":"Torah to join the Bible on the surface of the moon | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world"]}
