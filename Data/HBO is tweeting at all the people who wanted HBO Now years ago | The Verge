{"Main text":"HBO is tweeting at all the people who wanted HBO Now years ago\nYou asked for it, and now HBO's hoping you'll stick to your word\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHBO is digging back through years of tweets to publicly call out consumers who vowed they'd pay for a standalone subscription service, which the company will soon deliver in the form of HBO Now. HBO's Twitter account is replying to some messages from as far back as 2012, obviously hoping that everyone who once dreamt of HBO sans cable will now hold true to their word. Every one of the company's replies includes a celebratory GIF sourced from HBO shows past and present including Game of Thrones, Entourage, Six Feet Under, and The Wire.\n@atsmith Hi, Adam.

It'll cost $14.99 per month if you sign up through an Apple device, and the first month will be free for customers who subscribe promptly. Separately, internet TV service Sling TV this week announced that H BO will soon be available for an additional monthly fee of $15, giving fans of the network's shows yet another avenue for watching them. Perhaps it's appropriate that HBO is going way back for these customer replies. Only a few years ago, HBO Now seemed like a far-off dream \u2014 but it's finally almost here.\nApple Spring Forward Event: The announcement of HBO Now\n","Title":"HBO is tweeting at all the people who wanted HBO Now years ago | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech"]}
