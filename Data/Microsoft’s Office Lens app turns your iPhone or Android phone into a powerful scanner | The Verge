{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is bringing one of its impressive Windows Phone apps to iOS and Android today. Office Lens is effectively a portable scanner in your pocket, allowing you to capture pictures of whiteboards, documents, and receipts to save and edit them digitally. While many apps like  Scanner Pro ,  Scanbot , and even Evernote already exist, Microsoft\u2019s unique offering here is Office integration.\nOffice Lens will covert images into Word and PowerPoint files, and even PDF documents. If you take a picture of a document then Word will preserve the layout of the paper document and use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert the image into text. You can also do the same with business cards to generate contacts on a phone. If you\u2019ve taken a photo of a whiteboard then there\u2019s some truly powerful things Office Lens will do. Images can be automatically cropped and rotated, and PowerPoint will even convert hand-drawn whiteboard images into objects that can be moved, resized, colored, and edited fully.\nIf you\u2019re taking pictures of receipts, business cards, menus, whiteboards, or even sticky notes then Office Lens will automatically crop, enhance, and clean up the image and export it to OneNote or OneDrive as a JPEG image, or Word, PowerPoint, and PDF document. Microsoft is launching an iPhone version of Office Lens today and a preview of the Android app until it's ready to roll out broadly to the Google Play Store. It\u2019s the latest example of  Microsoft\u2019s focus on iOS and Android apps , or as the company calls it:  mobile-first .\nVerge Video: Project Spartan, the successor to Internet Explorer\n","Title":"Microsoft\u2019s Office Lens app turns your iPhone or Android phone into a powerful scanner | The Verge","Tags":["apple","microsoft","google","apps","tech"]}
