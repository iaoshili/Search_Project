{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCES is all about sensory overload. Everything we see, touch, and even taste is amplified here, all in service of products that line these halls for as far as the eye can see. And what do we hear? A chorus of clashing melodies riding atop the din of excited press, buyers, and fans waiting for just a glimpse of the near future. If you're not at some keynote or event, it's easy enough to let this noise wash over you as you turn your gaze to the future. But if you listen closely, you'll get a sense of what moves the minds behind CES right now.\nThey, too, are into Apocalypse Pop .\nCES is dead, butÂ  the dream remains . And as we take our flights home, what sticks with us are the songs, the ones we heard at the Las Vegas Convention Center, deep in the bowels of the Venetian, and during those countless cab rides in between. They could have spoken to some deeper meaning Panasonic was trying to mine, or, hey, they could have just sounded amazing on the Strip. In any case, here's just a small sampling of everything we heard this week. Until next year...\nHozier - Take Me to Church\nKiesza - Hideaway\nIcona Pop - I Love It feat.
