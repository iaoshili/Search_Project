{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs a child, you may have been pretty proud of yourself for making your own chimes out of drinking glasses filled with varying levels of water. But that pales in comparison to \" Sound Pegs ,\" the new percussion instrument devised by London designer Nick Brennan: simple wooden clips that attach to and turn virtually any common household object \u2013 from books to plants to Christmas decorations \u2013 into a drum.\nSound Pegs work by clipping onto an object and detecting the vibrations that result from hitting said object with a drumstick. The vibrations are passed through wires to a small computer, which assigns each vibration pattern its own unique sound. The sounds are played back in realtime through a portable speaker system, giving the musician a fully responsive experience.\nThis certainly isn't the first time that we've seen inventive minds come up with simple ways to make music from everyday objects, but it's always wonderful to watch. Some musicians have even made  some incredible work with nothing but a contact mic setup like this and a set of vegetables, and you can try another similar system for yourself thanks to  a new Kickstarter project .\nIf you want to see Sound Pegs in action, though, Brennan's posted two videos so you can watch and listen. Sure, the sounds can often be strange and disarming, and Sound Pegs may not show up on stage at a concert anytime soon, but you have to admit, they're way more advanced than your air guitar.\n","Title":"Turn any object into an instrument with 'Sound Pegs' | The Verge","Tags":["design"]}
