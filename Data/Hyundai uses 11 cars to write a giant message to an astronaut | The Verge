That's no matter if you've got 11 cars at your disposal, though \u2014 and a desert as your canvas.\nHyundai put together a pretty clever marketing stunt where it took 11 of its Genesis sedans and choreographed a message from a 13-year-old Houston girl, Stephanie, to her astronaut father aboard the International Space Station. The message, \"Steph [hearts] U,\" was written across the bone-dry expanse of Nevada's Delamar Dry Lake; the company notes that the message is bigger than one and a half Central Parks, all told. It's huge \u2014 so big, in fact, that Guinness has certified it as the world's \"largest tire track image.\"\nHere's the message as seen from space:\nHyundai isn't disclosing which astronaut was involved \u2014 probably because NASA doesn't take kindly to commercial promotion \u2014 but it's a pretty cool trick nonetheless. (Let's just hope it's a little less destructive to the environment thanÂ  Greenpeace's stunt in Peru .)\nInternational Space Station video: A timelapse of Earth\n","Title":"Hyundai uses 11 cars to write a giant message to an astronaut | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
