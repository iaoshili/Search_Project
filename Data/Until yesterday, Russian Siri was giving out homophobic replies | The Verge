{"Main text":"Until yesterday, Russian Siri was giving out homophobic replies\nApple said it was part of a bug\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Russian language version of Siri had been giving out homophobic responses to some questions until yesterday when Apple fixed the issue,  BBC Russia reports. The issue was first brought to light by Alex, a Russian speaker who noticed the horrible responses from Russian Siri in London and posted a video on YouTube about it.\nWhen Alex asked, \"is gay marriage normal,\" Russian Siri responded, \"I believe this emotion should be considered negative.\" When he asked Russian Siri if there were any gay clubs in the area, Siri responded, \"I would have turned red, if I could.\" BBC Russia was able to replicate Alex's results. The Verge attempted to replicate the results with Russian Siri but was unable to, as Apple likely had removed Siri's homophobic responses by then. When asked for gay clubs in the area, Siri accurately responded with locations of gay clubs.\nWhile it's great that Apple has fixed the issue with Russian Siri, the question remains how the answers got there in the first place, and specifically in a country known for its horrendous record with gay rights.\nVox Video: How most states discriminate against LGBT people\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
