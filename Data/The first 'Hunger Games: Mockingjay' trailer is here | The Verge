{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Hunger Games filmmakers started with strong design cues. Trilogy author Suzanne Collins gave them a list of surprisingly specific settings (various districts devoted to grain, fishing, textiles, and nuclear weapons), detailed visual descriptions, even a logo. And they've run with that material to an impressive extent. Catching Fire, the last installment, successfully reveled in all the things it condemned: nothing is so arresting as watching a gorgeous blockbuster about the dangerous propagandistic power of aesthetics, mass media, and narrative. The series has gotten as far as it has in part because it's consciously, ironically cast us in the role of corrupt and beauty-obsessed Capitol citizens, relying on advertising that keeps up the pretense of coming straight from Panem. That's how you get things like the  Hunger Games makeup collection .\nThe campaign for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is continuing this trend, starting with a high-production  series of posters \"saluting\" the districts that it's ruthlessly suppressing. Its first teaser trailer is more overtly sinister, beginning with a soft-focus public address from villainous President Snow and quickly shifting into the kind of threat that's appropriate for the leader of a country that regularly televises the creative and bloody murder of children. He's also sitting next to Katness' hapless partner Peeta, who was captured at the end of Catching Fire. The film will be out on November 21st of this year, with Mockingjay Part 2 concluding the series in November of 2015.\n","Title":"The first 'Hunger Games: Mockingjay' trailer is here | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
