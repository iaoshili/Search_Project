The film follows Brand's rise to fame, his battles with addiction, and the breakdown of his relationship with Katy Perry.  In an interview with Indiewire , Timoner said that Brand was never entirely comfortable with her uncompromising portrait of him, but nevertheless allowed her to make it. \"I don't know if he'll ever really be at peace with it,\" she said.\nBrand was also scheduled to give a keynote address tonight, titled \"The Revolution Will Be Televised,\" but that too has been cancelled, and SXSW's organizers  haven't yet found another lanky English comedian to replace him.\n","Title":"Russell Brand bails on SXSW: documentary about his life too 'painful and sad' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","sxsw-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7979488"]}
