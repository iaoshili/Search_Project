{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJ.J. Abrams isn't happy about the Star Wars: Episode VII set leaks  over the past few days , but he's having some fun while trying to keep fans guessing about what will and won't end up in the movie. In a photo  posted by his production company , Bad Robot, a memo written by Abrams addresses images that circulated yesterday  seeming to show the Millennium Falcon under construction . \"I wish people would stop leaking photos from Episode VII,\" Abrams writes, \"And making ridiculous claims that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie.\"\n\"ridiculous claims that the Millennium Falcon is in the movie\"\nThe Falcon's use in the movie might be ridiculous given how dated it would be by the events of the new film. But it's not that ridiculous, and Abrams is willing to admit it: his memo is sitting on top of a battered hologame table, just like the one we've seen on board the Falcon in the original trilogy, used for playing a chess-like game with holographic creatures (as seen in the clip below).\nIt'll be hard for Abrams to clamp down on leaks from here out. With how many people are on set \u2014 between actors, camera crew, set builders, and so on \u2014 it'll be near impossible to ensure that nothing unwanted gets out. Abrams clearly wants the film to be a surprise, but at least when he's in control of what gets out, he can have a lot more fun with it.\n","Title":"J.J.
