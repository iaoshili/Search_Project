Its latest step appears to be a \"Quality filter,\" first noticed by Anil Dash, that will curate your timeline in an attempt to hide unwanted messages. The filter \"aims to remove all tweets from your notifications timeline that contain threats, offensive or abuse language, duplicate content, or are sent from suspicious accounts.\"\nWell, that's an interesting & welcome addition, Twitter!

It uses filters similar to the \"tailored\" notifications that verified users previously could use. Last week, Twitter introduced changes to its harassment reporting tools that  make it easier to alert authorities about threats to personal safety and flag other tweets that warrant immediate attention from law enforcement.\nUpdate, 6:49PM ET: This post has been updated with new information from Twitter.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
