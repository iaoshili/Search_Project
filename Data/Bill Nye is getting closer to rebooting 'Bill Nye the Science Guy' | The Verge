{"Main text":"Bill Nye is getting closer to rebooting 'Bill Nye the Science Guy'\nBut he isn't quite there just yet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast we heard, Bill Nye, of 1990s program Bill Nye the Science Guy fame, was  teasing a reboot of his show. But there were conditions: \"it would have to be with the right producers, and it would have to be a less unfavorable contract.\" Now, in some good news for fans, that reboot may be inching a little closer to reality.\nWhen asked about the show's status in  an interview with Engadget , Nye said, \"People talk about it all the time; I'm going to a meeting tomorrow. We'll see if that works out.\" He does have the rights to Bill Nye the Science Guy, he told the site, but added that when the show aired \"was a special time,\" and now, with science shows popping up regularly on the web, there's more competition than ever. \"Now there are millions, just literally millions of competitors. Certainly tens of thousands.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
