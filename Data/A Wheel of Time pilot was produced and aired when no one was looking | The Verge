{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you were watching FXX at 1:30AM ET last night and are a fan of Robert Jordan\u2019s 10,000-page fantasy epic, The Wheel of Time, you were treated to an unusual surprise: the half-hour pilot of The Wheel of Time: Winter Dragon. Furthermore, you weren\u2019t alone; in a  statement released earlier today by Jordan\u2019s editor and widow, Harriet McDougal, the pilot that aired was produced without any knowledge or cooperation from either her or Jordan\u2019s estate.\nMcDougal explains that \"Bandersnatch [Jordan's estate] has an existing contract with Universal Pictures that grants television rights [to The Wheel of Time] to them until this Wednesday, February 11th \u2014 at which point these rights revert to Bandersnatch.\"\nthe pilot that aired last night happened without involvement of jordan's estate\nIt appears Universal had been working with Red Eagle Entertainment to bring the series to the screen when they received the rights in 2008. However, the terms of Universal's contract with Jordan's estate and their involvement with Red Eagle Entertainment's pilot still remain unclear. Rick Selvage, the CEO of Red Eagle Entertainment, stated in  an interview with io9 that the timing of the pilot was a factor in its sudden airing, and that it should be viewed as \"a pilot for a high-budget production television series,\" with more announcements coming soon.\nThe Wheel of Time is an epic fantasy series written by Robert Jordan and later concluded by author Brandon Sanderson after Jordan\u2019s death in 2007. It spans over 14 books and details the story of Rand al\u2019Thor, the Dragon Reborn. The pilot itself portrays the events of the prologue to the first book, The Eye of the World, depicting events and characters from hundreds of years before the series is set.\nWith the massive popularity of Game of Thrones, itself famously adapted from George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire books, it\u2019s easy to see why Red Eagle Entertainment would want to attempt to keep their rights to a similar epic fantasy series in an attempt to produce a TV series farther down the road. It's a shame it had to have been done in such a clandestine manner.\n","Title":"A Wheel of Time pilot was produced and aired when no one was looking | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
