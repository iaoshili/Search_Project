{"Main text":"Kanye West and Taylor Swift to make beautiful music together\nWe've come a long way from the 2009 VMAs\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen Kanye West stole the mic from Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs, an inextricable cosmic bond was formed between two seemingly diametrically opposed artists. It made the phrase \"Imma let you finish\" a permanent part of the popular lexicon. It gave Swift years of persecution complex mileage. Now, more than five years later, it appears that bond will manifest itself the way it perhaps was always destined to: a hot collabo.\nThis morning on  On Air With Ryan Seacrest , West announced that he and Swift would be collaborating musically. \"She wants to get in the studio and we\u2019re definitely going to go in,\" West told Seacrest. \"Any artist with an amazing point of view, perspective, fan base, I\u2019m down to get in the studio and work.\" Kanye didn't elaborate too much on the whens or hows \u2014 his upcoming 2015 album is  reportedly finished , but without an official release date there may be time to sneak a bonus track or two on there.\nIn the interview, West also discussed his feigned mic-grab from Beck at the Grammys this past week (itself a re-memeing of his VMAs moment with Swift) \u2014 \"It was kind of a joke, like the Grammys themselves.\" Boom.\nCultural context aside, it's a little hard to imagine what the pairing of Swift and West would yield sonically. But then, we might have said the same thing about Sir Paul McCartney a few months ago, and look how that turned out. Still, it's going to be awfully hard to make this (whatever \"this\" is) transcend its gimmicky premise. (The music video is an easier proposition. Close your eyes and you can already see Swift and her ballerina girl gang  dancing too enthusiastically behind an unsmiling 'Ye.)\nRegardless of the outcome, it's nice to see these two kids burying the hatchet. We've come a long way from 2009.\n","Title":"Kanye West and Taylor Swift to make beautiful music together | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","music"]}
