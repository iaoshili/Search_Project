{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPaid features for dating app Tinder that will let you undo accidental rejections and search for people in different areas are one step closer to arriving in the US. Today, Tinder accidentally released an update to  its iOS app noting that both features \u2014 which were announced back in November \u2014 were present in its latest build, however those mentions were quickly retracted.  Speaking to TechCrunch , Tinder now says that it's on track to bring both items to its app in the US by mid- to late-March, though it hasn't put a dollar figure on just how much it will actually cost users.\nThe features in question let you fix Tinder's core functionality, allowing you to undo swiping left on someone's profile, which rejects them from being a potential match. That happens if you're using the app too quickly, or have a change of heart. The other, which Tinder calls Passport, lets you use the service in a different city than your current location, something users have been clamoring for. The company's already been testing both features in Brazil, Germany, and the UK for months as part of a paid monthly service. In the UK at least, the company's also been toying with limiting the amount of likes you can dole out, a cap that's lifted with its paid plus service.\n","Title":"An undo button is finally coming to Tinder, but you'll have to pay for it | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
