{"Main text":"266 Comments\nThere was a time \u2014 and it really wasn\u2019t that long ago \u2014 when you could say that Michael Bay made good movies with a straight face. Action flicks like The Rock, Bad Boys, and Armageddon were never seen as capital-c Cinema, but they were incredibly entertaining and bombastic summer rides, packed with an attention to visual detail and style that were uniquely the director\u2019s own. In many ways, he was the second coming of Tony Scott, reinventing the action movie for a generation that wanted bigger, louder, faster, more.\nAnd then Transformers happened. (Well, Pearl Harbor happened first, but Bad Boys 2 was a delightfully insane course correction.) With giant robots taking center stage, the Hasbro toy adaptations have lacked any semblance of coherent story or characters, leaving audiences with little to hold on to beyond the visuals \u2014 save for the gut-level disdain many felt for Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. But with Transformers: Age of Extinction, it's felt like that could be changing. There's Mark Wahlberg, injecting new blood and a new dynamic into the mix. There's the introduction of the Dinobots, creatures so bizarre that they seem uniquely suited to the director\u2019s larger-than-life sensibilities. And there's Bay himself, who recently stretched outside his comfort zone with Pain & Gain. As the lights went down in the theater, I thought that this might be the Transformers film to break the cycle, upending all expectations by actually being good.\nI was wrong.\nMark Wahlberg becomes the last ally of the Autobots\nAge of Extinction picks up several years after the last entry, 2011\u2019s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In case you don\u2019t remember, that movie ended with the Autobots victorious in a battle that laid waste to much of Chicago, Optimus Prime intoning that he would always protect Earth and its inhabitants. As it turns out, not so much. The Chicago battle has convinced humanity that all Transformers are bad, and the Autobots have gone into hiding (Optimus was nearly killed at some point, apparently, and hasn\u2019t been seen since). A CIA agent (Kelsey Grammer, talking very deliberately and never blinking) is making a name for himself by hunting down the Autobots and killing them one by one \u2014 only he\u2019s telling the president that he\u2019s actually killing Decepticons. Perhaps he\u2019s lying because he\u2019s working with a robot bounty hunter named Lockdown, who is never set up or explained in any meaningful way \u2014 but his face does turn into a pretty cool-looking gun.\nMeanwhile, Mark Wahlberg plays Cade Yeager, a single dad trying to keep his home out of foreclosure and provide for his 17-year-old daughter, Tessa (Bates Motel\u2019s Nicola Peltz). Cade is an inventor, mainly because he wears glasses and keeps reminding everyone that he\u2019s an inventor, but he\u2019s forced to make ends meet by repairing junk that he salvages. One day he\u2019s picking up scraps from an abandoned movie theater, where he comes across a broken-down semi truck. What follows is such a mess of random events and happenstance that it\u2019s best described in snippets rather than pretending it builds any sort of meaningful narrative: Cade repairs the truck and finds out that it\u2019s Optimus Prime. They team up with the few remaining Autobots, with Grammer\u2019s CIA hit squad in pursuit. Cade and company discover that a mercurial tech executive (Stanley Tucci, the film\u2019s one consistent highlight) has found a way to build Autobot clones using a rare element called \"transformium.\" Tucci sics his clones on our heroes, because the aforementioned robot bounty hunter wants Optimus Prime so badly that he\u2019s willing to give Tucci a device that will create even more transformium in return.\nAnd yes, it\u2019s really called transformium.\nBay's impeccable visual skills remain intact\nThe story has so many strange shifts and awkward lurches that it\u2019s hard to believe it was ever intended to be a cohesive whole \u2014 and that feeling permeates every aspect of the film from start to finish. Characters mysteriously change location in the space of a cut during action sequences. Wahlberg plays Cade with comic, wide-eyed goofiness in one moment, only to be deadly serious the next. Optimus doles out platitudes (\"Honor to the end!\") at seemingly random intervals. And robots come and go with such little concern for backstory or context that it feels like every scene was constructed simply by throwing a dart at a roster of potential characters. The lack of thematic and tonal consistency turns the film\u2019s two hour and 45 minute running time into a pummeling assault, essentially daring the audience to keep track of what\u2019s happening.\nWhat\u2019s worse is that for the first hour the movie actually does seem like it\u2019s managed to right the ship. Silicon Valley\u2019s T.J. Miller plays a goofy colleague of Cade\u2019s, and their rapport sets the stage for a genuinely engaging push-and-pull that unfortunately goes nowhere. And while Cade\u2019s overprotective feelings towards his daughter aren\u2019t novel, they\u2019re imminently human and relatable. Unfortunately, they\u2019re turned into nothing more than a running gag after Tessa\u2019s boyfriend shows up, as the movie sidelines any human interactions in lieu of robot reactions and a stroboscopic string of explosions.\nWhat Bay still does better than anyone else is produce hyperkinetic imagery that is almost anthemic in its rah-rah Americanism. Waving flags, slow-motion explosions; all of the elements are there, and when they work they\u2019re phenomenal (a slow-motion shot of a car taking out a CIA agent is a particular highlight). Industrial Light & Magic\u2019s effects work is better than ever, though it doesn\u2019t solve the fundamental design problem of the Transformers themselves. They\u2019ve always been a mess of visual noise and interlocking parts, and while they may look more photoreal than ever it\u2019s still nearly impossible to get a read on which character is which if they\u2019re not in the (rare) wide shot.\nIn fact, the most consistently coherent thing about Transformers: Age of Extinction may be its relentless devotion to product placement. From the very beginning, when somebody wonders if the movie theater has an IMAX projector, it\u2019s an onslaught, with Budweiser, Microsoft, Blue Cross, and many, many others all showing up at one moment or another. There even appears to be region-specific product placement. During a stretch in Beijing, several characters hold cups with Chinese-language branding just so to ensure the camera gets the perfect view.\nOf course, it\u2019s very likely that none of the film\u2019s failings will matter. The franchise has never been held in high critical regard, but that hasn\u2019t stopped it from raking in more than $2.6 billion worldwide . With that kind of box-office performance, there\u2019s obviously little incentive to change anything \u2014 and audiences will no doubt flock to this installment as well.\nThe problem is that these movies could be better. There\u2019s an often-made argument that audiences should just shut their brains off and enjoy a mindless summer movie, but amazing visuals and action sequences can coexist with compelling characters and epic storylines. It\u2019s why The Avengers was such a beloved success, and why we\u2019re all hoping J.J. Abrams can tap into some of that old-school Star Wars magic. Christopher Nolan\u2019s career alone is proof that there is a want and a need for films that are both smart and broadly commercial. But as long as audiences continue to flock to movies like Transformers: Age of Extinction and forgive their shortcomings, that\u2019s what Hollywood will make. Not the movies we want, but the movies we deserve.\nTransformers: Age of Extinction is now playing.
