{"Main text":"The Nexus 9 with LTE is finally available for $600\nTwo months later and with a six hundred dollar price tag\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe regular version of HTC's Nexus 9 tablet isn't hard to come by; you can  pick it up at Google Play or even Best Buy. But the LTE-capable model has so far been absent \u2014 until today. T-Mobile has announced an immediate launch of the Nexus 9 with LTE. Priced at $599.76 full retail, the Android 5.0 Lollipop tablet can also be purchased for $0 down and 24 monthly payments of $24.99. It's being sold through T-Mobile's Underground site, a storefront aimed at \"the true enthusiast.\" We've asked the carrier for more details on in-store availability for the Nexus 9. But you don't need to wait for that; online orders are happening now.\nGoogle Play also began selling the  Nexus 9 with LTE later in the day Friday, though you'll pay a few cents extra at $599.99. So T-Mobile is the only option for buying directly through a carrier right now, but Google Play also has stock ready.\nRead our review of the Nexus 9\nThe LTE Nexus 9 includes 32GB of storage. By contrast, you'd pay $479 for the non-cellular version with the same amount of storage. Even that's pretty expensive for what the Nexus 9 offers, and $600 is doubly hard to swallow. But if you've been waiting, it's here. Just don't expect any color choices from T-Mobile, as it looks like the only option customers have for now is black.\n","Title":"The Nexus 9 with LTE is finally available for $600 | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
