{"Main text":"Hacker jailed for revealing George W. Bush\u2019s bizarre bathroom art\nFour years behind bars for email hacking\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA hacker who  revealed George W. Bush\u2019s bizarre experiments with art has been sentenced to four years in jail. Marcel Lazar Lehel, a former cab driver from Romania, was known under the alias \"Guccifer,\" and rose to fame last year after he hacked into the former US President Bush\u2019s AOL email account. Guccifer managed to snag photos, private emails, security codes, and information on George H.W. Bush's declining health, but Bush\u2019s awkward bathroom self-portraits made the headlines.\nThe two unfinished paintings showed Bush in a bathroom with a view of his toes and the other painted from over his shoulder looking into a mirror. Guccifer\u2019s antics may have embarrassed George W. Bush, but the former president decided to  showcase more than two dozen portraits in April, along with artifacts and photos from his presidency.  Guccifer didn\u2019t just target Bush though: a long list of alleged victims include government and military officials, journalists, diplomats, academics, and even Hillary Clinton's email exchanges after the Benghazi attack. Guccifer used a variety of ways to gain access to email accounts, but one popular method allowed him to guess security answers using publicly available information.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
