Whether you were offering directions to the shop or expressing confusion over FDA genomics regulation, Clip Art had the perfect pictorial representation (3D bubble arrows and Silhouette Figure With Question Mark in these two examples).\nNow, however, Microsoft has announced that it\u2019s closing down the service for good , replacing Clip Art with a Bing Image search that\u2019s filtered for results with personal or commercial Creative Commons licenses. It makes sense to save costs and boost Bing usage (although most people will hop over to Google Images regardless) but it\u2019s still a little sad to lose the familiar host of cartoon hieroglyphics that made up the Clip Art catalogue. Leaflets everywhere from doctors\u2019 waiting rooms to school hallways will feel the loss.\nAt least we've still got Word Art.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe universal symbol for confusion: an Ignatz mouse look-alike with clown feet.\nCould be a camcorder, could be a leaked prop from the new Star Wars.\nWell-documented to have appeared in every Microsoft earnings' call from '92 to '96.\nOften overlooked by art historians, Picasso's 'Clip Art period' was short-lived but fruitful.\nMainly Clip Art failed because it couldn't keep up with the pace of coffee innovation.\nPeople think the Mercator projection is a skewed way to map the world, but at least that has the water in the right place.\nWho doesn't keep a spoon with their computer stationery?\nA cassette player or the severed head of an robo-insect supervillain?\n'Hey Jimmy, you know what might actually be a good idea? Helping out with this presentation instead of filling it with Clip Art.'\n","Title":"Clip Art is dead: re-live the glory days of pamphlets and PowerPoint here | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","photo-essay","tech"]}
