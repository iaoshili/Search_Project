{"Main text":"Sri Lanka published a mosquito-repelling newspaper\nPrinted with ink mixed with citronella\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSri Lanka's Mawbima holds the distinction of printing \"the world's first mosquito-repelling newspaper,\"  according to Core77 . With the help of advertising agency Leo Burnett, the publication carried out a multi-step campaign in an attempt to help combat dengue, a mosquito-borne disease. Mawbima began by placing large posters at bus shelters throughout the country. Each of these notices was coated with citronella, a natural insect repellent. Following that, Mawbima published a week-long series of educational articles detailing ways to combat the disease, before finally printing a special edition of the newspaper on World Health Day. The ink used was mixed with citronella in hopes of dissuading the deadly mosquitos from feeding on readers.\nAccording to the World Health Organization , over 2.5 billion people are at risk of contracting dengue, which is also known as \"breakbone fever\" due to its virulent symptoms. The disease has recently become  a problem even in the United States, where it was eradicated nearly 70 years ago.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
