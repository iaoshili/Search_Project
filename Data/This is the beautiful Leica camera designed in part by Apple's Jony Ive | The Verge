It's said that Ive and Newson took 85 days and went through over 500 models to come up with the final product. The result is a striking rangefinder camera that looks like it would be right at home on the set of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Not that the specifications matter, but in case you're wondering the digital camera features the same 24-megapixel, full-frame CMOS sensor as the  $7,000 Leica M , and it comes with a 50mm f\/2 lens.\nIconic German camera manufacturer Leica, of course, is no stranger to  timeless design . Indeed, the style of a Leica rangefinder is almost as appealing as the company's legendary lenses. Apple has certainly been inspired by the cameras over the years; Steve Jobs notably compared the iPhone 4 to one of the rangefinders,  saying on stage in 2010 that \"It's like a beautiful old Leica camera.\"\nThe pair of designers also worked on creating a one-off  Neal Feay Studio aluminum desk for the auction, and the team customized and selected a range of other products. It doesn't appear that any pictures of the desk are available yet. A Steinway & Sons Parlor Grand Piano and a 2012 Range Rover customized by the pair are part of the auction as well, as are solid gold Apple EarPods. Some of the other objects selected by the two designers include a used Russian cosmonaut suit, and a customized Jaeger-LeCoultre Atmos \"561\" Clock. The auction is being held on November 23rd in New York.\n","Title":"This is the beautiful Leica camera designed in part by Apple's Jony Ive | The Verge","Tags":["design"]}
