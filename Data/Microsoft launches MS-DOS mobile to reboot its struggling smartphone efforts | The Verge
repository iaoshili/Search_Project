{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is going back to the basics for a joke at the expense of Windows Phone today. What do you do when your smartphone operating system has less than  three percent market share worldwide? Reboot. While the software giant isn\u2019t quite dramatically rebooting all over again, it has genuinely launched an  MS-DOS mobile app for Windows Phone as part of an April Fools\u2019 Day prank. It\u2019s one of the more elaborate efforts we\u2019ll likely witness on the most irritating and trivial day of the year.\nJust like the real MS-DOS, you navigate around by typing in DIR to list available apps and using the CD command to enter into directories. I must admit, it\u2019s rather fun and nostalgic. If you manage to navigate to the programs folder there\u2019s a camera.exe app that will let you take an ASCII or CGA selfie. There\u2019s even a Rock Paper Scissors game that reminds you of the good old days of Sound Blaster sound cards and CGA, EGA, and VGA display settings with the help of Cortana. It\u2019s all incredibly nerdy, which is probably why I begrudgingly love it. Just type WIN at any point and sit back and marvel at Windows 3.1.\nFun commands:\nCOLOR: alter the MS-DOS appearance with a variety of colors\nDATE: display the date in case you forgot it\u2019s April Fools\u2019 Day\nVER: shows the current MS-DOS version\nFORMAT: use format c: and Cortana will save the day\nWIN: launch Windows 3.1\nA: type A: to try and access a floppy disk\nHELP: discover all the commands\nVerge Video: Project Spartan, Windows' successor to Internet Explorer\n","Title":"Microsoft launches MS-DOS mobile to reboot its struggling smartphone efforts | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tldr","tech"]}
