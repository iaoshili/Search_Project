{"Main text":"To beat the iPhone, you have to beat the iPhone\u2019s camera\nSpeed kills, and the iPhone goes from 0 to a good picture faster than anything else\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI was at Intel\u2019s CES booth, composing a photo with my Android smartphone, when a pair of anonymous hands thrust a shining iPhone 6 Plus into my line of vision. A nonchalant tap of the camera shutter button later, the hands were pulling back, having captured a stupendously clear and sharp picture on the first attempt. By the time I\u2019d completed my routine of setting proper focus and steadying myself, the dude who\u2019d beaten me to a better shot with none of the effort was already walking away. It was enough to make anyone sink into a deep state of gadget envy.\nFor a show overrun with various visions of smart drones and smarter homes for the future, the present of CES was remarkably uniform. I saw more iPhones in the hands of CES attendees than I did Android phones across the countless exhibitor booths. From the biggest keynote event to the smallest stall on the show floor, everything was being documented with Apple\u2019s latest smartphone, and it all looked so irritatingly easy. I don\u2019t want an iPhone, but dammit, I want the effortlessness of the iPhone\u2019s camera.\nI don\u2019t want an iPhone, but dammit, I want the effortlessness of the iPhone\u2019s camera\nThe iPhone\u2019s lead as the smartphone to beat has rarely been defined by just one thing. At one point, the biggest advantage was the simplicity and speed of its interface; at another, it was down to the diversity and quality of available apps; and most recently, the iPhone has distinguished itself with the quality of its 8-megapixel camera. Today, the combination of all these things \u2014 simple and fast operation, strong optics and image processing, and a wide app ecosystem \u2014 is helping people create the best possible images with the least possible hassle.\nThe effortlessness of taking good pictures with the iPhone is probably that phone\u2019s most underrated quality. And yet, its importance grows with every passing day. Consider how vital the camera in any modern smartphone is. Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter are the most popular communication platforms, and they\u2019re all either image-centric or moving toward a greater reliance on visuals. To get the most out of Pinterest, Tumblr, Foursquare check-ins, or Yelp restaurant reviews, you\u2019ll want to be able to take quick and easy mobile pictures. The standard that must be reached isn\u2019t so much about image quality as it is about quickness, predictability, and reliability \u2014 and nobody does those things better than Apple.\nSnapchat, Instagram, Facebook... the apps you use most all need a good camera\nIn all the years of Android\u2019s existence, in spite of huge investments of time and money, there\u2019s never been a standout Android cameraphone. Some have cameras that are better in low light than the iPhone\u2019s, many have higher resolution, and a number claim to be faster at focusing \u2014 but none pull it all together into the same comprehensive package that the iPhone can offer. Samsung and LG give you a pared-down \"just shoot\" experience, but they lack software polish and speed; Motorola\u2019s camera launches and shoots quickly, but the quality is mediocre; and Sony manages to combine an excellent image sensor with terrible autofocus. Microsoft\u2019s PureView cameras fare better, but the Windows Phone camera app is comparatively slow and unintuitive, and there\u2019s a reason why former Lumia chief Ari Partinen is now tagging his photos with #iPhone6Plus instead of #Lumia1520 .\nAs 2015 gets going in earnest and phone makers resume their annual quest to oust the iPhone from its dominant position, I offer this advice: don\u2019t worry about the phone, focus on beating the camera. This is a familiar refrain, as true today as it was three years ago, and it\u2019s frankly embarrassing for the mobile industry to lag so badly for so long on such a fundamental aspect of the modern user experience. The pursuit of gimmicks like UltraPixels and laser autofocus goes some way to explaining this conundrum, but I\u2019d rather we just fix it.\nThe most critical component to Apple\u2019s current mobile dominance lies behind that sapphire crystal lens. In today\u2019s commoditized smartphone market, even great design and spectacular thinness are becoming commonplace. Powerful processors and large batteries are expected rather than exceptional. To win over new customers (and to keep existing ones), smartphone makers will have to act like what they are selling is actually a smart camera first and everything else second.\n","Title":"To beat the iPhone, you have to beat the iPhone\u2019s camera | The Verge","Tags":["apple","photography","mobile","editorial","tech"]}
