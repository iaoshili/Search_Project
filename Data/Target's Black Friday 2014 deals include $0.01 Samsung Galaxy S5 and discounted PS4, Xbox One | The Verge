It's certainly starting early and will have lots of gift card rebates, according to its Black Friday preview ad . Target will offer some pre-sale Black Friday discounts in stores and online starting Wednesday, November 26th, but you need to check  Target's weekly ad here on Sunday, November 23rd to find out what specific details will be offered at your local store. Target stores will open on at 6 PM local time on Thanksgiving Day, Thursday, November 27th, in most places  except Massachusetts . For last-minute shoppers, Target will be open from 7 AM to 9 or 10 PM local time on Christmas Eve, Wednesday, December 24th.\nFrom Sunday, November 23rd, through Saturday, November 29th, Target will offer exclusive discounts through its free shopping app  Cartwheel (Android and iOS). Those deals include 50 percent off a different toy every day, 60 percent off select movie titles, and discounts on bakeware and board games.\nHere are some of the other notable deals to be on the lookout for starting Thanksgiving, Thursday, November 27th:\nTVs\n","Title":"Target's Black Friday 2014 deals include $0.01 Samsung Galaxy S5 and discounted PS4, Xbox One | The Verge","Tags":["tech","black-friday\",\"Story Streams\"","\"6957294"]}
