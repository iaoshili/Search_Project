{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApart from the obvious tourist attractions, New York City is full of smaller experimental art exhibits, and this week the speaker company Sonos has created one in the form of a short exhibit at the NeueHouse workspace in Manhattan's Flatiron district. The company worked with musicians like Blood Orange's Dev Hynes, Best Coast, and Danny Brown as well as art collectives like The Principals, Big Noble, and Perfect Fools to set up a week-long experience full of interactive installations.\nThroughout the residency, which ends on October 5th, Sonos will be hosting bevy of performances and Q&A sessions alongside the installations, and while the RSVP lists for the events are already full, Sonos gave us a look at everything they've set up.\nThe first installation on the main floor of NeueHouse combines a 15-minute piece of music made by Hynes with two rows of motor-driven reflective mylar (created by The Principals) that hang from the ceiling. The mylar reacts directly to the beats of the music, and one section in the back is hooked up to a microphone that lets visitors interact with the piece themselves by making their own noise.\nDownstairs are workstations for building speakers using Sonos components and AutoDesk, along with a microphone and MakerBot printer dedicated to printing a 3D waveform of your voice. Next to that was another impressive multimedia installation, something the Swedish creative agency Perfect Fools and the artists of Big Noble created with Sonos called \"Sounds of New York City.\" Internal LEDs turn a wall of 300 Sonos Play:1 speakers into a display that features animations of people walking or trains moving mapped to corresponding sounds recorded by the collaborators. The most striking mode displays a colorful view of the five boroughs that \u2014 via a Microsoft Kinect \u2014 lets users wave their hands to select spots on the map that trigger songs from hometown artists (Jay-Z's \"Empire State of Mind,\" for example). Each speaker is fastened to a motor that drives it toward or away from whoever is interacting with it, adding three-dimensional life to the rig.\n\"This is what you get when you try something really hard.\"\nBrad Wolf, the Senior Director of Brand Innovation at Sonos, sees events like these as a proving ground for the ideas that his department comes up with. \"We might move it to LA and have a \u2018Sounds of LA\u2019,\" he said of the speaker installation. \"You might see it in retail, you might see it in an event with an artist, but first we\u2019re trying to see how this 1.0 works out.\"  His caution was prescient, as the complicated setup gave the on-site team trouble, and at one point needed to be completely reset. But the problem was a mundane one that most of us can relate to: one mistakenly disconnected plug. Wolf laughed it off. \"This is what you get when you try something really hard.\" As the crews from Big Noble and Perfect Fools worked on restarting their creation, Wolf smiled in the glow of the red error-message light coming from the speakers as he repeated himself. \"It'll come alive. It'll come alive.\"\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe Principals built the installation so that the audio signal from Dev Hynes' music also splits from a Sonos Connect unit into a spectrum analyzer which splits the sound into five different frequencies. Each frequency is mapped to a different motor above a particular section of mylar, creating a pulsing effect that reacts to the different parts of the song.\nSonos Play:1's were also stationed underneath the installation and played Hynes' 15-minute composition on a loop.\nThe custom rig built by The Principals worked alongside Sonos Connect units to power the installation.\nThe quilt-like installation hangs above this workspace on the main floor of NeueHouse, and at the top of the stairs an ambient microphone lets visitors interact with their own section of the mylar. During the week, Hynes will actually perform his composition live an let the installation react to the performance.\nThe installation is made out of silver-coated mylar, a surface that is so reflective that the members of The Principals who built it had to use gloves so they could keep it all from smudging. \"It almost isn't there, it picks up everything around it, and it's so pliable that it's fluid like water,\" Drew Seskunas of The Principals told me.\nDownstairs at NeueHouse is where the more hands-on features are found, like the station where you can build your own speaker from Sonos components.\nFrom hot glue to wiring, the build-your-own speaker station is stocked with all the tools needed for assembly, along with experts who help you learn how to do it yourself.\nVisitors are able to record a short phrase into this microphone and the waveform of the audio gets 3D-printed in the adjacent MakerBot printer.\nShown here is one of many waveforms printed throughout the day. The phrases had to be short, so many people went with options like their own name, or quotes like \"Don't worry, be happy.\"\nThe workers on hand could also print out waveforms as decoration for the build-your-own-speaker section.\nThe Kinect unit that sat atop the \"Sounds of New York City\" installation tracks hand movement, and lets users select songs by waving a hand in front of specifically colored speakers.\nThe entire basement level was split into sections. \"Make\" for the hands-on stations, \"Play\" for where the speaker wall was set up, and \"Listen\" for the space where performances will be held all week.\nThe retail versions of Sonos Play:1 speakers don't light up, but Sonos Brand Innovation Director Brad Wolf didn't rule out the possibility of it happening in the future. \u201CWe\u2019re looking at that type of thing, how much we vary our speaker designs. If people really respond to this really well, I think it could have a place.\u201D\n","Title":"The stunning sights and sounds of the Sonos art exhibit | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","design"]}
