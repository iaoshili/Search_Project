{"Main text":"One of the most beautiful games ever gets the posters it deserves\nNow you can hang 'Okami' on your wall\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith its painterly style, Okami is easily one of the most beautiful experiences in gaming, and now you can hang it on your walls. Publisher Capcom has partnered with Dutch art dealership Cook & Becker to release a series of limited edition, \"museum-grade\" art prints for the game, which was originally released on the PlayStation 2 back in 2006.\nThe new hand-numbered prints feature a variety of art and designs from Takeyasu Sawaki, Kenichiro Yoshimura, and Mari Shimazaki who all worked on the game at Japanese studio Clover. The art dealer is no stranger to video games, having previously partnered with the likes of Sony and Irrational Games to release prints from games like The Last of Us and Bioshock Infinite, but Okami's vibrant style is particularly well suited to being framed and hung up in your office. The new Okami pieces range in price from $75 to $130, and you can pick them up here while they last.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
