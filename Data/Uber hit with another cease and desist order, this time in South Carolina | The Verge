{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber's been hit with another cease and desist order from an upset local government, this time in South Carolina. The Public Service Commission of South Carolina today ordered the transportation company (which also delivers kittens , ice cream , and human food ), to halt its operations there due to what it says is improper licensing of its drivers. The legal notice names Rasier LLC, which is a subsidiary of Uber and operates its UberX service, saying that the company's drivers simply don't have the right credentials to be picking people up and taking them places for money.\n\"All motor carriers transporting persons or property for compensation to first obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity before commencing operation,\" the filing states, later adding that the idea itself is not entirely terrible. \"Consumers benefit from, and deserve choices in, the marketplace. However, those choices must be consistent with state law intended to protect the public.\"\nUber's been in South Carolina for nearly seven months\nUber has been operating its UberX service in the state since July of last year . Local regulators have been contemplating a special new classification for Uber and other services like it. A hearing to discuss the matter was originally set for later this month, but was halted after Uber surprised officials by filing to have its service certified to operate like other taxi and limousine services.\n\"Despite working closely with the PSC for the past several months on a permanent solution for Uber in South Carolina, today\u2019s actions are unexpected and not reflective of the progress made thus far,\" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have challenged the order and remain committed to providing South Carolinians with greater opportunity and choice.\"\nUber recently faced similar problems in Portland, Oregon where it launched without the approval of the local government. Officials there returned the favor, in kind, threatening a lawsuit along with steep fines for both the company and its drivers. Uber ultimately agreed to hit pause on its business after the city said it planned to overhaul its local transit laws over the next three months.\nUpdate January 15th, 9:44PM ET: with comment from Uber.\n","Title":"Uber hit with another cease and desist order, this time in South Carolina | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","transportation"]}
