Microsoft is currently building Cortana into Windows 10, which is set to debut later this year, and it\u2019s likely that the digital assistant will make its way on to Android and iOS alongside its PC expansion.\nMicrosoft is working on a new version of Cortana for later this year\nIn an interview with Reuters, Microsoft\u2019s Eric Horvitz, managing director of Microsoft Research, reveals that the company is planning a bigger roll out of Cortana later this year. \"This kind of technology, which can read and understand email, will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana, which we are working on now for the fall time frame,\" says Horvitz. Microsoft is currently developing a more advanced version of Cortana, codenamed project Einstein, that pulls data from artificial intelligence. While there\u2019s not many details on Einstein from Reuters\u2019 report, it appears to be an effort to improve the awareness of Cortana and its ability to automate even more tasks.\nMicrosoft\u2019s move to bring Cortana to iOS and Android won\u2019t surprise many. The software maker has consistently shown that it\u2019s willing to bring its best Windows features to rival platforms in an overall effort to improve its services and apps. While Cortana is a standout feature for Windows Phone, and soon Windows 10, the small amount of consumers using it won\u2019t help Microsoft\u2019s goal of improving its digital assistant with machine learning techniques and bringing its services and apps to all smartphone and tablet owners. It\u2019s a natural part of Microsoft\u2019s continued transformation to return to its software roots with its apps and services running on every device.\nVerge Videos archive: A first-hand look at Cortana on Windows Phone (2014)\n","Title":"Microsoft's Cortana is coming to iOS and Android | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
