{"Main text":"He's not a Microsoft designer but Windows 10 was his idea\nFrom concept to reality\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike many Windows 8 users, self-taught user-experience designer Jay Machalani was frustrated by the inconsistencies of Microsoft\u2019s touch-friendly operating system. Instead of moaning online or ignoring his frustrations, Machalani set out to prove things could change for the next major release of Windows  in a series of concepts . Machalani doesn't work for Microsoft, but his ideas caught their attention. As I sat and listened to Windows chief Terry Myerson introduce Windows 10 at Microsoft\u2019s special press event last week, I was immediately reminded of Machalani\u2019s concepts. From a modern Start menu to windowed apps, Microsoft demonstrated many of the exact same features that Machalani called for almost a year ago.  If Windows 7 was everyone\u2019s idea , Windows 10 appears to be his.\nMachalani\u2019s concepts centered around a method of easing the jarring switching between desktop and \"Metro.\" He even produced a prototype of a way to switch between the \"Metro\" part of Windows 8 and a traditional Start menu on a hybrid device like the Surface. Microsoft created its own  concept in the form of Continuum , a way for hybrid devices to use both touch and keyboard \/ mouse features. They\u2019re both very similar, aiming to improve the experience of mouse and keyboard on hybrid machines with touch \/ tablet modes.\nIt\u2019s easy to explain the similarities as obvious design choices, but the resemblance is really apparent with the Start menu. Machalani\u2019s concept is eerily similar to the real thing, and Microsoft even has an adaptive menu in Windows 10 that scrolls horizontally when it\u2019s full of pinned apps. Machalani created this concept, and also called for Microsoft to revolutionize its old iconography, which the company appears to be doing in Windows 10.\nMachalani's concepts are eerily similar to Windows 10\nIt\u2019s impossible to say whether Microsoft was influenced by Machalani\u2019s concepts directly, but the software maker definitely saw them and invited him to campus to discuss his ideas for Windows earlier this year. \"It was great to meet Jay and hear his design thinking,\" says Albert Shum, general manager of design and content at Microsoft in a statement to The Verge. \"We always love engaging with smart, passionate people who look at the world and see new possibilities.\"\nMachalani welcomes Microsoft\u2019s approach . \"It\u2019s great! If I managed to influence the Windows design in any way to a good direction, that\u2019s enough.\"\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"He's not a Microsoft designer but Windows 10 was his idea | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","report","concepts","design","tech"]}
