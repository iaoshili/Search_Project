{"Main text":"Tesla's new entry-level sedan is the faster, all-wheel drive Model S 70D\nThe 70D is $5,000 pricier than its predecessor but has a better range\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTesla just raised the standard for its base-level sedan, scrapping the rear-wheel drive Model S 60 for the new, all-wheel drive Model S 70D. With prices starting at around $75,000, the 70D is $5,000 more expensive than the 60, but adds a second motor at the front of the vehicle and a bigger, 70 kWh battery pack that bumps up the car's range to an EPA-rated 240 miles.\n0-60 in 5.2 seconds and supercharging as standard\nThe 70D is also more powerful than its predecessor, offering a combined 514 horsepower, a top speed of 140mph, and a 0-60 time of 5.2 seconds. In addition to this speed bump (no, not that kind), the 70D comes with access to Tesla's Supercharging network as standard \u2014 something that was previously an expensive extra for the Model S 60. Keyless entry and Tesla's Autopilot hardware are also included (although the latter will  still need a software update before it's enabled), and customers have the choice of three metallic colors: ocean blue, obsidian black, and warm silver.\nTesla chief Elon Musk says the Model S 70D represents a \"slight price increase, but [a] huge value increase.\" According to a  report from Reuters , Musk said that fewer than 10 percent of Tesla's sales were of the rear-wheel drive Model S 60, and although the company was retaining the single-motor Model S 85, it was happy to make the switch to dual motors for its entry-level sedan. \"Customers wanted something that had more range and they really wanted all-wheel drive,\" said Musk. The Model S 70D  goes on sale today and will begin shipping to customers in late May.\nVerge Video: Riding in the insane Tesla P85D\n","Title":"Tesla's new entry-level sedan is the faster, all-wheel drive Model S 70D | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
