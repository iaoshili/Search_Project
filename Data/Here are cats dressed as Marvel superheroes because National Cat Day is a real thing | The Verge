{"Main text":"Here are cats dressed as Marvel superheroes because National Cat Day is a real thing\nMore like Catman, right? Anyone? Hello? Is this thing on?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTo celebrate National Cat Day, a thing I did not know existed until I began this post, Marvel published a few illustrations of cats dressed as its popular superheroes. The images are available on the company's Facebook page. The Thor illustration, shown above, and the Spider-Man art, post below, stand out because they most capture that je ne sais quois of a cat's inner catness.\nBe sure to see the other images on theÂ  Marvel Facebook page , and celebrate National Cat Day with my favorite Birthday Cat video, pasted onto the bottom of this page.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
