VAlcatel's Pixi phones can't actually triple-boot into different operating systems\u000aBut a super-cheap phone with LTE is still worth paying attention to\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAlcatel Onetouch announced the third generation of its Pixi line of smartphones a few days ago and offered up the intriguing possibility of a phone that could  run three different operating systems . Now we've gotten a chance to check out the new Pixi family and unfortunately got some bad news \u2014 users won't be able to boot between Android, Firefox OS, and Windows Phone. Alcatel told us that the multi-OS mode is more of an offering for carrier partners to fill out their lineups with phones running their preferred OS rather than something a buyer will be able to play around with.\u000aThat unfortunate omission means there isn't a whole for the Pixi family to hang their hat on, at least for those of us used to huge and powerful smartphones. Alcatel described these phones as their most entry-level devices, and it shows \u2014 they're thick, not very pleasant to hold, and have no discernible standout hardware features. The 3.5-inch model has the same screen resolution of the iPhone 3GS, which was released back in 2009, the 4-inch model comes in at 800 x 480, and the 4.5- and 5-inch models feature 854 x 400 screens. That's a far cry from the 720p and 1080p screens that've become commonplace, and the relatively low resolution isn't the only problem with these displays. They're just not that pleasant to look at.\u000aAlcatel is competing with the Moto E, not the Moto X\u000aOf course, these phones aren't meant to compare with the Nexus 6 or Moto X \u2014 they're meant to be incredibly low-cost devices that help bring connected smartphones to more and more people. To that end, it's worth noting that three of the four Pixi models will run on LTE networks, a pretty big inclusion for an inexpensive phone. Indeed, while the  cheap but surprisingly good Moto E feels like a much higher-quality device overall, it doesn't include LTE support. And while these phones aren't much to look at, they were pretty responsive in the quick amount of time we had to play with them.\u000aI'd probably still recommend a Moto E over the Pixi series, but these could still be viable options for anyone looking for a dirt-cheap, unlocked smartphone with LTE on board. While we're disappointed not to have a cheap phone that can triple-boot into different smartphone operating systems, an inexpensive and reasonably capable LTE phone could still be a meaningful product to a huge market of potential customers.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000a"Why do you like watching someone else play a video game?"\u000aMy fiancée, among other people, has asked me this multiple times throughout our relationship. She doesn't get it. Most people don't get it. But it's simple, really: skill.\u000aI pride myself in my own video game skills \u2014 my first-person shooter skills, specifically. I'm better than my friends and my co-workers. I do well online, but I'm not the best, and that aggravates me. There was a time though when I wanted to be the best.\u000aThen I found e-sports.\u000aProfessional gamers are superhuman, just like LeBron James and Sidney Crosby are superhuman \u2014 consistently capable of performing feats that seem impossible. There's one main difference with e-sports, though: most viewers understand what's happening in basketball and hockey. Even just visually, video games can be dauntingly complicated.\u000aProfessional gamers are superhuman\u000aA work-in-progress cut of  All Work All Play , a documentary that focuses on the rise of e-sports and some of the best competitive teams in the world, just premiered at the TriBeCa Film Festival. All Work All Play profiles a few professional League of Legends teams as well as the programming director of the Electronic Sports League, Michal "Carmac" Blicharz. The film attempts to bring the viewer into the world of competitive gaming while constantly making comparisons to other professional sports by highlighting team changes, grandiose spectacles, intense crowds, and broadcasters.\u000aThe story of Carmac and his rise in the e-sports community is fascinating: learning about his rise from small LAN gatherings, where he and his friends would hustle other competitors to make a living; to seeing him with his adorable family as he plans for the future of spectator gaming, which was by far my favorite storyline in the film. Carmac's story is interwoven with the journey of select teams competing at ESL's largest and most prestigious tournament, Intel Extreme Masters.\u000aAll Work All Play tried harder, and succeeded better, than any other attempt I've seen to make e-sports relatable and coherent \u2014 but it's still extremely confusing. I've played League of Legends (albeit very briefly) and have a general understanding of how the game works. I'll watch tournaments if they're on when I'm browsing Twitch because I like the intensity and the stakes. It's a rush even if the skill isn't super apparent to me because I know these players are the best in the world. Early on, an attempt is made to explain what League of Legends is and what competitors need to do in order to win. I followed along, but it went by so quickly that I can't imagine someone without any prior knowledge fully grasping the game's mechanics, and it reminded me why e-sports will always be a niche spectacle.\u000aThe basics of League of Legends are simple enough, but the difference between an average player and a world-class one is in the details: attacks, defense, abilities, upgrades, gold, strategy, teamwork, and so on. Mastering all of these mechanics and then executing them is what separates high-level players from everyone else. They're consistently able to recognize what tactics and abilities to use in any given situation at any given time. The time and dedication necessary to achieve that mastery is almost unfathomable, and even then, some top-level players are still better than others. But unless you've studied the game, you won't know why they're better, like you would when seeing LeBron dunk over three people. It's right here that e-sports become inaccessible to the masses, and All Work All Play doesn't change that.\u000aThe being said, the film tries, and in some instances succeeds, to establish familiarity. The intensity of the matches will seem familiar to anyone who has watched any other professional sport, thanks to some really solid editing work. A typical League of Legends game can last over 30 minutes, but best-of-five game series were run through in a few minutes, which made these sequences extremely watchable.\u000aIn order to truly understand e-sports, you need to understand the people, not the games\u000aBut in order to truly appreciate e-sports, you need to understand the people playing, not the games they're playing, which is All Work All Play's greatest shortcoming. It focuses on entire teams, but not the individuals within them, and that's an important difference. I gained new respect for game developers after watching Indie Game: The Movie because the filmmakers showed me lives instead of products. People are relatable. Niche games are not, unless you're already in that niche.\u000aWhile e-sports will continue to rise in popularity, it will always be growing a niche segment \u2014 the mass-market appeal still isn't there. Plus, in order to survive, e-sports has to adapt as the games and communities evolve over time. Basketball hasn't changed much in the last hundred years, but competitive video games change all the time. There was Quake and Starcraft, Halo and Call of Duty; and now, LoL and Starcraft 2. Attention spans fade, people lose interest, and you're only left with memories of a game you used to like that no one plays anymore. I'll always watch because I appreciate the talent, but I expect most people don't recognize it and haven't had a compelling reason to care. Documentaries like All Work All Play, no matter how interesting or well edited, won't change that any time soon.\u000aVerge Video archive: Dota 2's $10 million tournament takes over an arena (2014)\u000a

VA close look at the Gear VR for the Galaxy S6\u000aVirtual reality is now an accessory, not a niche technology\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aEarlier this week, we saw some big news in the world of virtual reality when HTC announced the Vive, a new VR headset made in partnership with legacy video game company Valve. But the most important news for the adoption of virtual reality came from Samsung, Oculus, and Facebook: there's a new version of the Gear VR that can be powered by both the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the S6 Edge.\u000aVirtual reality is quite obviously still in a nascent state. Even the best headsets still face myriad problems like poor resolution, bulky headsets, and social stigma. "What we want to do is we want to get down to sunglasses," says Max Cohen, head of Oculus Mobile.\u000a"What we want to do is we want to get down to sunglasses."\u000aBut that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. Cohen couldn\u2019t comment on a time frame, but admits how far Oculus has to go before VR glasses are a reality. "Every aspect of this technology, both on Gear VR and the Rift, still needs to improve to get it where we want it," he says. "We're not going to declare victory any time soon." Until then, headsets that use phone drop-ins might be the best consumer solution available.\u000aThe original Gear VR, which works with the Galaxy Note 4, took a step towards solving some of VR\u2019s problems, but left much to be desired. The resolution was good enough, but not great. It was wireless and light, but got uncomfortable after extended use. And it did little to change the fact that people inevitably view you differently once you have a VR headset on your face, and you\u2019re unavoidably cut off from the world. Perhaps most important, not many people owned the Galaxy Note 4, whereas the new version will work on a mainstream phone.\u000aThe first two issues are alleviated in the newest version of the Gear VR. At first blush, the new version is not much different than the Gear VR that uses the Galaxy Note 4. But once you put it on the differences are profound. To start with, the whole unit is much lighter, thanks in part to the fact that the Galaxy S6 weighs less than the Note 4. The straps are more comfortable but still fit tightly, and there's a vent on the left side of the headset that helps reduce lens fogging. Overall, Samsung has really gotten the headset to feel, well, less like a headset.\u000aThe new Gear VR feels less like a headset\u000aThe other big focus for Samsung and Oculus is increasing the screen resolution, which is another place Cohen is ready to admit that the company \u2014 and virtual reality as a medium \u2014 still has a long way to go.\u000a"The reality is we need to go a lot further. We need 4K screens, potentially even 8K screens. So there's still some time before we feel like we've hit the point where that "screen door effect," as we call the impression of a pixelated display, goes away entirely. But the 1440p looks pretty darn good."\u000aHe\u2019s right. The Galaxy S6\u2019s 5.1-inch screen is smaller than the 5.7-inch one found on the Note 4, but that means the pixel density is noticeably higher \u2014 577 ppi compared to 515. That might not sound like a lot, but it made a big difference when I got to try it here at MWC. Everything I queued up \u2014 games, a new Cirque du Soleil demo, a 360-degree 3D photos app made by Otoy \u2014 was more impressive than anything found on the Note 4 version of the Gear VR.\u000aBut the difference from the old version to the new was most stark in the videos featured in the Oculus Cinema section. On the Note 4 version of the Gear VR, this was by far my least favorite content \u2014 it's where the weaknesses of the resolution and lower pixel density were most apparent. My eyes would strain after just 10 or 15 seconds of watching a video, and the experience was worse with 3D content. But on the Galaxy S6 version, all the videos I previewed were not only watchable, they were enjoyable. That screen door effect was majorly mitigated here, and in its place was a much smoother and visually comfortable experience.\u000aIt's hard to understate how important this could be for the success of the Gear VR, and Oculus' efforts in the mobile space in general. The biggest barrier to the Gear VR so far hasn't been the social awkwardness of wearing a head-mounted display, it's that it only worked with a niche device. The idea of a $199 consumer VR device was attractive to many, but shelling out nearly $1,000 more to get a Note 4 off-contract kept the reality of it out of reach.\u000aThe new headset will likely be priced the same, though Samsung will ultimately set the price when it releases it to market \u2014 it\u2019s not yet clear when that will happen. Cohen told us before that he thinks the ideal price is free. Alongside the new headset the company also announced that paid content is making its way to the Gear VR (it should be available in the Oculus store now, and to Note 4 users as well).\u000aImagine the hype if it were compatible with an iPhone\u000aThe Gear VR is about to face its sink-or-swim moment. Instead of being a cool idea burdened by the requirement of owning a niche device, it's now going to be an affordable accessory to a phone that millions of people will own. If you still don't think that's a big deal, you probably haven\u2019t tried it. And imagine the hype if it were compatible with an iPhone.\u000aBy leveraging the new revenue source with paid content and spreading the user base by building a headset around a flagship phone, the idea of dropping the price of the Gear VR to zero doesn\u2019t seem so crazy anymore.\u000aUntil then, people are going to have to understand a few simple facts: virtual reality still needs headsets, and headsets are inherently awkward. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the experience isn\u2019t outrageously cool.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VA Q&A with Dennis McCarthy, the man behind Furious 7's insane cast of cars\u000aDaddy went to work\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIn an industry flush with fancy cars, stunts, and fancy cars doing stunts, calling Dennis McCarthy "Hollywood's car guy" probably wouldn't be an overstatement.\u000aMcCarthy has served as car coordinator for five movies in the ever-growing Fast & Furious franchise, including Furious 7, which hits theaters next week. But F&F is far from his only credit: he's handled the rides for Taken 3, Man of Steel, Green Hornet, the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and many others. Considering that Furious 7 drops cars out of an aircraft and jumps a $3-plus million hypercar between two skyscrapers in Abu Dhabi, I thought it might be worth my time to investigate how this particular flavor of next-level ridiculousness comes together. I chatted with him briefly on the phone this week to get the dirt.\u000aChris Ziegler: What was the breakdown between practical effects and CGI in this film? In your estimation, is it up or down from previous movies in the series?\u000aDennis McCarthy: You know, I really feel that in Furious 7 there\u2019s less CGI. [You think] "My God, that\u2019s impossible," but the amazing thing is that a lot of it actually is possible, you know, in real life. So I would say that there\u2019s less CGI in Furious 7 than the previous ones.\u000aHow do you decide when to shoot something and when to render it? What does that conversation look like?\u000aThat\u2019s really a decision that\u2019s not mine to make, but I can just tell you what is behind the filmmakers on it. Basically, with these movies, you want to do as much as you can for real, because I think that makes a difference. It can look the same \u2014 sometimes it can\u2019t, sometimes it can \u2014 but even if it did look the same on the screen, I think what makes the movie a better film is doing the gag for real.\u000aI got a bunch of phone calls when the trailer came out. Everyone was calling me, "Hey man, did they really drive cars out of planes?" But the answer was yes! And people were just shocked to believe that. But that sequence happened over the Arizona desert with a C-130 and five cars \u2014 actually we had doubles of each, so we had 10 cars, and I think each car made either two or three drops out of that plane. You know, you see the trailer, you watch the Lykan HyperSport go from building to building\u2026 yeah, obviously we couldn\u2019t launch a car out of a building in Abu Dhabi, but the sets were as close to real as possible, the car was real, the jumps were real, the breaking glass was real, the stunt personnel scattering out of the way as the car slides through \u2014 you know, through the floor, all the real deal. So I think that it\u2019s important fans realize there\u2019s a lot more reality to these movies than one might expect.\u000a"We actually can\u2019t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air."\u000aWere there any requests that came in that you just absolutely could not handle as a practical effect? Did James [Wan] or anyone else on staff say, "Can we do this?" and you just said no, that\u2019s not possible?\u000aNo. I mean, there\u2019s always a couple incidents that are just not possible. But the question never really comes to me, because I think as that stuff is being developed, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious, "Okay, that\u2019s something that we actually can\u2019t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air." So, no, for the most part, if we can do real, we will, and like I said, it\u2019s always my goal to keep as much reality in the film as possible, because as a guy that loves car movies myself, that\u2019s what I look for.\u000aIf you\u2019re trying to do as much of this stuff in reality instead of in CGI as possible, you\u2019re probably damaging and destroying some pretty expensive cars. What\u2019s the most expensive car that you\u2019ve had to destroy on set?\u000aWell, I would say in this film, probably the most expensive car to build would\u2019ve been the off-road Charger that you see Dom back out of that airplane. As far as on-screen, visually, it\u2019d be the Lykan HyperSport. Though the cars that we had in the film weren\u2019t the actual production model Lykan HyperSport, they\u2019re basically a movie version that W Motors created for us or built for us. Still very pricey, but not $3.4 million like the actual car would cost.\u000aSo that\u2019s a different chassis and then a body on top that\u2019s designed to look like the real car, I would assume?\u000aThat\u2019s absolutely correct. What W Motors did is they used the exact same molds they use for their actual production car, but they built the car out of fiberglass as opposed to carbon fiber. The chassis, instead of being basically a Porsche race car, is a Porsche Boxster with the wheelbase stretched on it. So yeah, we basically built a car that looks 100 percent correct, or is as close to it as we possibly can, and doesn\u2019t wipe my budget out with just one vehicle.\u000aDo you ever run into any brand licensing issues with cars? Say if you destroy a particular car on set, has an automaker come to you and said, hey, we\u2019d rather you not do that?\u000aNo, not at all. That\u2019s something that\u2019s really taken care of from a whole different department. There is a licensing clearance department, and when these choices come up, there is someone that deals with that. But luckily, it\u2019s not me.\u000aWho\u2019s the best driver in the cast? And for that matter, how much driving does the cast actually get to do?\u000aThe cast does quite a bit of driving, but it\u2019s not the extreme stuff. They\u2019re not jumping the cars, they\u2019re not power-sliding the cars \u2014 they\u2019re doing all the drive-up stuff. The reason being isn\u2019t due to lack of skill, it\u2019s lack of time. So we have to have two units going at all times \u2014 so if there\u2019s a sequence where you\u2019re not going to see the driver of the car, there\u2019s no reason to waste Vin Diesel\u2019s or Michelle\u2019s time behind the wheel of that car. They can be somewhere else, maybe even in a different country filming a different part of the film.\u000aReally, the only cast members that I\u2019ve seen really push the limits would\u2019ve been Paul [Walker] and Vin Diesel. Vin Diesel can slide a car and put it on its mark every time without a problem. I know that they would all prefer to do more driving, but like I said, it would double our production time.\u000aSo this is not your first Fast & Furious film, right?\u000aThis is my fifth one. Three, Four, Five, Six, and now Seven.\u000aWhich has been your favorite to shoot?\u000aYou know, I would have to say Furious 7. They\u2019re getting better every time. Every movie we do, we try to raise that bar and increase the action and increase the number of cars and, you know, this one really jumped it up a couple of levels.\u000aHow did you get into this? What\u2019s your background?\u000aMy background is just building cars. I\u2019ve been into cars since an early age. I think when I was 16 years old, I worked at a speed shop. When I was in my early 20s, I opened my own business building cars. And like I said, it was just one of those things, built a couple different cars for a couple different films, and that led to what I\u2019m doing now.\u000aWould you say this is the most interesting car-focused movie franchise in history?\u000aAbsolutely. There\u2019s really nothing else that comes close to it. To have done seven movies, and they\u2019re all \u2014 every one is more successful than the last \u2014 just says a lot about what Fast & Furious is about.\u000a"It\u2019s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban."\u000aAs a car person, what\u2019s your personal daily driver? What do you take to and from the film sets?\u000aYou know, I have a lot of vehicles, and this is almost\u2026 it\u2019s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban. One, I have four kids, so it comes in handy, and two, I\u2019m always driving a bunch of my guys back and forth on set. So it\u2019s a very practical vehicle, but I do have a lot of other things that I drive when I\u2019m just out having a good time.\u000aDo you think that we\u2019re at the point where we can start [putting hybrid and electric vehicles in the franchise]?\u000aI think we are. I mean, it came close on this one. Prior to the Lykan HyperSport, I wanted the LaFerrari which is a hybrid car, and I was just unable to get it. That was my first choice prior to knowing about the Lykan HyperSport. Once I got that background, script-wise, it actually is a much better fit. But no, I think that\u2019s coming. Like you stated, these cars have made leaps and bounds in the last five years and the performance is amazing. So you know, we\u2019ll see. If Fast 8 happens and I get a script and there\u2019s a spot for it, I\u2019m going to try to get that in there.\u000aVerge Video: Waiting for Furious 7\u000a
