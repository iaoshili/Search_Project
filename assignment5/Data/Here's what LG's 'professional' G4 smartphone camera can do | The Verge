{"Main text":"Here's what LG's 'professional' G4 smartphone camera can do\nFirst sample images show up in LG's latest video teaser for the G4\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApril 28th is the biggest day of the year for LG's mobile unit, marking the launch of the Korean company's flagship smartphone for 2015,  the G4 . In the buildup to the event, LG has dished out most of the phone's core specs and capabilities, and today it's also showing off the first sample images shot with its  16-megapixel camera . They're embedded within a new promo video talking up the wide f\/1.8 lens and professional-grade manual controls that will be featured in the G4.\n\"Even a small difference of a f\/0.1 aperture becomes incredibly important\" when capturing crucial moments, tells us Colby Brown, full-time photographer and now part-time LG spokesperson. He's the guide touring us through the benefits of LG's new cameraphone, among which the most intriguing one might be a claim to having superior color accuracy. A number of sample images shot with the G4 show off its potential, and they look predictably lustrous and splendid. The big emphasis throughout is on the appeal to professional users; they're not the typical smartphone photography demographic, but whatever's good for them will surely be beneficial to more casual users as well. Check out the full promo video, along with early pictures of the LG G4 itself, below.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
