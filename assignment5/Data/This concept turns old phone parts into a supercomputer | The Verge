{"Main text":"This concept turns old phone parts into a supercomputer\nGiving modular smartphones a new lease on life\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne of the selling points for modular smartphones like Project Ara or the Puzzlephone is that they reduce waste. But little has been said about how discarded modules could be put to use. Finland's Circular Devices, the company developing the Puzzlephone, has now revealed its answer to that question: it's called the Puzzlecluster, and it's a scalable supercomputer.\nReuse and reduce\nThe concept is pretty simple: when a Puzzlephone owner inevitably decides to upgrade their modular phone's \"brain\" (read: processor unit), the old module can be repurposed to power a versatile computer. With many different outdated smartphone CPUs combined, the cluster should have enough processing power to make the Puzzlecluster a useful addition to someone's business \u2014 and give the modules a new lease on life.\nIn addition to a traditional power supply, the concept calls for the case to be able to accept battery modules from the Puzzlephone as well, to maintain the system's heartbeat. Circular Devices says that the Puzzlecluster's \"applications can range from research and data analysis, to rendering farms and in-house cloud services, as well as any other case that requires parallel computing.\" The initial illustrations show a small cube that can only accept a few modules at once, but multiple units could be combined together to create an even more powerful computer.\nFor now, the Puzzlecluster is just a concept \u2014 it seems to be little more than a few ideas on a whiteboard. But it's a good idea, and whether or not the Puzzlephone takes off, it's good to see that someone is thinking about what we can do with smartphone modules once they become outdated.\n","Title":"This concept turns old phone parts into a supercomputer | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","concepts","design","tech"]}
