{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPlugging in a USB drive could be one of the most dangerous things you do on your computer, according to new research reported by Wired's Andy Greenberg . A new species of malware, dubbed \"BadUSB,\" can use the drives to take over computers completely, altering files or redirecting web traffic, and because the virus resides in the drive's firmware, it may be impossible to protect against without changing the way the drives work. \"These problems can\u2019t be patched,\" one researcher told Greenberg. \"We\u2019re exploiting the very way that USB is designed.\"\nIt's still unclear exactly how USB drive manufactuers will respond to the news, but the more immediate answer may simply be a more careful approach to how we use the drives. As Greenberg puts it, \"all you have to do is not connect your USB device to computers you don\u2019t own or don\u2019t have good reason to trust \u2014 and don\u2019t plug untrusted USB devices into your own computer.\" That's bad news for lots of projects \u2014 including live-boot systems like Tails , which typically reside on USB drives \u2014 but it would keep users safe from scary attacks from all corners, including possibly the NSA. As researcher Matt Blaze points out, the Snowden documents revealed a number of USB-based attacks used by the NSA, which may rely on the same vulnerability.\n","Title":"USB drives are a security nightmare | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
