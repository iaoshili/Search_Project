We've beenÂ  covering the deals for weeks now , but if you want to cut through the mess and just score the best deals you can find, you've come to the right place.\nAs to be expected, this year there are lots of deals to be had on TVs small and large, 1080p to 4K. You can also get a great price on last year's iPads, which are still better tablets than pretty much anything save for this year's iPads. If you're in the market for a smartwatch or fitness tracker, you can save some money on some really great options this weekend. And if you want to pick up a laptop or new headphones, there are deals to be found too.\nKeep in mind that the best deals won't last long and many of them are limited to Friday itself (or in rare occasions, Thursday too). To win the Black Friday game, you have to be aggressive and quick, there's no time to sleep when deals are to be had. That said, here are the 20 best Black Friday deals this year. Warm up your credit cards and get a good night's sleep, it's time to make the consumer machine work.\nTVs\n","Title":"The 20 best Black Friday deals | The Verge","Tags":["tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"6957294"]}
