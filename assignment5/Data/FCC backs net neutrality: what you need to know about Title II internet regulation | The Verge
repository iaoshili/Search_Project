But here's a pretty big question, what is net neutrality?\nThe answer isn't always so clear, and depending on where you read about today's news first, your interpretation of the phrase might vary a bit.

So...\nYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re for broadband, and then turn around and endorse limits.\nUpdate\nHillary Clinton lends support to the FCC's net neutrality plan days before vote\nBy Nathan Ingraham on February  24, 2015 07:36 pm\nFormer Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Clinton today came out in support of  the FCC's proposal to reclassify broadband as a utility \u2014 the cornerstone of its plan to put stronger net neutrality rules into effect.  In a conversation today with Kara Swisher from Recode , Clinton said she agreed with classifying internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act but also pointed out that there was more that could be done.\n\"I think that for the FCC...\nIt's a foot in the door ... but it's not the end of the discussion.\nUpdate\nConservative FCC commissioners ask Wheeler to delay net neutrality vote\nBy Adi Robertson on February  23, 2015 01:43 pm\nDays before the FCC's net neutrality vote, commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly are making a last-ditch effort to delay it. Today, the pair asked for chair Tom Wheeler to release his full proposal \u2014 currently available only to FCC staff \u2014 and wait at least 30 days for public comments to come in.

In an interview  with The Wall Street Journal , company COO Mike Sievert said that FCC chair Tom Wheeler's plan to reclassify broadband under stricter Title II regulation wouldn't pose a significant threat. \"There is nothing in there that gives us deep concern about our ability to continue executing our strategy,\" said Sievert, though the Journal also said he believed reclassification was not \"the most desirable approach.\"\nThis...\nBut still doesn't support it\nUpdate\nFCC commissioner Ajit Pai weighs in on net neutrality plan: 'worse than I had imagined'\nBy Adi Robertson on February  10, 2015 12:30 pm\nLast week, FCC chair Tom Wheeler released a fact sheet for his new net neutrality plan, and it was a dramatic one.
