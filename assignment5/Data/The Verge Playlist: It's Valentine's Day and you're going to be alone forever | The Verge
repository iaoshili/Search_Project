Today is a day we celebrate love and hope and love and kissing and sex and hearts and candy and having someone who will care when you die. It's very real, and very serious. Some people don't have that person, and for those people, I've made the only playlist you'll ever need.\nThere's the pinnacle of loneliness: Bonnie Raitt's \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" (also covered amazingly by Prince, but that's not on the internet). There's a desperate torch song: Dusty Springfield's truly pitiful \"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me.\" There's Drake, alone and drunk in a basement: \"Look What You've Done.\" There's the Violent Femmes' pleading, self-loathing \"Please Do Not Go.\" A few loops should take you through the night. I tried to end the playlist on a high note with Daniel Johnston's \"True Love Will Find You in the End,\" but you can decide for yourself if that's actually optimistic.\nListening to this today is truly a feat of crushingly sad endurance.
