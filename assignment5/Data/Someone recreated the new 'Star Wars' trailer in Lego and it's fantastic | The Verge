Maybe you haven't \u2014 that'd be just over 12 hours, which is ridiculous. But have you seen it in Lego?\nThat is to say, have you seen the new droid ball... in Lego?\nWhat about  that new lightsaber ... in Lego?\nIn less than 24 hours,  YouTube user Snooperking has uploaded a shot-for-shot remake of the new Star Wars trailer. It's by no means the last one we'll see \u2014 be it another Lego version or a \" sweded \" version or perhaps a  fan-made remake compiled by Lucasfilm itself \u2014 but it's  no less impressive .\nAnd lest we forget,  Lego and Star Wars are inextricably connected . A Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens video game is inevitable, albeit a little lighter in tone.
