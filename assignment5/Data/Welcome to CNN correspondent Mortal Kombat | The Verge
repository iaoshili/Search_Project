Except, of course, for the wall of correspondents reporting from various campaign headquarters and key cities:\n\"Dammit, I told you we were overdoing it on the Video Daily Doubles!\" pic.twitter.com\/3CWPLF53yw\n\u2014 Ryan Nanni (@celebrityhottub) November 5, 2014\nIf you grew up in the 90s, this should look familiar. Here, let's help you out:\nWow. CNN really going all-out: pic.twitter.com\/Gvr3HaccmH\n\u2014 Dan Hopper (@DanHopp) November 4, 2014\nWe know what you're thinking: CNN would never unlock all those correspondents out of the box! So let us help you with this handy guide.\nFirst, your starting lineup: Alison Grimes (D-KY), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Michelle Nunn (D-GA), David Perdue (R-GA), Mary Landrieu (R-LA), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA). Those who pre-ordered were given the option of either the Extended Democrat or Extended Republican set, which include:\nExtended Democrat set: Kay Hagan (D-NC), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Charlie Crist (D-FL), Braley (D-IA), and Orman (I-KS)\nExtended Republican: Tom Cotton (R-AK), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Scott Walker (R-WI), Joni Ernst (R-IA)\nAll the characters can be unlocked through campaign mode but will also be available to purchase. (Update: the extended Democrat set \u2014 minus Shaheen \u2014 has been given a heavy day-one discount.)\nExtra stages \u2014 Baton Rouge, Lexington, and Lawrenceville \u2014 are unlocked through campaign progression or via the Gerrymandering iOS \/ Android game (be sure to link your account first!).\nTo unlock Reptile, press high punch, high punch, low kick, block, and placate during a primary debate.\nIf you deal a particularly vicious victory speech, Wolf Blitzer will pop up in the bottom right corner and scream \"Toasty!\" in a falsetto voice. If you press down (grabbing a drink of water), you can then face off with Wolf. Beat him to unlock.\nYou can't unlock Anderson Cooper. Don't try. That's just a myth.\n","Title":"Welcome to CNN correspondent Mortal Kombat | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","tldr","us-world"]}
