{"Main text":"Persona 5 looks impossibly cool in this new trailer\n2015's most stylish game\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe still don't know a lot about Persona 5, the latest in the long-running RPG series where Japanese high school students balance saving the world with having a social life. But thanks to the latest trailer, we know at least one thing: the game has an impeccably cool sense of style.\nThe series typically follows a group of students as they attempt to uncover some kind of supernatural plot \u2014Â  sort of like Buffy, only set in Japan \u2014 and Persona 5 looks to be much the same. Whereas Persona 4 had a murder-mystery vibe, it looks like the fifth entry in the series has more of an Ocean's Eleven style, with teens infiltrating fancy parties while wearing masquerade ball masks.\nIn addition to the slick anime cutscenes, the new trailer also gives us our first real glimpse at Persona 5's actual gameplay, which includes everything from slaying monsters to dozing off in class. There's also a character who appears to be an anthropomorphic cat, for some reason. It looks fantastic \u2014 even the menus are oozing style \u2014 and will hopefully make the long wait between entries (Persona 4 originally launched on the PS2 in 2008) worth it for series diehards.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
