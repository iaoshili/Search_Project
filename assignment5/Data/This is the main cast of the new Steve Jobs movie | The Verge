The studio also confirmed, via SlashFilm , what writer Aaron Sorkin had previously detailed from his screenplay (which is based on Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of Jobs), saying the film will take place at \"three iconic product launches,\" culminating in the debut of the first iMac in 1998.\nThe gang's all here\nUniversal says the film will star Michael Fassbender (X-Men: Days of Future Past, Prometheus) as Jobs, with Seth Rogen (The Interview, Neighbors) playing co-founder Steve Wozniak. Other early Apple employees will include Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) as Andy Hertzfeld, Jeff Daniels (The Newsroom, Dumb and Dumber To) playing Apple CEO John Sculley, Adam Shapiro as Avie Tevanian, Kate Winslet (Titanic, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) as a former Mac marketing chief, and Sarah Snook (Predestination) as PR and marketing guru Andrea Cunningham.\nFassbender as David in Prometheus\nThe film also delves into Jobs' personal life, which brings in Katherine Waterston (Inherent Vice) to play Jobs' ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan, as well as Perla Haney-Jardine, Ripley Sobo, and Makenzie Moss, who Universal says will play Lisa Brennan \"at various stages of her life.\"\nFilm crews began work on the project in Jobs' childhood garage in Los Altos, California,  earlier this month , moving up to Berkeley this past weekend to shoot at a local mediterranean restaurant. Today, Universal added that it's begun principal photography of the film in San Francisco, where casting for extras has already been underway for weeks.\nThe film is being directed by Slumdog Millionaire's Danny Boyle and is not to be confused with the 2013 film Jobs, which starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs and Josh Gad as Wozniak. That film sped through production on its way to a theatrical release, but failed to garner any success with critics or at the box office .\n","Title":"This is the main cast of the new Steve Jobs movie | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
