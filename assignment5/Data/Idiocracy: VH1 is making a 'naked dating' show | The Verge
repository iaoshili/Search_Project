{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf The Bachelor is a bit too formal for your tastes, an upcoming series on VH1 may be able to better capture your definition of modern romance. VH1 has ordered a series tentatively titled Naked Dating, and its format is pretty much exactly what you would guess. Each episode will feature a man and a woman going on dates with two separate suitors, both naked, before deciding if they want to continue their potential romances. It's unclear if the featured man and woman will be naked as well.\n\"It\u2019s really about something that we can all relate to.\"\n\"When you go deeper, [the show is] really about something that we can all relate to \u2014 the search for true love,\" Susan Levison, a VH1 programming executive, says in a statement. \"It\u2019s also a series with heart and masterful storytelling \u2014 both earmarks of an engaging, must-watch show.\" Ten hour-long episodes will be made, and \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 will each be \"edited according to network standards.\"\nVH1 acknowledges that the series has a provocative hook, but it believes that the premise won't just be stripping people of their clothing \u2014 but of their preconceived notions about others as well. \"The results will be surprising,\" VH1 writes in a press release. VH1 hasn't announced how long we'll have to wait to watch those surprising results, but with its familiar formula \u2014 lonely strangers on a dating show, whisked off to an exotic locale, and required to get to know one another \u2014 we can probably start making some guesses.\n","Title":"Idiocracy: VH1 is making a 'naked dating' show | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
