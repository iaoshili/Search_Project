{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChris Pratt might have already nailed the role of the Walkman-loving Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy, but Universal hopes he has another superhero \u2014 or three \u2014 up his sleeve. The studio has signed Pratt to star in an upcoming film adaptation of Cowboy Ninja Viking.\nPratt will most certainly play Duncan, the titular hero of the 2009 graphic novel whose multiple personality disorder has been optimized to make him three different assassins in one (hence the unusual name). He's one of many other so-called \"triplets\" \u2014 like Sniper Archer Clothing Designer and Applebee's Waiter Army Sergeant Frontiersman \u2014 who were originally trained to be super agents. In the graphic novels, Duncan tracks down some of the triplets who go rogue after the program is disbanded, but  according to Collider the film's script sees the protagonist seek out the billionaire mastermind behind the experimental program instead.\n\u201C @jbkelly80 : @prattprattpratt pic.twitter.com\/lNR1NYxT56 \u201D YES! But who is our director? That is the question. Who do u think it should be?\n\u2014 chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) November 20, 2014\nIt's not yet clear if Pratt will play all three versions of Duncan \u2014 the Cowboy, the Ninja, and the Viking \u2014 or just one of them, though Collider and  Deadline note that the original script calls for three different actors. Nevertheless, the whole thing could end up being quite a bit of fun, especially with Chris Pratt's comedic talent in the mix. The actor confirmed his involvement in the project on Twitter, but he did not clarify what role he will play. Just don't expect to see the movie any time soon: it's still on the lookout for a director.\n","Title":"Chris Pratt to star in film adaptation of 'Cowboy Ninja Viking' graphic novel | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
