{"Main text":"Sinclair's ZX Spectrum is coming back as a retro gaming console\nRetro in both look and function\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSir Clive Sinclair earned his knighthood by building some of the earliest affordable computers for the home back in the 1980s. One of his best-loved machines was the  ZX Spectrum \u2014 think of it as the UK equivalent of the  Commodore 64 \u2014 which is now being recreated by  an Indiegogo project endorsed by Sir Clive himself. The new Sinclair Spectrum Vega simplifies the original keyboard into a rectangular gamepad and comes preloaded with 1,000 games for the Spectrum. What's more, you can use an SD card to load up old Spectrum games you still have lying around, and the company behind the project, Retro Computers, promises to iteratively release more free games once the console is out.\nThe price of the ARM-based Spectrum Vega is £100 (about $150), and deliveries of the first 1,000 units are expected to begin in February of next year, provided the funding campaign goes to plan. It's all very geeky and soaked in nostalgia, but there's one unforgivable flaw to the whole thing: the £20 \"Byte\" funding tier is only four times the size of the £5 \"Bit\" funding.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
