{"Main text":"Verizon trolls the FCC's net neutrality vote with a blog post written in morse code\nAn epic telegraphic Title II #TBT\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday the  FCC voted to apply the Title II regulations of the Telecommunications Act to broadband internet services. The commission argues that it has updated the rules for our modern age, but opponents of the plan have countered that it relies on antiquated language meant for older technologies. Verizon, responding to the vote on its public policy blog, decided to take this argument to its logical extreme.\n\"FCC\u2019s \u2018Throwback Thursday\u2019 Move Imposes 1930s Rules on the Internet\" reads the headline to a  blog post written entirely in morse code. If you don't have access to a telegraph operator, Verizon has also provided a  handy link to a PDF , written in smudged ink by typewriter, because these new rules are based on outdated technology. Get it?\nIronically, Verizon has described itself as a Title II common carrier\nThe actual content of the post is doomsaying about the impact the new rules will likely have. \"Today\u2019s decision by the FCC to encumber broadband Internet services with badly antiquated regulations is a radical step that presages a time of uncertainty for consumers, innovators, and investors.\"\nIt's particularly ironic that Verizon is trying to roast the FCC for relying on Title II. After all, as first reported by The Verge,  Verizon described itself as a Title II common carrier when it was trying to gain rights of way, pole access, and taxpayer subsidies to build out its FiOS fiber optic internet service in New Jersey.\n","Title":"Verizon trolls the FCC's net neutrality vote with a blog post written in morse code | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","tech"]}
