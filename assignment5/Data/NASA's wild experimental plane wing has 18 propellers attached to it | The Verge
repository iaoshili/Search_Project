{"Main text":"NASA's wild experimental plane wing has 18 propellers attached to it\nAnd it looks nuts\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNASA is working to make a more efficient, electric-powered plane, and the proposed wings for it look like something out of a dream. Eighteen small engines sit atop the 31-foot wingspan and work together to lift and propel the plane forward. The wings are part of NASA's Leading Edge Asynchronous Propellers Technology (LEAPTech) project .\nThe propellers are all electric, powered by lithium iron phosphate batteries. Each propeller can be operated independently at various speeds to optimize power, with all 18 engines providing lift during takeoff.\nIf this all sounds too good to be true, that's because it is \u2014 for now. NASA will ground test the wings over the next several months. During the testing stage, the wings will be mounted to a modified truck called the Hybrid-Electric Integrated Systems Testbed (HEIST), and the truck will drive up to 70 mph across a dry lakebed in California. LEAPTech's final planned cruising speed will be 200 mph with a maximum electric-powered reach of 230 mph, Popular Science reports .\nResearchers hope once the LEAPTech wing is improved, it can be used to create a new environmentally and economically efficient X-plane.\nVerge Video Archives: Nearly vomiting in a Red Bull stunt plane\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
