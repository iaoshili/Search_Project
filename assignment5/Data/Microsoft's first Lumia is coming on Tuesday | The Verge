Microsoft officially  unveiled its new branding for upcoming Lumia handsets , and Tuesday\u2019s launch will mark the first time the company drops the Nokia name on its smartphones. While many are hoping for a flagship phone, sources familiar with Microsoft\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the company will launch a budget Lumia handset next week.\nRecently leaked images revealed Microsoft\u2019s first Lumia, and the  specifications indicate it will be a low-end device targeted at the masses. It\u2019s not clear how Microsoft will name its first Lumia, and the company could opt to ditch the number scheme that Nokia has used in the past. Microsoft\u2019s first Lumia will include a 5-inch display with 1GB RAM, a 5-megapixel camera, and 1.2GHz Snapdragon processor. Surprisingly, Microsoft is adding a forward-facing camera to this particular model, something Nokia chose to cut from the recent low-end Lumia handsets.
