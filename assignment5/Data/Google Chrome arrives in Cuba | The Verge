{"Main text":"Google Chrome arrives in Cuba\nGoogle brings its browser to isolated island nation following Eric Schmidt's campaign for greater web access\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle Chrome is now available for download in Cuba, one of the world's most isolated internet regimes. Google announced the move in a short  Google+ post Wednesday, noting that American sanctions against Cuba and other countries have made it more difficult for the company to launch products abroad. Although Cuban internet users have been able to access Chrome through unofficial channels, they'll now be able to download the web browser directly from google.com.cu.\nThis week's announcement comes after Google Chairman Eric Schmidt and a delegation of web activists visited Cuba in June, pushing for a free and open internet. The government of Raúl Castro has  inched toward greater web access in recent months, with new fiber-optic connections and more than 100 public internet cafes, but the outlook remains bleak. According to government figures, just  3 percent of Cubans have regular access to the internet, and broadband subscriptions are among the  most expensive in the world.\nGoogle has campaigned for greater web access in other isolated countries, as well. Google launched Chrome in both Syria and Iran in recent years, while Schmidt has made trips to  Myanmar and  North Korea .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
