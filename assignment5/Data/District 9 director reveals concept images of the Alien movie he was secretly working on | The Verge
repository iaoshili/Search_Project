{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Alien series may have taken a sharp turn downhill after its second film, but District 9 director Neill Blomkamp is \u2014 at least somewhat \u2014 interested in stepping in to save it. Blomkamp posted over a half-dozen pieces of concept art  to Instagram yesterday depicting an Alien movie that he was working on, without any studio's knowledge or approval. Blomkamp's film seems to take place after Aliens, but in a world where the series' third film was never made, allowing Ripley and Hicks to work together again. The film also would have gone inside the mysterious and manipulative Weyland Corporation and put Ripley in what looks like a semi-organic Xenomorph flight suit.\nIt doesn't sound like Blomkamp's vision will be leaving the page anytime soon, however. On Instagram, Blomkamp says that though he loves the concept, he doesn't think that he's going to be working on it any more. \"Woulda rocked,\" Blomkamp writes. \"Was a mental stroll into the world Ridley Scott created.\" An unverified Twitter account linked to Blomkamp elaborates,  writing , \"I just feel like I might do something else instead.\" The good news for anyone hoping to see this movie made is that Blomkamp isn't stopping because the studio made him \u2014 in fact, he doesn't even think the studio knew he was working on it. And as he tells one commenter on Instagram: \"Fox never said no.\"\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:30pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:32pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:40pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:49pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:56pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 6:06pm PST\n","Title":"District 9 director reveals concept images of the Alien movie he was secretly working on | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
