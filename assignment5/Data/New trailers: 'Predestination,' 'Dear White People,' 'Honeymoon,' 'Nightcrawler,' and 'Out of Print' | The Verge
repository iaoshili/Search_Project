{"Main text":"20 Comments\nHope you aren\u2019t already overwhelmed from Comic-Con . The huge convention isn\u2019t even halfway through, and we\u2019ve already gotten looks at some of the most exciting movies and TV shows coming up over the next year. And while Comic-Con may be the epicenter of entertainment this week, there have been a good number of movie trailers coming out around it too. Below is five of our favorite new trailers and three that you\u2019ll want to watch if you missed them earlier.\nPredestination\nCrime\u2019s a lot easier to solve when you deal with it before it ever happens. Predestination has Ethan Hawke and Noah Taylor (of Game of Thrones) traveling through time to fight some seriously mysterious crime. It\u2019s coming to Australia next month, but additional premiere dates haven\u2019t been announced.\nDear White People\nThe first full trailer for Dear White People makes it perfectly clear why everyone whose seen this film has been raving about it: it\u2019s smart, sharp, and seriously hilarious. It\u2019ll be in theaters October 17th.\nHoneymoon\nHoneymoon may start out like the gorgeous and serene trip that it\u2019s supposed to be, but things start to change fast. Something happens to the newlywed wife, and way out in the woods, things get pretty strange. It\u2019ll be released September 12th.\nNightcrawler\nDesperate for a job, the star of Nightcrawler makes his way into the terrifying world of crime journalism in LA, where he chases cop cars to be the first on the scene of the latest tragedy. At first it\u2019s the portrait of a driven man, but that's only until the job starts getting to him. It\u2019ll be out in theaters October 17th.\nOut of Print\nIt\u2019s no secret that film is dying in favor of digital, but some movie theaters are trying to stand up for the classic format. The documentary Out of Print looks at just what\u2019s happening and asks a few film lovers who you may recognize \u2014 including Kevin Smith, Rian Johnson, and Patton Oswalt \u2014 to chime in.\nYoung Ones\nAside from being a totally gorgeous sci-fi set out in the desert, Young Ones just happens to feature a replica of Google\u2019s creepy BigDog robot. You can read more about the movie in our report from its debut at Sundance , and you\u2019ll be able to see it in theaters on October 17th.\nThe Imitation Game\nComputer-science pioneer Alan Turing\u2019s work as a World War II codebreaker is the subject of The Imitation Game , which will head to theaters on November 21st. The film doesn\u2019t just touch on Turing\u2019s work, but on his personal life too, including his struggle as a gay man in England at a time when homosexual acts were illegal.\nWhen Marnie Was There\nHayao Miyazaki may have retired, but his animation studio is still turing out some absolutely beautiful new work. Its next film comes from the director of The Secret World of Arrietty and is an adaptation of a children\u2019s novel about a girl becoming friends with someone a bit more ethereal than herself. The trailer is only in Japanese for now, but you can bet that it\u2019ll be translated soon enough.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Predestination,' 'Dear White People,' 'Honeymoon,' 'Nightcrawler,' and 'Out of Print' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
