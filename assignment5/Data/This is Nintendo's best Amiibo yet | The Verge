{"Main text":"This is Nintendo's best Amiibo yet\nA yarn Yoshi might just be too cute\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNintendo's Amiibo initiative \u2014 which introduces plastic toys into the world of video games \u2014  has been very successful so far. But an upcoming figure is so adorable it might  give even Link a run for his money . To coincide with the release of Yoshi's Woolly World on the Wii U later this year, Nintendo will be releasing a special Yoshi Amiibo that's actually made of yarn, just like its in-game counterpart. It's painfully cute, and comes with an added benefit: when you scan it into the game, a second Yoshi will appear to assist your playthrough. Yoshi's Woolly World is expected to launch during the first half of 2015, and you'll be able to get the Amiibo in green, pink, or blue.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
