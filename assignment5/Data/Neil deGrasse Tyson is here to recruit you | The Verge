{"Main text":"248 Comments\nIt was the television event that science geeks worldwide had been waiting for. On Sunday night, the much-hyped Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey premiered with an inspiring episode that offered viewers a sweeping tour of the solar system and humanity\u2019s (decidedly wee) place in the universe. It also introduced them to their guide through the series\u2019 planned 13-episode run: Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist and vocal science advocate, who will fill the shoes of Cosmos\u2019 original host, the late Carl Sagan.\nBut while the reboot of Sagan\u2019s 1980 classic will readily attract science aficionados, that\u2019s not exactly the audience Tyson is gunning for. Chatting over a glass of wine to celebrate the show\u2019s premiere (a glass the connoisseur noted \u201Ccould use another eight years in the bottle\u201D), Tyson was emphatic that \u201Ceveryone is the audience.\u201D\n\"Science is not the purview of the demographic, it's the purview of us all,\" he says. \"Cosmos, at its best, not only shares with you the moving frontier of science, but shows you why knowing that matters.\"\nTo that effect, the show\u2019s distribution is going big: it premiered with an unprecedented simulcast on 10 US networks, and will air weekly on both Fox and National Geographic channels in more than 180 countries around the world.\n\"An exploration nation, as a culture, can influence how people think about their future.\"\nThe import of that wide reach isn\u2019t something Tyson takes lightly. Indeed, it\u2019s yet the latest iteration of his ongoing efforts to convey the urgent importance of research into science and technology \u2014 a realm where he\u2019s seen the US fall woefully short in recent decades. \"As an American, I grew up in an era where we led the world in everything. Everything!\" he says of groundbreaking innovations like computers, television, and radio. \"So much [American invention] shaped the 20th century, and I don\u2019t want to be on the sidelines for the 21st century. I want to be there.\"\nInvigorating viewers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise care about the world of science is, to Tyson, one small part of addressing that problem. Not to mention that a splashy television program, airing on major networks and bolstered by impressive special effects and a mammoth publicity drive, is bound to make science seem just a little bit hipper \u2014 especially to younger generations. \"Maybe you say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to go to space, I want to be an attorney.\u2019 Well, you can be an attorney that manages the mineral rights of the next asteroid. That\u2019d be really cool,\" he says. \"An exploration nation, as a culture, can influence how people think about their future \u2014 and that only comes about through science and technology.\"\nFor now, Tyson is happy to act as the very public face of the scientific cause \u2014 he\u2019s recently been profiled in the New Yorker, posed for a selfie with President Obama, and was a keynote speaker at SXSW. But when Cosmos comes to an end this season, he\u2019s intent on making a shift back into the more private life of a scientist, husband, and father. \"Next time I'd rather just stay home, I\u2019d rather let someone else do it,\" says Tyson, who lives with his wife and two kids in Manhattan and remains director of the Hayden Planetarium and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History. But his role as an advocate for scientific exploration won\u2019t change \u2014 and the research Tyson plans to undertake next might even make that advocacy stronger. \"As a scientist, [my research] is what fuels my energy to even communicate in the first place,\" he says. \"[So] I\u2019ll go back to the lab. I\u2019m ready. After I go to the Bahamas, then I\u2019m going to the lab.\"\nPhotography by Michael Shane\n","Title":"Neil deGrasse Tyson is here to recruit you | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","science","entertainment"]}
