{"Main text":"BET is bringing Punk'd back, and no one is safe\nMaybe we're all being Punk'd\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMTV's Punk'd, the show that spawned a million ill-advised and unchaperoned home spin-offs (probably), is coming back. BET announced today that it will be reviving a version of the prank show \"tailored\" to the network's audience,Â  The Hollywood Reporter reports .\nExcluding a short-lived revival in 2012, during which a rotating roster of celebrities like Justin Bieber and Nick Cannon hosted, Punk'd has been off the air since 2007. Details on BET's reboot are slim. There's no word yet who will host the series or when it will premiere.\nUntil then, a word of warning to all vaguely famous people: watch out. Even if Ashton Kutcher already managed to convince you that you ruined Christmas back in 2003, that doesn't give you immunity.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
