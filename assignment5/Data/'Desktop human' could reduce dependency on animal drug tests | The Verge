Senior scientist Rashi Iyer from Los Alamos National Laboratory and a team of researchers is close to finishing  development on ATHENA , or the Advanced Tissue-engineered Human Ectypal Network Analyzer, which acts as a small, replicated body for toxicity tests. The five-year, $19 million effort wants to provide an alternative to animal drug tests by using surrogate organs and mass spectrometry technologies to screen how new drugs could affect the human body.\nATHENA is currently made of a synthetic liver, heart, lung, and kidney, all of which are about the size of a smartphone screen and work like human organs. Eventually the team wants to expand from only organs to all the vessels and tissues surrounding them, making ATHENA work more like an actual body. \"The ultimate goal is to build a lung that breathes, a heart that pumps, a liver that metabolizes and a kidney that excretes \u2014 all connected by a tubing infrastructure much akin to the way blood vessels connect our organs,\" Iyer says.\nEach organ is the size of a smartphone screen\nScientists have been trying to mimic chemical reactions and even organ processes outside the body for some time, using lab-on-a-chip devices  designed to mimic individual organs . ATHENA essentially takes those scaled-down processes and, rather than placing them on a chip, puts them into synthetic organs. ATHENA's connected organs could also let researchers not only test drugs on one specific organ, but also see how the drug could affect other organs simultaneously \u2014 something that singular devices like chips currently cannot do. The project has a long way to go before it could totally replace animals in drug tests, but it does show promise as a future alternative.\n","Title":"'Desktop human' could reduce dependency on animal drug tests | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
