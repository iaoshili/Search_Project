{"Main text":"A paid version of Tinder is reportedly launching today\nTinder Plus adds undo button and passport feature, for a price\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTinder will introduce a paid version of its popular dating app on Monday,  TechCrunch reports . The paid version,  known as Tinder Plus , adds two main features: a \"rewind\" option that lets users reconsider the last person they rejected (\"left-swiped\"), and a passport function that lets them swipe in different cities. Citing sources familiar with the situation, TechCrunch reports that the paid version will be available for under $10 in the US, though prices will reportedly vary across different markets.\nPaying for the service will also remove ads, which are reportedly launching on Tinder's network later this month. Last week,  Recode reported that the Los Angeles-based startup is building an ad product that will be led by Brian Norgard, who co-founded the Tappy ephemeral messaging app that Tinder  acquired earlier this year .\nTinder has been testing an \"unlimited like\" feature in Tinder Plus in recent weeks. It's terrible.\nThe company has been testing Tinder Plus across Europe over the past few weeks, with prices ranging from $0.99 to $19.99 per month. I was forced to update to the freemium version of the app last week, which limits my likes unless I pay $9.99 per month. Last month, the company said it was  beta testing the 24-hour right-swipe limit as a way to crack down on porn-y spambots, but as  Business Insider notes , the feature has resulted in some rather negative feedback in App Store reviews.\nIt's not yet clear whether limited likes will be included in the version of Tinder Plus that launches today. (TechCrunch makes no mention of it in its report.) A Tinder spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n","Title":"A paid version of Tinder is reportedly launching today | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
