A new trailer for Guillermo del Toro's The Strain has been released, and it sets the tone for the upcoming apocalyptic vampire thriller. Based on the horror novel series of the same name, the show follows Dr. Ephraim Goodweather as he and others confront a viral outbreak of vampirism within the city.\nA viral outbreak of vampirism\nThe 30-second video opens with the NYC Center of Disease Control investigating a grounded Boeing 777. From there, it leads to glimpses of some key characters from the series, including what may be the primary antagonist. The new footage also shows more of the morphological structure of the show's vampires.\nAlthough  earlier promo videos have already intimated how alien these monstrosities are, the latest clip presents a closer look at their optical abnormalities and lack of hair. There is also a shot of a body on an autopsy table, before the video closes with the sight of a vampire's proboscis in action and what looks to be its unhinged, mutated jaw. So far, the series, which stars House of Cards' Corey Stoll, appears to be staying relatively loyal to its gruesome source material. The Strain will premiere on FX on July 13th.\n","Title":"New trailer for 'The Strain' shows del Toro's gruesome vampires in action | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
