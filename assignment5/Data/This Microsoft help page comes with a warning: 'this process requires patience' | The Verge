{"Main text":"Any past purchases from the Windows Store\nAny other non-Xbox subscription\nOh, and I almost forgot. Any funds tied to your Gamertag will be lost during the transfer.\nSo I took a deep breath and dove in. I bought a bunch of Mass Effect 3 DLC to burn through the cash left on my account, and went through the process of initiating the Gamertag transfer on my old Xbox 360. After punching in passwords and waiting, a notice appeared: Error 80154013: \"This Microsoft account already has an Xbox membership.\"\nSomehow, my new email address had been tied to a generic Xbox Live Gamertag, Player067106467. I kid you not.\nNow, this would be funny if it didn't throw a wrench into the entire operation. The error code led me toÂ  another Microsoft support article . And whoever wrote it knew that he was about to put people through some 21st century misery. The article warns: \"This process requires patience.\"\nI'm pretty sure no one at Microsoft could be bothered to design a way for people to switch accounts, because the process described is truly dreadful. Since there's no way to delete a Gamertag from a Microsoft account, I first had to make an entirely new, bogus email address. I'd then have to transfer the Player067106467 Gamertag to that bogus email address \u2014 a process that first requires me to set up that blank Xbox profile on my Xbox 360. Once the blank Gamertag was removed from the email address I cared about, I could then try to transfer my real Gamertag.\nAs you can probably guess, this required lots of patience, especially as I typed in long passwords and email addresses with that crummy Xbox 360 d-pad. After I jumped through all the hoops, a message appeared:\n\"Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now.\"\nExasperated, I tossed in the towel. Microsoft: 1. Dante: 0.\nVerge Video: Play Xbox games on any Windows 10 device\n","Title":"This Microsoft help page comes with a warning: 'this process requires patience' | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","gaming","tldr","tech"]}
