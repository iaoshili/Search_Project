{"Main text":"TCL's 110-inch curved 4K TV is the definition of CES spectacle\nBehold this amazing thing no one will ever own\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLook at this utterly massive TV. TCL has somehow managed to go even crazier than Samsung on the show floor at CES, showcasing this 110-inch curved 4K televison. And you might consider that strange since Samsung has a 110-incher of its own. But TCL had the Guiness Book of World Records come out to take a measurement and confirm that its huge curved thing is slightly bigger than Samsung's huge curved thing.\nWill you ever be able to buy one? Unlikely. There's no pricing or availability information to speak of. Would it even fit in your house? Through what door? No matter. This is what CES is all about. Anything Samsung or any other tech stalwart can do, there's a smaller competitor trying to best them and stand out in this enormous crowd. With a curvature of 7000R, TCL says it's humongous TV has such a dramatic picture depth that it approaches glasses-free 3D. Sure, it looks pretty okay, but totally impractical for most people. Still. Just look at this thing.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
