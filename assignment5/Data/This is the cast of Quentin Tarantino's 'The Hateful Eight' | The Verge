{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter  some uncertainty earlier this year, Quentin Tarantino is really moving forward with The Hateful Eight, and all of the film's big stars have just been announced. That includes each member of the titular Hateful Eight, plus one bonus star, all of which you can see below. A first description of what the plot will be like has now been released too, and it sounds as though the film, set some years after the Civil War, will find all eight of these people converging in Wyoming and getting stuck at a stagecoach stop amid a heavy storm. Tarantino is  filming in 70mm , so the picture should look amazing, and it's targeting a release next year.\nSamuel L. Jackson\nThis one's self explanatory. Jackson has been a recurring collaborator of Tarantino's, so it only makes sense that we'd see him here. He'll be playing a bounty hunter and a former soldier for the union.\n(Photo credit: Helga Esteb \/ Shutterstock)\nKurt Russell\nRussell's probably most known for his work with John Carpenter, starring in Escape from New York and The Thing. He hasn't been in so many huge films lately, but he did work with Tarantino back in 2007 on Death Proof. He'll be playing a bounty hunter in Hateful Eight.\n(Photo credit: Helga Esteb \/ Shutterstock)\nJennifer Jason Leigh\nEven if you don't immediately recognize Leigh, you've probably seen her before. She's been all over the place in film, appearing in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Short Cuts, The Machinist, and Synecdoche, New York, among many others. She'll be playing a fugitive here, and it'll be her first time working with Tarantino.\n(Photo credit: s_bukley \/ Shutterstock)\nWalton Goggins\nThe Hateful Eight will be Goggins second film with Tarantino, having had a small role in Django Unchained back in 2012. He'll be playing a \"southern renegade\" here who claims to be a sheriff.\n(Photo credit: Helga Esteb \/ Shutterstock)\nDemian Bichir\nBichir was most recently seen starring in FX's The Bridge as a Mexican homicide detective. The Hateful Eight will have him playing the operator of a men's clothing store, for his first time working with Tarantino.\n(Photo credit: cinemafestival \/ Shutterstock)\nTim Roth\nIt's been a good while since Roth and Tarantino worked together, but he's one of many classic actors in Tarantino's films, having starred in both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. It's a good reunion to see. He'll be playing a hangman here.\nMichael Madsen\nAnother old actor in Tarantino's roster, The Hateful Eight will be Madsen's third film with him. You should definitely remember Madsen from Reservoir Dogs, where he plays the totally insane Mr. Blonde. He was also in the Kill Bill films. He'll be playing a \"cow-puncher\" here, which Google explains is just another word for cowboy that no one really uses.\n(Photo credit: cinemafestival \/ Shutterstock)\nBruce Dern\nBruce Dern had a small role in Django Unchained, but more recently, he's been receiving a ton of attention for his performance in Nebraska last year. He'll be playing a Confederate general in Hateful Eight, which sounds like a pretty perfect casting.\nChanning Tatum\nThat's right. This will be Tatum's first film with Tarantino, and notably, he's the only one on this list who isn't part of the titular eight. There's no word on what his role will be.\n","Title":"This is the cast of Quentin Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
