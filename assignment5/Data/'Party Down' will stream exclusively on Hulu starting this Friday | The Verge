{"Main text":"'Party Down' will stream exclusively on Hulu starting this Friday\nAre we having fun yet?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere's something to do for this Labor Day weekend that  doesn't involve inclement weather : stay inside and watch Party Down on Hulu. Starz's cult comedy ran for two seasons starting in 2009, earning critical acclaim but never finding a large enough audience to keep going. The show enjoyed a brief stint on Netflix before  getting pulled a few months before  Starz left Netflix entirely .\nStarting this Friday, the entire Party Down series returns to the internet as an exclusive to Hulu \u2014 and the first five episodes will be free for non-subscribers (though likely still ad supported) for a limited time. It's a chance to see a group of actors who were on the precipice of bigger things, including Adam Scott (Parks and Recreation), Lizzy Caplan (Masters of Sex), and Jane Lynch (Glee).\nThough it hasn't had the same success as Netflix in terms of high profile originals, Hulu has spent its summer nabbing exclusive rights to stream  South Park ,  Brooklyn Nine-Nine , and other major TV shows.\nSeriously, if the weather isn't pretty this weekend \u2014 or even if it is \u2014 consider skipping the barbecue and doing a Party Down marathon.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
