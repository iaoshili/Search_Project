{"Main text":"Banksy went to the Gaza Strip to paint new artwork\nThe two-minute video is a darkly satirical travel ad\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe man, woman, or collective known as Banksy released a video this week showcasing new artwork created in the Gaza Strip, and, understandably, it's pretty dark. As  The Daily Dot notes, the two-minute clip plays like a satirical travel ad, portraying war-torn Gaza as a kind of aspirational vacation spot. Titled \"Make this the year YOU discover a new destination,' the video follows Banksy \u2014 or a man presumed to be Banksy \u2014 as he enters the Strip and paints a series of images on the rubble inside.\nIt's a very dark satire\nThe video begins with \"Banksy\" entering Gaza via a \"network of illegal tunnels\" (the caption says it's \"well away from the tourist track\"). It juxtaposes images of Palestinian children playing with images of armed Israeli soldiers, and pans slowly over the destruction in Gaza before moving to a shot of the artist at work.\nThree new pieces of art appear in the video: a kneeling man in apparent distress painted on an abandoned door, an Israeli guard tower reimagined as amusement park swings, and a giant white kitten playing with a ball of string.\nBanksy's identity has yet to be confirmed. Some sources say  Banksy is most likely a woman with a background in the art world. Canadian artist Chris Healey has maintained since 2010 that Banksy is a  team of seven people led by a woman .\nIf you're wondering about the meaning behind the white cat, the  Banksy website explains , \"A local man came up and said, 'Please \u2014 what does this mean?' I explained I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website \u2014 but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens.\"\n","Title":"Banksy went to the Gaza Strip to paint new artwork | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","us-world"]}
