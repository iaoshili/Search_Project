{"Main text":"Mazda puts Le Mans heritage on display with LM55 Vision Gran Turismo car\nPlayable in Gran Turismo 6 on the PlayStation 3 right now\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMazda's Christmas gift to the world of racing fanatics has been revealed as the LM55 Vision Gran Turismo concept supercar. It joins a growing cadre of outlandishly designed vehicles that car manufacturers have been contributing to Gran Turismo 6 since the game's release last year. Challenged by Polyphony Digital chief Kaz Yamauchi to produce their grandest vision for the ideal Gran Turismo racing car, marques like Mercedes-Benz and Toyota have responded with enthusiasm and even built real-world mockups to show off the undulating curves of their supremely aerodynamic concept autos. Mazda's approach is even more focused on the racing aspect, as the company has taken its 1991 Le Mans win as the basis for the LM55 concept that it's now added to the Gran Turismo 6 roster. Carbon fiber components and a monocoque chassis form the basis for an aggressive design that has \"blended agility with elegance.\"\nTo give the LM55 a test drive, download the latest update for Gran Turismo 6 on the PS3 and browse to the Vision GT car menu, which also includes all the other Vision Gran Turismo supercars introduced so far.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
