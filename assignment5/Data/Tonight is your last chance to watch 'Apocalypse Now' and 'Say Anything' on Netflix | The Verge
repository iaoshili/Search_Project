{"Main text":"Tonight is your last chance to watch 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Say Anything' on Netflix\n53 movies will disappear on November 1st\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLooking for some scary (or maybe not-so-scary) movies to binge on along with your Halloween candy tonight? If you're a Netflix subscriber, here's the list you should check out first, because all of these titles will be disappearing come November 1st. As is the case every month, Netflix is rotating out some of its vast library of movie titles and replacing them with new ones. The  reasons have to do with the licensing agreements Netflix makes with with content providers, which generally limit streaming rights for specific titles to only a few months. For us avid viewers, it means we all have to make a choice on what movies we want to catch before they turn into a pumpkin disappear from  Big Red forever. I've tried to help with some of my own top picks. Scroll down for the full list, via  Now Streaming .\n1. Apocalypse Now (1979)(R)\nFrancis Ford Coppola's legendary Vietnam war epic (loosely based off Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness) is disturbing and engrossing and fascinating all at the same time. If you haven't seen it yet, don't let the long running time (147 minutes for the regular version and 195 minutes for Redux, the extended version) dissuade you.\n2. American Psycho (2000)(R)\nLong before he was Batman or  Steve Jobs , Christian Bale was perfectly cast as the deranged, murderous and laughably vain yuppy at the center of this dark look at '80s Wall Street (adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same).\n3. Say Anything (1989)(PG-13)\nThe movie that made John Cusack into a superstar\/teen heartthrob. The movie where the \" holding up a boom box outside your crush's window at night \" and blasting Peter Gabriel's \"In Your Eyes\" meme came from. Also writer Cameron Crowe's directorial debut. A late '80s romantic comedy classic. If you haven't seen this movie, you're doing it wrong. It is fantastic.\n4. Broadcast News (1987)(R)\nThis movie should be required viewing for all journalists or wannabe journalists. Like the title suggests, it's about a broadcast news network, specifically a producer and two TV reporters. It's got James L. Brooks and William Hurt at the top of their games. Basically like HBO's Newsroom with less schmaltz and more gut-punching raw emotion.\n5. Serenity (2005) (PG-13)\nJoss Whedon's continuation of his beloved canceled cult sci-fi Western series Firefly. 'Nuff said.\n6. Thelma and Louise (1991) (R)\nRidley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, etc) directed this movie about two women who decide to YOLO it up before that terrible term even existed. Also Brad Pitt shows up as a hunky cowboy (I find him to be really great and memorable in supporting parts like this \u2014 also see True Romance).\n7. The Ninth Gate (1999) (R)\nOh man, this probably belongs way higher up on the list now that I'm thinking about it, because today is Halloween and this horror\/thriller is all about a wealthy stylish international Satanic cult. It's got good weird Johnny Depp in it. It's also pretty explicit and cheesy but wonderful if you're into that sort of thing.\n8. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)(PG)\nThe definition of a classic movie. Paul Newman and Robert Redford star as the titular bank-robbing outlaws and they're full of wisecracks as \"the law\" (other cowboys) chases them around the old American West. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. You should see this around the same time as Thelma and Louise as this is clearly the model for it and basically all subsequent buddy outlaw comedies.\n9. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966) (R)\nThis is the quintessential Spaghetti Western. Directed by the maestro of the genre, Sergio Leone, and starring Clint Eastwood, America's best cowboy action star (sorry John Wayne), it's actually not even my favorite spaghetti western (Once Upon a Time in the West), but it's by and large the most influential and is thus required viewing for anyone who likes film.\nI probably should have put a 10th movie on here to make it even but whatever.
