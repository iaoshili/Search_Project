{"Main text":"Sci-fi! Action! Comedy! Biopic! Frozen! This week's new trailers include basically everything you could ask for. Nine of the best are below. All of them are for films coming out in the next few months, so get ready.\nThe Divergent Series: Insurgent\nI kind of love the Insurgent trailers because they're just cool shots interspersed with weird moments, like the amazingly strange music at the end of this trailer. This is supposedly the final trailer before Insurgent comes out on March 20th.\nThe Gunman\nThe director of Taken is back with a new movie about a former government agent \/ soldier running around Europe trying to stop some bad dudes who have taken a woman he loves. This time, Sean Penn stars instead of Liam Neeson. It'll be in theaters March 20th.\nWelcome to Me\nThis looks weird and wonderful. Kristen Wiig stars as an emotionally troubled and insecure woman who wins the lottery and decides to put those winnings toward a talk show, starring herself. The results look sweet, uncomfortable, and funny, and you'll be able to see it May 1st.\nLove & Mercy\nThe biopic Love & Mercy has Paul Dano and John Cusack playing Beach Boys' genius Brian Wilson during different stages of his life. Dano is the film's young Wilson, during the days of his band's breakout success; Cusack plays Wilson later in life, as he's trying to come back from years of mental health issues. At the very least, it should have a sweet soundtrack. It opens June 5th.\nWhile We're Young\nNoah Baumbach's next film has a great cast \u2014 Ben Stiller, Naomi Watts, Adam Driver, Amanda Seyfried \u2014Â all playing off of each other in romantic \/ comedic \/ wacky \/ etc. situations. It's a look at the energy of a young couple and an older couple's attempts to maintain that spark into middle age. It'll be out March 27th.\nThe Riot Club\nThis is like A Clockwork Orange but about rich Oxford kids instead. It's directed by Lone Scherfig, who made the wonderful An Education, and it looks both gorgeous and raucous. You'll be able to see it in the US starting March 27th.\nFrozen Fever\nHate all you want, there are a lot of people who love Disney's Frozen. And Disney clearly knows it: the only way to watch this short is to buy a ticket to its live-action Cinderella. That's not a bad way to sell some tickets. It'll be out March 13th.\nEva\nHey! It's another movie about cyborgs coming out this year! Naturally, it looks pretty cool, even though it's not entirely clear what's happening at every point in this trailer. Still, it seems like this film creates a smart and tense world, at least until robots start attacking. It'll start to play in theaters March 13th.\nSnow Girl and the Dark Crystal\nWHAT EVEN IS THIS???\n","Title":"New trailers: The Gunman, Insurgent, Frozen Fever, and more | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
