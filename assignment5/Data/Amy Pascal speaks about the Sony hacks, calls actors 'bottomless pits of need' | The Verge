{"Main text":"Amy Pascal speaks about the Sony hacks, calls actors 'bottomless pits of need'\nShe'll also join the production team for Sony's Spider-Man series\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmy Pascal spoke publicly yesterday for the first time since stepping down as the chief of Sony Pictures,  Recode reports . At the Women in the World conference in San Francisco, Pascal talked openly, if vaguely, about  the Sony hacks , pay inequality, and needy Hollywood stars.\n\"What am I doing here?\"\nThe conversation, moderated by former Newsweek editor Tina Brown, started off slowly as Pascal questioned the need for a public discussion. \"Everyone knows everything about me,\" she said. \"What am I doing here?\"\nThat's a fair enough question, but Pascal is not out of the public eye yet. She announced this week that she'll join the production team for Sony and Marvel's  upcoming Spider-Man series , and is also expected to work on a version of Cleopatra and a live-action Barbie movie.\nPascal's thoughts on the Sony hacks were both unsurprising and oddly dismissive. She addressed racist comments she made about Barack Obama, calling the media's reaction to them \"horrible,\" but noted that having her private discussions leaked to the public was \"strangely freeing.\"\n\"I run a business. People want to work for less money, I pay them less money.\"\nShe waved off mean comments made in her emails \u2014 like calling Angelina Jolie a \"minimally talented spoiled brat\" \u2014 because hey, it's Hollywood. \"Everybody understood because we all live in this weird thing called Hollywood,\" she said. \"If we all actually were nice, it wouldn\u2019t work.\" As for accusations of pay inequality, Pascal says that's just how the game is played. \"I run a business. People want to work for less money, I pay them less money.\"\nAnd anyway, it's almost impossible to satisfy a Hollywood star: \"They\u2019re bottomless pits of need,\" she said. \"You\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\"\nWhat did Pascal learn from the hacks? \"You should always say exactly what you think directly to people all the time.\" Okay then.\n","Title":"Amy Pascal speaks about the Sony hacks, calls actors 'bottomless pits of need' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
