{"Main text":"36 Comments\nHalfway through the first episode of AMC\u2019s new drama Halt and Catch Fire, two characters reverse-engineer an IBM PC. Hardware whiz Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy, Argo) and his partner, a slick salesman named Joe McMillan (Pushing Daisies\u2019 Lee Pace) de-solder chips, check pin voltages, and transcribe memory locations, eventually ending up with the assembly-language code that makes the computer tick. It may not sound like compelling television unto itself, but like the meth cooks of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman it's a slick and riveting sequence in a pilot full of outstanding moments.  \u2014 and it could be setting up the network\u2019s most unlikely hit yet.\nSet in the heart of the Texas tech scene\n\"My dad moved my family down from Chicago, Illinois when I was about six weeks old in 1982,\" says writer and series co-creator Christopher Cantwell. We\u2019re in a post-production facility in Los Angeles, and Cantwell and his writing partner, Christopher Rogers, have taken a step away from the editing bays where they\u2019re overseeing the completion of the show. The duo met while working in social media marketing at Disney before joining forces to write \u2014 Halt and Catch Fire was the first project they actually sold \u2014 and within five minutes it\u2019s clear why their partnership works so well. Cantwell is the rapid-fire instigator, going off on conversational tears at a moment\u2019s notice, while Rogers is laid-back and thoughtful, speaking in measured bites.\n\"There was a lot of computer opportunity in Texas at the time,\" Cantwell continues. His father, he says, worked as a salesman at a software company in Dallas. It was a unique time for both Texas and the industry itself \u2014 ground zero for the PC-cloning revolution that upended IBM\u2019s dominance \u2014 yet the \"Silicon Prairie\" had never really been explored in film or television before. Given the dynamics and stakes, the duo seized upon it as the setting for their new show.\nA tense, ticking-bomb energy drives the story forward\nHalt takes place in 1983 at the fictional company Cardiff Electric. Joe McMillan is the mercurial sales guy, a former IBM employee intent on talking his way into Cardiff despite the company\u2019s modest size, while Gordon is a Cardiff engineer haunted by the failure of a computer he designed several years ago. Together they manipulate the Cardiff execs into helping them start a new business: creating and selling IBM PC clones. Rounding out the cast are Mackenzie Davis as Cameron Howe, a 22-year-old punk-rock programmer hired to bring the project to life, and character actor Toby Huss (potentially best known as The Wiz from Seinfeld ) as steely Cardiff VP John Bosworth.\nIt\u2019s niche subject matter to be sure, but the pilot for Halt has a tense, ticking-bomb energy that propels it forward, thanks to both the stylish flair of director Juan José Campanella and the exceptional cast. Lee Pace\u2019s Joe is a master manipulator, using Steve Jobs-style showmanship to hide the widening cracks in his own psyche, while Scoot McNairy brings even more nuance as Gordon. Rather than the easy stereotype of a geek engineer or heads-down builder, Gordon is a man that seemingly has the perfect family \u2014 though it does nothing to help him shake the angst he feels over his past failures.\nHalt and Catch Fire is a story about failed men and the opportunities they see to reimagine themselves \u2014 in this case, their canvas happens to be technology. It\u2019s thematic territory AMC has explored before with shows like Breaking Bad and Mad Men, and like those modern classics the key is honest writing and performances. The secret weapon, however, is Kerry Bishé as Gordon\u2019s wife Donna. It\u2019s a role that could have easily been turned into the caricature of the disenfranchised housewife, but Halt has higher aims. Donna is an engineer, juggling a job at Texas Instruments while caring for her two children, and doesn\u2019t push for Gordon to give up his dreams as much as challenge him to be engaged with his family at the same time. While it\u2019s unclear where the show intends to take the couple, the pilot establishes a complex dynamic with plenty of room to grow.\nHalt and Catch Fire is debuting the same night that Mike Judge\u2019s Silicon Valley finishes its first season, and while the shows couldn\u2019t be more different, Cantwell and Rogers do think we\u2019ve reached a cultural moment that is driving mainstream interest in all facets of technology. \"I think in the same way that the movie Wall Street was made as a cautionary tale about the wrong way to do business, I think there are people now that look at a movie like The Social Network and say, \u2018This is the new American dream,\u2019\" Rogers says. It also couldn\u2019t come at a better time for AMC, which lost Breaking Bad last year and just ended the first half of Mad Men\u2019s final season. While Better Call Saul is scheduled to debut later in 2014, there\u2019s a prestige drama gap in the network\u2019s schedule, and the Revolutionary War drama Turn isn\u2019t filling it just yet.\nHalt and Catch Fire may spring from the unlikeliest of subjects, but a high school teacher cooking meth hardly seemed like a zeitgeist-defining concept either. By using the backdrop of a technological revolution as a way to explore complex people and family dynamics \u2014 rather than the other way around \u2014 Halt keeps the focus on what makes the very best television come alive and thrive: the characters themselves. It\u2019s like Joe tells Gordon: \"The computer\u2019s not The Thing,\" he says. \"It\u2019s the thing that gets us to The Thing.\"\nHalt and Catch Fire premieres on AMC this Sunday, June 1st, at 10PM \/ 9PM CT. The pilot episode is available to stream online now .\n","Title":"\u2018Halt and Catch Fire\u2019 preview: AMC swaps meth for microchips | The Verge","Tags":["culture","preview","entertainment","tv-reviews"]}
