{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNew Yorkers and people across the United States have united for the third day in a row in dramatic protests following the failure of state prosecutors and a grand jury to charge a police officer for killing Eric Garner: an unarmed man suspected of selling loose cigarettes. People across the political spectrum have expressed confusion, disbelief, and sadness over the injustice, and many are asking how a police officer who was caught on camera choking a man to death in broad daylight could be let completely off the hook without a trial.  Garner's case is the latest in a long string of horrifying deaths at the hands of police.\nMany of the protests taking place across the country since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Missouri have resulted in disruption of public places; protesters have shut down roads and highways in dozens of cities as a form of civil disobedience.\nTonight, protesters staged one of the most symbolic displays in months. Starting at around 6:30PM, a rally formed  at Apple's flagship Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. Activists flooded the store and staged a \"die in\" for four and a half minutes.\nEric Garner protests day 3: #DieIn at #applestore , NYC pic.twitter.com\/5S7Qu4720p\n\u2014 Peter Fahrni (@peterfahrni) December 6, 2014\nThe images are compelling in their incongruity. Apple is renowned for its carefully managed brand image: its futuristic stores exemplify sleek ideas about a materialistic, affluent future. But tonight that image was taken over by the traumatic reality of life outside Apple's perfect glass cube. As Joshua Kopstein pointed out,  the contrast is striking .\nDozens staged a \"die-in\" at an Apple Store in NYC tonight. #BlackLivesMatter #Ferguson pic.twitter.com\/2nJGdyv0np http:\/\/t.co\/PDjGDSRfG6\n\u2014 Paradise Gray Xclan (@ParadiseGray) December 6, 2014\nProtestors in the Apple store. pic.twitter.com\/gITSncO6qg\n\u2014 Robert MacMillan (@bobbymacReports) December 5, 2014\nEarlier, #EricGarner protest took over Fifth Ave #Apple store.
