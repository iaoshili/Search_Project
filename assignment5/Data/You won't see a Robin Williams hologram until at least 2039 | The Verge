{"Main text":"You won't see a Robin Williams hologram until at least 2039\nLegal provisions stop the late comic appearing in adverts or films\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFrom Tupac's  performance as a hologram at Coachella to Audrey Hepburn's CGI  advert for Galaxy chocolate , it's become increasingly common for stars to make digital reappearances after they die. Some celebrities, however, are taking steps to prevent this posthumous exploitation, with recently uncovered documents showing Robin Williams to be among their number.\nno films, adverts, or holographic stand-up\nThe late comic left provisions restricting the use of his likeness for 25 years after his death, according to  The Hollywood Reporter. This means that there won't be any films, adverts, or holographic stand-up gigs featuring Williams' voice or image until at least August 11th, 2039. In life, of course, Williams happily appeared in a few adverts (including a  memorable spot for Nintendo alongside his daughter Zelda). But these canny legal restrictions ensure there will be no crass attempts to cash in on the goodwill he created in life.\n\"It's interesting that Williams restricted use for 25 years,\" Laura Zwicker, an attorney responsible for handling the estates of rich individuals, told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I haven't seen that before. I've seen restrictions on the types of uses \u2014 no Coke commercials for example \u2014 but not like this. It could be a privacy issue.\"\nVerge Video archive: How you can see performances by artists who are living, dead or completely made-up\n","Title":"You won't see a Robin Williams hologram until at least 2039 | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","us-world"]}
