{"Main text":"The Samsung Gear VR makes virtual reality easy, but I still feel dumb using it\nIn a world full of multitaskers, it's tough to cut yourself off\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVirtual reality is a difficult thing to review. It\u2019s hard not to be impressed when you look into a screen and see a world, magnified to surround you and responding to the motion of your head. It\u2019s even harder when the basic technology is so simple: almost every VR headset on the market is a mobile phone screen with some gyroscopic sensors and a pair of lenses. But when something like Samsung and Oculus\u2019 Gear VR comes out, you can\u2019t simply judge and recommend it like a phone or laptop. It\u2019s a $200 toy, plus an extra $700-800 for the phone it fits around, that promises to contain the embryo of a revolutionary new medium. So the real question isn\u2019t just whether you should buy it right now (because you shouldn\u2019t). It\u2019s whether there\u2019s a future in the ideas behind it.\nIt might be an early experiment, but the Gear VR successfully turns virtual reality into a plug-and-play affair, albeit one that involves a lot of hardware. The headset comes with a microSD card full of Oculus content that you\u2019re supposed to pop into the back of your Galaxy Note 4, the only phone that\u2019s compatible with the headset. Once that\u2019s done, you slide the Note onto a Micro USB connector that\u2019s set in a hinge on the headset, locking it into place. There\u2019s a transparent plastic screen that fits on top of it, but it seems purely aesthetic, and I usually ended up leaving the phone bare.\nIt\u2019s only after you\u2019ve connected that hardware that you\u2019ll be able to launch the Gear VR app, which boots automatically, although I had to install a firmware update to get it running. You can\u2019t actually set up the app in VR \u2014 you\u2019ll have to create a user account manually \u2014 but once you do, you\u2019re taken to Oculus\u2019 first attempt at a virtual reality interface, which evokes Steam Big Picture Mode or any home console. There\u2019s a library, a store, and a settings panel, where you can reorient the headset and turn on the Note\u2019s camera to see what\u2019s going on outside VR.\nIf you want, you can connect a Bluetooth controller; indeed, it\u2019s highly recommended, and some games won\u2019t work without it. The default method of interaction, though, is a trackpad on the right side of the headset, which can detect taps and swipes while you move your head to point. Using it makes you look like you\u2019re lost deep in thought, constantly massaging your right temple, and it doesn\u2019t always map intuitively to a game\u2019s controls. But short of a perfect solution, it\u2019s an ingenious substitute for moving a mouse or swiping a screen, at least until your arm starts getting tired.\nThe interface is smart, but you'll always look like you're thinking really hard\nThere are certainly enough hitches to remind you you\u2019re in an expensive beta program. The Gear VR app will show you notifications when someone texts or emails you, but they\u2019re just ugly gray boxes in the middle of the screen, and they\u2019ll also appear for superfluous, annoying things like app updates. VR doesn\u2019t usually seem to drain the Note\u2019s battery more than a high-end mobile game, but I managed to accidentally overheat it once during a half-hour session. The interface doesn\u2019t let you do anything much more sophisticated than select something and play it; there\u2019s no typing, no searching, and no interaction with the rest of your phone.\nMore importantly, there\u2019s not a lot to do in it. New content is added on a weekly basis (Temple Run came out for Gear VR last week, and  Samsung\u2019s Milk video service launched this week), but you still won\u2019t find more than a couple dozen apps. Developers can\u2019t charge for anything until 2015, so many have opted to include demos instead of full games. Apps like Oculus Cinema will let you play your own movie files in a VR environment, but for someone who\u2019s largely switched to Netflix or other streaming services, that\u2019s not much help. Samsung and Oculus explicitly discourage consumers from buying the Gear VR, and they\u2019re right to do so.\nOur September 2014 hands-on with the Gear VR.\nDespite this, the Gear VR is dramatically more user-friendly than almost any other VR system out there. Primarily, of course, I\u2019m referring to the Oculus Rift, which can be incredibly powerful and flexible but requires dedication and endless tinkering. But it\u2019s also got a leg up on other simple mobile headsets. Nicely balanced and padded, it\u2019s infinitely more ergonomic than Google Cardboard, with adjustable straps and a wheel you can turn to adjust the focus. While mobile headsets like the Zeiss VR One aren\u2019t limited to one model of phone, Samsung and Oculus have put a lot of work into creating a seamless experience, from the trackpad interface to the fact that you can see exactly how motion-sick a given game will likely make you. Despite its relatively empty catalog, it\u2019s far enough along to show us what using VR might look like in the future \u2014 for good or ill.\nOculus and Samsung have raved about the Gear VR\u2019s convenience and portability, but honestly, the most obvious strike against it is its size. The foam-and-plastic headset fits in my messenger bag, and I managed to take it to lunch with a friend, as well as on my Christmas vacation. But it\u2019s like toting around a large, ungainly pair of ski goggles with a fragile plastic cover. It doesn\u2019t feel self-contained, or like something that\u2019s meant to be carried by a normal human being. And unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to imagine it getting much smaller in the near future. Oculus\u2019 ultimate vision is to swap out goggles for something more like sunglasses, but any device like the Gear VR will have to support the weight of a fairly large phone, and all that padding takes up space.\nIn fact, mobile headsets seem caught between being a casual diversion and a dedicated console. The Gear VR\u2019s screen isn\u2019t high-resolution enough to act as a substitute computer, the interface is still limited, and long gaming sessions can make you nauseous. So its catalog favors short video \"experiences,\" arcade-style titles, and adaptations of mobile games, including Temple Run and castle defense title  Romans from Mars . It\u2019s the kind of content that\u2019s great for killing time on a commute, except that this is nearly impossible to do with a super-immersive and relatively bulky headset. Blindfolding yourself on the New York subway system is an automatic non-starter. I thought motion sickness and simulator sickness might cancel themselves out if I tried it in a car, but it just gave me a headache. On a crowded plane, I felt like a freak and an idiot, shutting out the world with an oversized pair of goggles and rhythmically tapping the side of my head.\nJust using a phone in front of someone can be considered a faux pas, and VR is so much more than that. Unlike most other headsets, the Gear VR will let you see through it \u2014 you can turn on the camera with a couple of button taps. But you\u2019re still giving the impression of being totally walled off, oblivious, and rude. I\u2019m surprised my brief forays outside haven\u2019t prompted a woeful New York Times op-ed.\n\"casual vr games\" are an oxymoron\nAlone at home, though, I found myself gravitating towards other media, including longer and more complex games that the simple Gear VR interface couldn\u2019t handle. More than anything, having a headset on hand made me realize how used I am to multitasking \u2014 and how entertaining I need something to be before I\u2019ll devote my entire attention span to it. I\u2019ll gladly spend hours playing puzzle games on my phone, but only if I can do it while watching TV or chatting with friends. Even with the pass-through camera option, it\u2019d be hard to watch a VR movie while making and eating dinner. No matter how much it adds to the film, if I have to pick between being truly immersed in a personal screening of Interstellar or being able to see my boyfriend while we\u2019re watching it together, I\u2019ll pick the boyfriend every time.\nWhile screen resolution and precise motion tracking is still an issue, we\u2019re past the era where VR has obvious, horrendous drawbacks, like a tubelike field of view, extreme lag, or an astronomical price tag. We\u2019re even starting to figure out what kind of experiences work for it \u2014 the Gear VR\u2019s small catalog is full of good ideas, from tours of our solar system to third-person action games that look like tiny dioramas.  Despite this, it\u2019s still not clear how we\u2019ll incorporate VR into the rest of our lives, or how Samsung and Oculus could make it a better fit. Price and size are obvious issues, but we\u2019re also going to have to decide what makes immersion really worth it. Complex puzzle games that require intense focus have justified that tradeoff for me; so have the incredibly creative landscapes some developers have built. But in the end, maybe we\u2019re just marking time until there\u2019s something so great it\u2019s unignorable. At least that way, if you\u2019re wearing goggles, people will know there\u2019s a good reason for it.\n","Title":"The Samsung Gear VR makes virtual reality easy, but I still feel dumb using it | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","review","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3631187"]}
