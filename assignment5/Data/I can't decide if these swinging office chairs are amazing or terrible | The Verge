{"Main text":"I can't decide if these swinging office chairs are amazing or terrible\nProbably terrible\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne complaint I have with The Verge's office set-up is, it doesn't feel enough like a playground. But these King Arthur Round Swing Tables,Â  designed by Duffy London , could change that. The eight- and 12-person tables are equipped with swinging chairs suspended from a steel canopy, which is perfect if your \"inner child\" has $16,000 to spare.\n\"As soon as people sit in it, they instantly open up, their posture changes, and they start smiling,\" designer Christopher Duffy told Fast Company . \"There's a different feeling when you're hanging from something than when you're sitting and you're supported from underneath.\"\nThat's true, there is a different feeling. It's a feeling usually associated with stomach-plunging roller coasters and bouncy chairs made for cradling fussy toddlers. But as I sit here, my body curled into a strange, trollish C-shape, that doesn't sound so bad. I can almost feel the breeze as I swing \u2014 quiet, calm, peaceful.\nIs this the worst idea ever, or the best idea ever?
