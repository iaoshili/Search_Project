{"Main text":"Google begins rolling out Android 5.1 update\nBug fixes, HD Voice, and a new anti-theft feature are bundled in\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe first major update to Android 5.0 Lollipop is here.Â  Google just announced that version 5.1 is rolling out now to supported devices including Motorola's Nexus 6 and HTC's Nexus 9. The software update \"improves stability and performance and offers a few new features like support for multiple SIM cards, Device Protection and high definition (HD) voice on compatible phones,\" Google said in a blog post. Lollipop was a major visual overhaul for Android, but didn't come without its own set of bugs and random glitches. Hopefully the 5.1 build also resolves some of the occasional sluggish performance Nexus 6 users have dealt with; that's been partially blamed on Google's decision to encrypt the device's storage out of the box, a move meant to deter thieves.\nSupport for multiple SIM cards is obviously important in Android One markets, and Google also confirms that this update will enable HD Voice for the Nexus 6 on T-Mobile and Verizon. (No, Verizon still hasn't gotten around to officially releasing the phone).\nDevice Protection is like Apple's Activation Lock, but for Android\nGoogle is also debuting its answer to Apple's Activation Lock. This is basically the same exact anti-theft idea applied to Android. It's intended to make your stolen phone basically useless to whoever took it. \"With Device Protection, your lost or stolen device will remain locked until you sign in with your Google account - even if someone resets your device to factory settings.\" Aside from the Nexus 6 and 9, Google says that Device Protection will be an available feature on \"most\" Android phones and tablets that ship with Android 5.1 from now onward.\nVerge Video Archives: Android 5.0 Lollipop Review\n","Title":"Google begins rolling out Android 5.1 update | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
