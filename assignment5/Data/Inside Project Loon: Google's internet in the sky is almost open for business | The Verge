{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\u201CGood news,\u201D says Katelin Jabbari, Google X\u2019s communications chief. \u201CIt\u2019s about to explode.\u201D\nWe\u2019re several hundred feet in the air, inching our way along a wooden walkway tucked high into the rafters of the massive hangar at Moffett Federal Airfield, where Google\u2019s most outlandish and secretive division has been testing new prototypes for Project Loon. Below us, a pair of huge balloons sway gently on their tethers. Engineers are racing around them like ants.\nLoon is being built with the audacious goal of beaming internet access down to the most remote parts of the planet, using specially equipped balloons that kiss the upper edges of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Today, the team is running an inflation test that will measure the pressure that the giant white spheres can handle before popping. The pressure hits 1000 pascal. \u201CIt usually doesn\u2019t last much longer,\u201D says Jabbari.\nThe ground crew radios up another report. \"We\u2019re at 1,100 now,\" she continues. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been this high without ripping before.\" A bulge emerges on the far side of the balloon, and several engineers scurry over with a mass spectrometer, searching for tiny ruptures in the fabric, invisible to the naked eye, that might be leaking. \"Okay, we\u2019re at 1,200; that is a new record,\" she says a few minutes later. \"I don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen now.\"\nThat's a good metaphor for Project Loon as a whole. As it moves past the technical hurdles of floating the internet miles above the planet, Loon is poised to enter uncharted territory: building an actual business.\nBalloons are now staying aloft for six months\nThis morning, in front of top mobile executives from around the world, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai laid out a renewed pitch for Project Loon. \"[It] started about four years ago as an experimental idea. When you think about it, it sounds a bit crazy,\" Pichai admitted. But they've made \"huge progress,\" he says, dramatically increasing their data speeds and coverage area. The early models last only a few days; the goal for commercial viability was to have them floating for three months. \"Today we are excited to announce most of our balloons stay up for as long as six months,\" says Pichai.\nThe newest record was a ballon that lasted 187 days in the air, circumnavigating the globe nine times, passing over more than a dozen countries on four continents along the way. As Google Glass undergoes a reset, and driverless cars remain years away from commercial viability, Loon looks increasingly like the poster child for bringing a disruptive new technology out of Google\u2019s labs and into the real world. After successful tests with several telcos, Loon is now in the process of working toward commercial deals with several network operators around the globe. \"We think the model is really beginning to work, and we have started large-scale testing,\" said Pichai. \"We\u2019ll be working with carrier partners around the world so they can build their services on top of our backbone.\"\nLoon project leader Mike Cassidy poses with the earliest payload prototype.\nLoon was born out of a long-standing fascination that Google\u2019s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had with high-altitude balloons. \"Either we could take something they hadn\u2019t thought about, present it to them, and get them excited,\" explains Google X chief Astro Teller, \"or we could take something they were already excited about, but no one really knew how to do and make it work.\"\nThe man tasked with \"making it work\" is Mike Cassidy, a serial entrepreneur with a nose for the next big thing. I met up with him in a crowded lab on Google\u2019s main campus, a 15-minute drive from the towering Moffett hangar where engineers were stressing Loon\u2019s translucent shells to their limits.\nA very particular set of skills\nOn his way to Google, Cassidy founded and sold four startups, including the search engine DirectHit, which AskJeeves bought for $532 million just 500 days after he launched it. Cassidy ended up at Google after it acquired his travel search startup, Ruba, in 2010. He spent some time working on Google\u2019s core search product, but in 2012, Teller came calling. He needed someone with entrepreneurial experience \u2014 but Cassidy also possessed a unique set of skills which had been dormant for a while.\n\"I actually got my bachelor's and master's from MIT in aerospace engineering,\" Cassidy explains. Before jumping into the software startup game, he \"designed communication satellites for a while,\" where he saw firsthand how painstakingly slow the development process could be. \"It would take three to four years to build a satellite and a year waiting for it to launch. If it was on station for 10 to 12 years, at some point, you\u2019re using technology that is five, seven, even 10 years old.\"\nAt Teller\u2019s Google X, things move a little faster. The initial step in any of the team\u2019s projects is simple, Cassidy explains: \"We try to prove that it can\u2019t work. So the first thing we did was take a router and flew it on a weather balloon up to 10 kilometers to see if we could still get a signal. That part worked.\"\nBetween March 2014 and January of this year, Loons set a series of duration records, topping out above 180 days.\nWhen you imagine a sensitive computer system that will be subjected to the harsh conditions of the stratosphere, you probably don\u2019t picture it inside a $2 box meant for a picnic. But in the fast and dirty ethos of X Labs, the simplest solution is often the best one \u2014 and so it was that the flight controller on early balloons was jammed into a styrofoam beer cooler and set to the edge of outer space. The team keeps that original unit around as a memento.\nSince then, the payload has evolved into a modular aluminum rig wrapped in a metal-mylar blanket that insulates it from temperature changes and high-intensity ultraviolet rays. It\u2019s suspended below two solar panels that collect all the energy used to power its onboard systems. The entire payload below the balloon looks very much like a miniature satellite, but takes a fraction of the time and money to produce. Google won\u2019t divulge the exact cost, except to say each balloon costs \"tens of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"Communication satellites are typically pretty expensive, hundreds of millions to build and a hundred million plus to launch,\" says Cassidy. \"Whereas the balloons are an order of magnitude or two cheaper to operate on a daily basis, even for a global network.\"\nLoon is always aiming to extend the lifespan of its flights, but in some ways, a short ride can be an advantage. \"With balloons you\u2019re only four to five months away from having a fresh balloon,\" Cassidy explains. \"New technologies come, new compression algorithms, the electronics can be updated, so you have a pretty fresh fleet in the air at any time.\"\nFrom right to left, the evolution of Loon's high-tech payload, starting with a styrofoam picnic cooler.\nGoogle isn\u2019t the only company born on the internet trying to make the transition to internet access provider: Facebook is charting a similar course, launching a number of initiatives (including drones) with the goal of flooding the world with internet service. That raises a troubling question: as the world's internet superpowers use their dominant positions to extend access to the developing world, will they be ensuring that people can reach the web, or just a white-listed portion of it? In India, Facebook's Internet.org partnership \u2014 which is often styled as an altruistic endeavor \u2014 doesn\u2019t include free access to Twitter, Google, or any other big name company that Facebook might view as a competitor. It\u2019s essentially the antithesis of net neutrality .\nCan the world's giant internet services be trusted to provide unfettered internet access?\nWhen I asked Cassidy if the internet enabled by Loon would be restricted in any way, or if Google would favor its own services, he seemed surprised by the question. \"I honestly don\u2019t know. No, it\u2019s the internet, whatever you get on the internet. It opens a Chrome browser and whatever you\u2019ve set as your homepage.\"\nTeller confirmed Loon\u2019s internet would be agnostic \u2014 you don't even have to use Chrome \u2014 and that it could still benefit Google in the process. \"We believe that there is plenty of goodness and plenty of financial benefit in the long run for Google,\" he told me. \"We don\u2019t need there to be some other goal.\"\nThe balloons ride global wind currents like rivers, climbing and sinking to find the right flow. ( EarthWindMap )\nYou can\u2019t just launch a bunch of balloons and connect the world, though: right now, Project Loon flies primarily over the southern hemisphere. That\u2019s partially a question of where its services are most needed. Compared to the northern hemisphere, the southern half of the planet is far less densely populated, full of remote areas where broadband internet is less likely to reach. These countries also provide a more welcoming regulatory atmosphere. \"The southern hemisphere is pretty easy to overfly in terms of air traffic control,\" says Johan Mathe, a Frenchman in charge of designing Loon\u2019s navigation. \"That\u2019s one of the places where there is the least hand off to do.\"\nEach loon is really two balloons in one\nMathe strolls up to a whiteboard inside of one of the innumerable windowless conference room that dot the Googleplex. To navigate, he explains, the Loons only move up and down, surfing through different altitudes to find wind currents that will carry them where they want to go. Each Loon is actually two balloons, one inside the other. The outer balloon is filled with helium that lifts it to its float altitude, while the inner balloon takes on air to descend or vents it to rise, like a boat using water as ballast.\nUsing massive data sets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Google\u2019s algorithms try to decide which currents they should ride to pass over coverage areas. It\u2019s a big data exercise that perfectly fits the company\u2019s core capabilities. Mathe draws a rainbow on the board, a vast array of possible trajectories that each balloon will take based on the wind.\n\"We only get 15 days of weather data, and after five or six days, the quality degrades. We cannot foresee the future very precisely,\" explains Mathe. The algorithms he crafts try to begin by hitting a broad target.  \"As we get closer, we kick in more frequent altitude changes.\" He shows a recent flight that launched from New Zealand, aiming to overfly a small town in Chile. It travels smoothly for a while, then begins to zigzag its way closer to the destination. \"We can observe this kind of tacking pattern, as sailors would do.\" The balloon passed within 500 meters (about 1,640 feet) of the village and successfully connected to a device on the ground.\nThe winds can be unpredictable\nThe flows aren\u2019t always that predictable. During a live demo in front of Brazil\u2019s minister of communications, a balloon drifted directly away from the village it was supposed to connect. Another one took out electricity to homes in a Washington town when it missed its landing site and came to rest on a power line. \"Usually when you fly in the southern hemisphere, you stay there. At least that\u2019s what we thought until we had a flight change hemispheres,\" says Mathe with a chuckle. \"We were like, \u2018What!\u2019 We thought that wasn\u2019t possible. So that was pretty fun.\"\nAs the balloons crisscross the globe, educating governments about what Loon is and how it works will be critical to the project\u2019s success. Countries like China, already outright hostile to Google\u2019s web services, may have little interest in allowing the search giant to beam internet access to its citizens, something that would make it difficult to reach a neighbor like India as well. That could put a huge swathe of the world's unconnected consumers out of Loon's reach. The company declined to comment on when and how it might start flying regularly over that part of the globe.\nBut even in developed nations with widespread internet access, there has been interest in what Loon\u2019s unique approach could provide. Cassidy recently traveled to a meeting with Japanese officials in Tokyo. \"One of the great benefits of being in the stratosphere is that it\u2019s above the weather,\" says Cassidy, when I ask him about the potential for flights over more of the developed world. \"If there is a hurricane or a typhoon that knocks out power or internet connectivity to people on the ground, the balloons provide very exciting ways to allow people to have immediate connectivity. As long as they have a battery powered phone in their pocket, people will be able to instantly get access to the balloon network.\"\n\"Floating cell towers in the sky.\"\nLast year, Project Loon switched its payloads from Wi-Fi to LTE \u2014 \"floating cell towers in the sky,\" Cassidy calls them \u2014 which led to big improvements in speed and reliability. For connectivity the balloons link up with base stations and pass signal between themselves like relay runners exchanging a baton. The move to LTE has also given a big boost to the business model, because it\u2019s now a turnkey solution for wireless network operators. \"The main reason the telcos are so excited about partnering with us is that they want to reach all the people in their country,\" says Cassidy. In fact, in many cases there is a government mandate for universal access \u2014 but building out wireline networks, cell towers, and fiber optics to remote rural regions isn\u2019t cost effective. \"Flying a balloon overhead, on the other hand, can be done very cheaply.\"\nThe team recently crossed another milestone with its first successful connection test across multiple continents. Balloons launched in New Zealand flew over 9,000 kilometers (about 5,600 miles) to Latin America and delivered an internet connection, then flew back around the globe for another successful connection test in Australia, navigating the balloons within 500 meters of their target locations at opposite ends of the world.\nGoogle wants to work with, not against, the incumbent telcos\nLoon has now conducted tests with Vodafone in New Zealand, Telstra in Australia, and Telefonica in Latin America, and it says it\u2019s working on commercial deals with several new network operators around the globe. These companies already own the spectrum and have the infrastructure in place to market, sell, and bill customers for service. Google gets permission to use the spectrum and provides the cell towers in the sky, sharing the revenue for each new customer with the telco.\n\"Sometimes people think of Google X as a research lab. But it\u2019s not just that,\" says Cassidy. \"Very early on in the project analysis it has to have a viable business model, and they are tough on the business model.\"\nAs Cassidy speaks, his voice rises with excitement, and you can recognize the former startup savant coming to the fore. \"Think about it \u2014 with 4.5 billion people without internet access, take 5 percent; you\u2019re talking 250 million people,\" he says. If those people pay just a small portion of their monthly income, say $5 a piece, \"you\u2019re going to be in a billion dollars a month in revenue, tens of billions a year in revenue. So it\u2019s good business, too.\"\nLoon's Pamela Desrochers inspects the inside of a popped balloon for damage.\nBack at Moffett, the sun is setting, casting long shadows through the enormous bay doors. High up in the rafters, I\u2019ve got my camera trained on the Loons below, hoping to catch the moment they explode. But I miss: with a silent slump, the balloon below me rents open and starts to crumple on itself. A small cheer goes up from the engineering team, who clamber inside through the tears to access the damage and see what they can improve for next time.\nIt's something that's never been asked of balloons before\nPamela Desrochers, a former fashion designer turned Loon program manager, is inside the carcass. She has obsessed over every detail of how to make the Loons last longer, from the materials to the special socks manufacturing workers now have to wear when walking on them. In this hangar, Loon staff are hyper-focused on finding better construction techniques, but it's clear that Loon is just a piece of a much grander puzzle \u2014 a puzzle that now involves balloons, satellites, fiber, and terrestrial wireless . Google, like Facebook, is looking to provide internet access so that its services can reach every corner of the globe, no matter how remote.\nDesrochers emerges from the tattered side of the slowly deflating balloon. She\u2019s been studying the way the fabric twists and folds to try and prevent the next pop. \"This is something that has never been asked of balloons before, to be reliable, to do what we ask them to do,\" she remarks. \"Before it was just a vehicle to gain knowledge. Now we\u2019re trying to make a business.\"\n","Title":"Inside Project Loon: Google's internet in the sky is almost open for business | The Verge","Tags":["google","business","tech"]}
