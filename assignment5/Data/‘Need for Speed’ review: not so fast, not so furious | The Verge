{"Main text":"108 Comments\nAs the lights go down in the theater, an \u201CEA\u201D logo flashes across the screen, which prompts a few errant chuckles from the moviegoers around me. I laugh too, and I\u2019m not exactly sure why. Maybe it\u2019s that it looks like a video game is booting up, or maybe we just all know movies adapted from video games are at a high risk of being absolutely terrible. Super Mario Bros. Street Fighter. Mortal Kombat. Doom. I could keep going.\nThis one is Need for Speed, a movie based on EA\u2019s long-running game franchise with just the thinnest of plot parameters to work with: there are fast cars, and there are cops. The fast cars are running from the cops. That\u2019s pretty much it. Presumably, everything else was fair game for screenwriter George Gatins, who shares a credit for the movie adaptation with his more broadly accomplished brother John (Real Steel, Flight).\nA boilerplate would-be blockbuster\nIn other words, the Gatins brothers were basically working with a clean slate. Alas, they still arrived on an elementary, age-old formula. It involves a down-on-his-luck kid, Tobey, played by Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul, with a talent for racing and a heart of gold. It has a bad guy (who\u2019s conveniently always wearing black clothes to remind you he\u2019s the bad guy), a love interest, and a final showdown involving \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a bunch of exotic cars. There\u2019s rarely a moment in the film\u2019s two hours and ten minutes when you can\u2019t roughly predict what\u2019s going to happen next.\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, of course. With a name like Need for Speed, moviegoers have a very good sense of what they\u2019re going to be getting for their money. And this formula has practically printed money for decades: if you made NFS animated, you\u2019d have a bizarro analog of the Pixar classic Cars. If you swapped cars for boxing gloves, you\u2019d have the rough outline of Rocky IV.\nIt\u2019s particularly true that you can lean on a tired plotline when you\u2019re appealing to gearhead culture; you certainly won\u2019t find any Oscars on the mantel for The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, but for all its silliness, it\u2019s endlessly entertaining. Unfortunately, it\u2019s that unavoidable comparison to the Fast & Furious series where NFS starts to look like the freshman effort that it is. Apart from Michael Keaton, who plays an eccentric millionaire operating an illegal street race, the only recognizable star from the film is Paul himself, and he hasn\u2019t yet shaken his image as Breaking Bad\u2019s rage-prone loser Jesse Pinkman. (Somehow I kept expecting him to slink off somewhere and smoke meth.) No doubt there are A-listers who have built an entire career playing more or less the same character \u2014 Bruce Willis, to name but one example \u2014 but Aaron Paul is a long way from Bruce Willis,.\nA surprisingly low-explosion affair\nStill, for what it tries to be, a movie like NFS can be saved by the action alone. You might think that a film filled to the brim with exotic cars and testosterone would beget an endless string of massive explosions, but NFS is a surprisingly low-explosion affair. Apart from a fiery Koenigsegg Agera flipping spectacularly off of a bridge, most of the action is limited to driving and the occasional crash. That may be due in part to the movie\u2019s budget, roughly a third of last year\u2019s Fast & Furious 6. Impressively, NFS involves essentially zero CGI and the actors did many of their own stunts. Aaron Paul took a crash course in stunt driving, and Scott Mescudi \u2014 better known by his stage name, Kid Cudi \u2014 actually learned to fly for the role, which involves spending most of the film piloting an aircraft or helicopter of some sort.\nBut that DIY attitude of the film\u2019s production comes out in places; I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the adrenaline-packed action sequences could\u2019ve been considerably more intense. Even a high-speed cliffside chase felt strangely brief and low-stakes. If this had been a Fast & Furious movie, the sequence would\u2019ve been three times longer, more people would\u2019ve died, and something \u2014 something \u2014 would\u2019ve exploded. A cargo plane, a battleship, a speedboat, I don\u2019t care. Something!\nNFS has turned out to be an odd pairing of a big-budget video game franchise to its mid-budget film adaptation, a dangerous equation that comes off feeling like an actual video game cutscene: lifeless, ill-conceived filler that gamers just want to skip through to get to the good parts.\nStill, despite the budget concessions, NFS can be rewarding for car lovers at times. It could\u2019ve easily gotten by with bog-standard supercars like the Lamborghini Aventador and Ferrari F12berlinetta, but the producers dug deep to arrange appearances by unicorns like the GTA Spano, the Saleen S7, and Lamborghini\u2019s glorious Sesto Elemento. Those appearances are brief, though: most of the movie focuses on Tobey\u2019s 900-horsepower Shelby Mustang, which is cool but not that cool. And, unwilling to be a merchant of death for any million-dollar exotics, crews built low-cost replicas of many of the cars for use in dicey scenes \u2014 I may have been psyching myself out, but I felt like I could tell when and where the cars were fakes.\nRare supercars aside, I left Need for Speed feeling\u2026 well, I wasn\u2019t really feeling much at all. I was never emotionally invested in the well-being of Tobey\u2019s crew the way I\u2019ve become invested in Dom\u2019s through his adventures with Brian O\u2019Conner and the motley Fast gang. I don\u2019t blame the producers for spinning such a thin thread connecting this film to the video game franchise that created it; they had practically nothing to work with, after all. But in the age of Fast & Furious 6, gratuitous car porn on the big screen only works when it\u2019s over the top in every sense of the word \u2014 and the people behind NFS appear to have had neither the money nor the imagination to pull it off.\nNeed for Speed is now playing in the UK. It opens in the US on March 14th.\n","Title":"\u2018Need for Speed\u2019 review: not so fast, not so furious | The Verge","Tags":["culture","review","movie-reviews","entertainment"]}
