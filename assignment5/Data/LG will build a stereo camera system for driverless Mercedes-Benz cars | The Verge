{"Main text":"LG will build a stereo camera system for driverless Mercedes-Benz cars\nNew partnership will see LG manufacturing key components for the autonomous Mercedes-Benz vehicles of the future\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe future of driving, it appears, won't require much driving at all. LG and Mercedes-Benz have this morning announced plans to co-develop a stereo camera system to be used in future autonomous vehicles. Using multiple cameras to detect what's in front of the car, and how far out in front, is the first step to giving it the self-awareness necessary to take the burden of driving away from the driver. It's also the first step in what both companies hope will be a productive and long-lasting partnership. In an emailed statement to The Verge, LG explains that it will be responsible for providing the \"core components\" of the driverless Mercedes-Benz cars of the future.\nSelf-driving cars are a major focus of research and development at present, with a mix of established tech and auto heavyweights \u2014 like  Google and  Audi \u2014 leading the charge. Now the two industries are coming together in what LG and Mercedes-Benz describe as a marriage of two globally recognized brands and an opportunity to \"create a masterpiece worthy of the luxury automobile.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
