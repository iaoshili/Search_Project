The news organization's team of  robot journalists will compile text based on game statistics provided by the NCAA. The move will expand AP's sports coverage to include Division I baseball, Division I women\u2019s basketball, Division II and III football, and Division II and III men\u2019s basketball.\n\"This will mean thousands of more stories on the AP wire, which will remain unmatched in the industry,\" Barry Bedlan, AP's deputy director of sports products said  in a statement . \"Every college sports town will have some level of coverage.\"\n\"Every college sports town will have some level of coverage.\"\nAP already uses this technology for some of its business reporting, which often involves wrangling large amounts of data into a clear and readable story. In January, AP used the robots to cover Apple's  record-breaking quarterly earnings . The technology, which was developed by the language generation platform  Automated Insights , is also used by Allstate, Comcast, and Yahoo.\nIn January,  AP told The Verge that no jobs had been lost due to the service. The newswire appears to see the technology as a means of filling gaps in its coverage rather than as a way to replace human reporters with robots. AP says it already creates  most of its \"sports agate\" \u2014 fine print usually used for charts and statistics \u2014 using automation. In 2013, the company introduced automated player rankings to its NFL coverage, which includes weekly text descriptions of player performances.\nThe rollout of the automated sports stories is expected to begin this spring and will continue over the next 20 months.\n","Title":"AP will use 'robot journalists' to expand its college sports coverage | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","tech"]}
