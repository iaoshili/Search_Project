{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt has been a glorious week for the internet. We were perplexed by the color of a (kind of tacky) dress, we got emotionally invested in a high-speed llama chase, a new season of House of Cards is on Netflix, and, most importantly, the FCC has officially voted in favor of Title II classification for the internet. Let\u2019s raise our glasses to Tom Wheeler with this playlist of tracks by supporters of net neutrality and songs that capture the tenacious spirit of the open internet.\nIf you\u2019re in a revolutionary mood, I suggest you start with \"Try Out Your Voice\" by Big D & the Kids Table. Revel along with Deniece Williams\u2019 \"Let\u2019s Hear It For the Boy,\" which I can only imagine was intended to laud Chairman Wheeler. Or maybe just take a cue from the FCC , and get funky with the Menahan Street Band.\nDeniece Williams - Let's Hear It for the Boy\nOK Go - The One Moment\nJunior Senior - Move Your Feet\nClap Your Hands Say Yeah - On This Tidal Wave of Your Blood\nGinuwine - Differences\nBig D & the Kids Table - Try Out Your Voice\nThao - Bag of Hammers\nThe New Pornographers - The Laws Have Changed\nMenahan Street Band - Montego Sunset\nMy Morning Jacket - One Big Holiday\nELO - Don\u2019t Bring Me Down\nSatchel Grande - Working Title Pt. 2\nKaty Perry - This is How We Do\nGeorge Michael - Careless Whisper\n","Title":"The Verge Playlist: Victory for the internet | The Verge","Tags":["culture","the-verge-playlist","entertainment","music\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3834807"]}
