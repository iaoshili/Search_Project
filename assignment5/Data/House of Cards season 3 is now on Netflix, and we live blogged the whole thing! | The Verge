{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix's flagship original series is back. After ( briefly ) appearing a couple weeks early, the third season of House of Cards is now officially available. That's 13 new episodes of the political drama starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright \u2014 and we're about to binge-watch the whole thing in one sitting.\nSimilar to the  season two live blog from last year, TC Sottek and I will be chronicling our thoughts and emotional well-being as we watch every minute of the new season from now until the credits roll on the final episode. This time, we're being extra cautious  about spoilers: each major spoiler-y update will be \"redacted\" until you hover or roll over the text to see. Try it for yourself:\nTest: I can't believe Frank did that omg!\nThink of this piece as a lighthearted compendium: you can read it whenever you start watching without worrying about scrolling too far down too early. (The pictures, we might add, bear no connection the adjacent episodes \u2014 these are just a random assortment of Netflix press images provided ahead of time.) Special thanks to Aidan Feay from our product team for helping us code this passive form of censorship.\nNote: Some RSS readers might not be hiding any text, and of course, a 0:13 timestamp means we had something to say at the 13-minutes mark, so still be careful as you scroll through!\nGot it? Good \u2014 let's begin!\nHere's my S3 finale prediction: Frank violates deep space treaty by sending a warship into the neutral zone, starts war with Klingons\n\u2014 T.C. Sottek (@chillmage) February 27, 2015\nMy House of Cards prediction: type 2 diabetes. 72g sugar per can. We've got at least 3 cans here c\/o @chillmage pic.twitter.com\/dvyTcdS4zk\n\u2014 Ross Miller (@ohnorosco) February 27, 2015\n1. Chapter 27\n0 hours, 0 minutes into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:00: Has Netflix ever had an opening sound before? Seems new to us. It's relatively minor, either way.\n0:03 Ross: It took all of 2 minutes for Frank to say hi to the audience. What was it, 45 minutes for the last premiere?\n0:04 TC: What if audience is mirror and Frank has been talking to himself this whole time, really makes u think\n0:05: Our first OH SHIT moment (Ross: \"just kidding, I watched the first episode when it leaked a couple weeks ago\")\n0:07: Okay, so maybe we don't need to use the spoiler tag for every single update.\n0:15 TC: Doug Stamper is using a Windows Phone, this must be the part where everything we're seeing is part of his coma.\n0:16: Claire: \"Any idea where she is, because it's important that we find her.\" Okay that's right, Doug got super creepy last season. (That one's spoiler-worthy.)\n0:21: Colbert! Must've been fun to be in the actual audience as the filmed a fake segment. A joke within a joke within a drama... Is this the most rigorous political interview Colbert has ever given?\n0:25 Ross: \"Definitely ramps up the oh-shit moments a lot faster than last year.\" TC: \"Episode one starts with Frank pissing on his father's grave, and then spends a ton of time just going through Doug Stamper's misery in the shadow of Frank's sins. Pretty clear this season will be about one thing: blowback.\"\n\u2014 OvO K (@ItsSpecial_K) February 27, 2015\n0:28: \"Petrov\" instead of \"Putin.\" Sure.\n0:33: Well-placed dick cover-up shot.\n0:45:\n0:47 TC: 47 MINUTES IN AND NOBODY IS GETTING SEX.\n0:50 Ross:This exchange underlines the situation so far pretty damn well... Frank: \"I will not be a placeholder President, Claire. I will win, and I leave a legacy.\" Claire: \"You mean we will.\"\n@chillmage @ohnorosco of course at least the two of you are awake and eating awful food at 4am because you\u2019re working\n\u2014 Tim Carmody (@tcarmody) February 27, 2015\n0:52 Ross: fuck fuck fuck fuck needles needles needles\n0:53 Ross: Eh, nevermind. I really don't get what just happened. It's not disturbing, it's just... weird?\nFinal thoughts from TC: \"Aww, Frank and Claire get along best when they kill people.\"\nFourth wall count: three this episode (although two were in quick succession, we're counting them separately)\nBonus: The Associated Press has a pretty good interview with Michael Kelly.\n2. Chapter 28\n1 hour, 6 minutes into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:04: Completely unrelated to what's happening on screen: TC brought beef jerky with him, and it's delicious.\nTime until the fourth wall is broken? Less than five minutes.\n0:09 Ross: All the celebration of last year? Gone. Honestly, it seems like Frank's miserable as president. Maybe he should listen to his entire political party and skip out on the actual election. Maybe instead retire to Vermont and make jam \u2014 y'know, like Scandal.\nTC: House of Cards keeps up with hip political realism. Looks like Frank will have to deal with a Supreme Court case about an American killed by a drone strike.\n0:19 Ross: Windows Phone! I'm not redacting that, y'all should be prepared for these moments.\n0:22 Ross: \"A kid who was on Facebook before his testicles descended\" is my new go-to descriptor for anyone younger than me.\n0:23 TC: Has Frank broken a lamp once in each season?\n0:25: With great power comes greatly diminished sexual prowess, apparently.\n0:31: Major spoiler: Claire (or maybe Frank) is gonna open up the egg in the season finale, and inside is one free ticket for the presidency.\n0:37: One of these days, Frank is gonna turn to speak to the camera but everyone in the room will hear his diabolical scheming.\n0:40: GRANOLA CEREAL... that's defiintely CG to cover up whatever actual cereal brand didn't want to associate itself with partisan politics.\n0:41 Ross: An all important reminder that Frank Underwood pronounces \"why\" with a harsh 'h' sound up front. (Also: I'm not counting this speech as breaking the fourth wall since he's talking to an actual camera, but it feels like it could be both.)\n0:42 TC: The set details are fantastic as ever. I used to do lobbying work in D.C. and I was pleasantly surprised in Season 1 when congressional offices actually looked like the real deal.\nThe set details are fantastic as ever\n0:47 TC: \"My desires are... unconventional.\" Audience: \"Show me.\" [Stamper squirts whiskey into mouth with syringe]\n0:51: This whole show feels like a native J Crew ad. J Crew, Windows Phone, and sterilized needles.\n0:52 TC: Claire Is Having Feels Alert. And now she's making eggs. (Update: slow zoom into eggs) Ross: Weird callback to her fertility struggles from past seasons? Eh, I'm probably stretching.\nFinal thoughts from Vox Product's Eden Rohatensky : Let's start with the end. Dat metaphor for Claire's baby-longing after the sudden gagging post-stress and boning, which might have hinted that she was pregnant, assuming she's not (post?) menopausal. (Good sentence Eden.) Also what are they doing with doug it makes no sense. Also that was the most awkward and strange sex scene i've seen since their threesome episode. Also i think that a hella lot of season 3 will be about claire, probably because post-presidency frank will be a little bit less interesting. Max they can have is 2 seasons of frank as president, so I think they're trying to set claire up for a more foreward-facing roll. Also Jackie is putting herself in a place that she'll likely be easily manipulated by Mr Kevin Spacey.\n3. Chapter 29\n2 hours, 1 minute into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:01: They may not call him \"Putin,\" but Pussy Riot still exists so... yeah.\n0:02: Everyone in this show is so thirsty, especially Doug, because he's only drinking five CCs of liquid at a time.\n0:13: Time until Frank breaks the fourth wall? About 12.5 minutes this episode.\n0:18 Ross: Also, this isn't actually happening. Not yet, at least. Anti-spoiler spoiler?\nclaire and frank and the russian president are having a threesome, wild upgrade from Meechum\n\u2014 T.C. Sottek (@chillmage) February 27, 2015\n0:25 Ross: Even in the world of House of Cards, everyone is obsessed with the 2016 election. Imagine, though: In the world where Underwood is president, nobody has the catchphrase \"Thanks, Obama.\" Does he still exist in this world? Did he just stay senator, perhaps?\n0:26 Ross: So... Petrov is part Bond villain? And he's also totally cool having dinner at the same table with Pussy Riot? And they're cool with it, too? Okay, I'm done with the questions.\n0:33: ...What?\n0:39: Here we go, Claire is setting herself up even at the expense of Frank (not that he hasn't \/ wouldn't \/ won't do the same. All it took was some gnarly, classy, White House beer pong.\nWest Wing in the streets, Scandal in the sheets, House of Cards when you're trying to keep The West Wing from knowing you slept with Scandal\n\u2014 T.C. Sottek (@chillmage) February 27, 2015\nFinal thoughts for Ross: Oh shit, that really was Pussy Riot. (As TC points out, that was already known \u2014 just not by me.)\nFourth wall count: two for this episode. I believe there were two last time, but I forgot to include that, so I'm gonna say seven moments so far this season.\n4. Chapter 30\n2 hours, 54 minutes into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:08: There's a lot of lazy background harmonica happening this season and it's giving off an if-Frank-Miller-directed-a-soap-opera sort of vibe.\n0:11 TC: There are a lot of different high-level political plots happening already. Unlike season 2, it's not really clear how they all relate to Frank or Claire's interests. It feels a lot more like a procedural this season.\nRoss: Reminds me a lot of the middle run of season one, when they actually had to get a bill passed.\nTC: Also this is just making me want another show like The West Wing without all the wacky murder plots but with House of Card's production quality.\n0:18: Our first sighting of Meechum, the Underwoods' residential unicorn!!!!\n0:21: First fourth wall of the episode \u2014 and he did it out loud. That, or one symptom of Alzheimer's is hearing meta commentary.\n0:23 TC (6:15AM ET): Oh god, the sun is coming up. ( Yep )\n0:27 TC: There's a lot of symmetry in this season, and a lot of pristine, beautiful things. It's like a Wes Anderson movie without dolly slides and Owen Wilson's face.\n0:28 Ross: Samsung alert!\n0:37: \"I've been out of the game for nine months... I wanna get back in.\" This is borderline creepy, the power-stumble-out-of-the-shadows. (Yeah, there's been a gap in our live blog. Chalk it up to some really good scenes and what TC said at the 23-minute mark.) I'm not sure I trust Doug changing signs, but then again, he has plenty of reason to abandon Frank. It's just hard to imagine him actually doing it. This feels devious.\n0:42 Ross: I just can't do it. I can't imagine Rawls from The Wire as a religious figure.\n0:44 TC: Frank Underwood just killed Jesus.\nRoss: Enter Meechum in a panic. gun drawn. Did Jesus try to attack you, sir?\nFourth wall count: just one this episode, for an estimated eight this season thus far.\nFinal thought from Frank Underwood: \"Well,  I got God's ear now.\"\n\u2014 eden rohatensky (@edenthecat) February 27, 2015\n5. Chapter 31\n3 hours, 46 minutes into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:03: No time wasted getting to our first fourth wall of the episode.\n0:05: \"You can't copmare unemployment to a Cat 4 hurricane.\"\n0:06: Celebrity journalist alert! Meredith Viera.\n0:10 TC: Okay, an election is definitely going to be a huge arc in this season. Or I could be completely wrong. But I'm not.\n0:11 Ross: All of a sudden he cares about money? This is definitely a ploy \u2014 but it's fun that they know it.\n0:15 TC: President Underwood is playing Monument Valley. I bet President Underwood reads The Verge .\n0:24 TC: Every episode this season Frank is having a Dr. House-style epiphany out of nowhere. The one in this episode was inspired by Monument Valley.\nRoss: Frank is really, really into Monument Vally. He just had his two closest confidants read a story on it. Probably The Verge.\n0:25 TC: Also I think I just saw a native Samsung ad that wasn't so subtle.\n0:28: Mansplaining alert! There's actually been a lot of mansplaining directed Claire's way this season.\n0:29: First fourth wall moment of the episode, both before and after Frank pretty much declares war on Congress.\n0:34: Smoking in the Oval Office. And now some making out. Cool Guy President.\n0:38: The lie he's referring to is likely when Claire said she aborted the rapist General's baby (when in fact she aborted Frank's kid during his campaign).\n0:41 TC: WOWWWWW: Claire Underwood just pulled the same move Bob Birch pulled in Season 1, giving Frank a peek at the D in the bathroom. Except Claire took a pee with the door open in front of the Russian ambassador. Power move. Also see: Jim Gaffigan's open door dump in Sex In The City.\n\"When Miranda left the door open for peeing, it opened the door for everything else.\"\n0:44: \"If you can convince me to be a silent princess with just 100 words, imagine how many millions you can convince with this book.\"\n0:50: It's a good thing Freddie missed being hit by that fridge on the highway. Now he can wait in one of Frank Underwood's depression lines!\nFinal thoughts: It's really about ethics in White House journalism.\nFourth wall moments: three (I'm counting before and after the talk in the oval office), for a total of 11 this season so far.\n6. Chapter 32\n4 hours, 44 minutes into marathon\nNote: All times listed below are relative to the episode. Hover or touch to reveal spoilers.\n0:03:\n@chillmage I just kept staring at the mouths thinking, \"it doesn't *quite* match but maybe that's just me.\"\n\u2014 Ross Miller (@ohnorosco) February 27, 2015\n0:09: TC: Some of the detail (like the Putin doppleganger) is trying so hard to look real that it backfires and stumbles into the uncanny valley. I mean, it's very slight. Maybe it's more like an uncanny pothole.\n0:17: Spoilers:\n","Title":"House of Cards season 3 is now on Netflix, and we live blogged the whole thing! | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
