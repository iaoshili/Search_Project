{"Main text":"Periscope, Twitter's answer to Meerkat-style live streaming, is now available\nAnd it's pretty great\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLive-streaming apps are the  thirstiest of all media. A Facebook post wants a like, a tweet begs for favs, and a snap means little without a response. But for sheer drop-everything, look-at-me arrogance, nothing beats the push notification that says \"LIVE NOW.\" I\u2019m doing literally anything, the notification says. Watch now, or you\u2019ll miss out forever.\nThe surprise emergence of Meerkat as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them. All that thirst, and it\u2019s totally unslaked. But even as the app began to be discovered by celebrities and other high-profile users, Twitter employees began shouting that a better solution was on the horizon:  Periscope , an app the company  acquired in January for a reported $100 million. Periscope, they said, was more than a way to stream yourself live: it\u2019s also a way to play those streams back.\nReplays are Periscope's killer feature\nAnd now we can see for ourselves. Periscope  arrives today on iPhone , with streams also viewable on the web. (An Android version is forthcoming.) Like Meerkat, it allows you to broadcast whatever you\u2019re doing \u2014 whether it\u2019s breaking news or making breakfast \u2014 live, through video, with a couple of taps. Unlike Meerkat, Periscope can save streams so that you can replay them later. It turns out to be Periscope\u2019s killer feature \u2014 and the main reason that it\u2019s likely to become my live-streaming platform of choice.\nFor everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks \u2014 which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail. You sign in with Twitter, and the first thing you see is a list of streams that are currently live. Below it, you\u2019ll see a list of recent streams. Not all can be played back \u2014 when you record yourself, you can stop your stream from being replayed with a single tap. But they save by default, and the result is an app that can actually be browsed.\nPeriscope is warm and fuzzy\nWhere Meerkat in its current incarnation is a bare-bones utility, Periscope is more warm and fuzzy. It introduces the world to the concept of infinite hearts \u2014 while you watch a stream, you tap to send the person recording it a heart. As soon as you tap, the heart appears on the screen for you and the rest of the audience to see. And you can tap as many times as you like \u2014 you can even double-tap to send two hearts simultaneously. It seems silly, but the multi-heart approach serves a purpose: they let the person recording know that their audience still appreciates what they\u2019re doing, even several minutes into a stream.\nThe result is that on popular streams \u2014 like that of retired astronaut Chris Hadfield, an early user \u2014 hearts fizz furiously in the corner of the screen throughout every broadcast, rising up like soda bubbles. \"It\u2019s like the crowd going wild \u2014 who doesn\u2019t like that?\" says Kayvon Beykpour, Periscope\u2019s co-founder. It\u2019s all part of an approach to make broadcasting less intimidating to the average person. \"We don\u2019t want this to be a tool for very few people,\" he says. Like a lot of people lately, Beykpour says broadcasting is finally a tool ready to be embraced by the masses.\nYou won\u2019t be able to launch Periscope directly from the Twitter app, at least not for a while. \"We don\u2019t think we need to start there,\" Beykpour says. \"We think this deserves to be a separate experience indefinitely.\" Still, there\u2019s a reason Twitter scooped up Periscope: Twitter is a mostly live experience, and so is its new broadcasting app. \"We always thought that what we were building, if successful, could be a real-time visual pulse of what\u2019s happening around the world,\" Beykpour says. The vision for Twitter is much the same.\nThe push notifications are out of control\nThe big problem with Periscope and its peer apps, as I see it, is that crazy thirst for engagement. Imagine getting a push notification each time every single person you follow on Twitter tweeted. That\u2019s Periscope in a nutshell \u2014 but instead of easily digestible tweets the notifications lead to livestreams, some of which are many minutes long. The result, at least for me, was turning off push notifications for Periscope as soon as I could. And I was following fewer than 50 people! I\u2019ll still use the app, but on my terms \u2014 and the team really ought to develop some more granular controls around notifications.\nOf course, that I can browse it on my terms is only thanks to the fact that Periscope thought to make its streams available for replays. I\u2019m not quite prepared to say the app is a Meerkat killer \u2014 Meerkat has been growing its user base at 30 percent a day, and it just announced a big new round of investment this morning. But for now at least, Periscope better matches the way that most of us actually use the internet. As of today, Meerkat has a lot of catching up to do.\nVerge Video: What is the future of communication?\n","Title":"Periscope, Twitter's answer to Meerkat-style live streaming, is now available | The Verge","Tags":["apps","report","tech"]}
