{"Main text":"Nintendo isn't giving up on consoles, promises to unveil a 'brand new concept' next year\nProject NX is the name of Nintendo's next dedicated game platform\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe big news from Nintendo today is all about the company's expansion into making smartphone games, but the company isn't abandoning its traditional business of building and selling gaming hardware. In fact, per the words of Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata, \"now that we have decided how we will make use of smart devices, we have come to hold an even stronger passion and vision for the dedicated video game system business.\"\nIwata says that Nintendo is currently developing \"a dedicated game platform with a brand-new concept,\" which goes under the internal codename of \"NX.\" He's leaving the details of what that concept involves deliberately ambiguous, but promises that Nintendo will divulge more on the subject next year. What's apparent from the Japanese company's statements today is that it sees itself as yet another ecosystem builder \u2014 like Google and Microsoft \u2014 where it uses smart mobile devices from others to funnel users to its own offering. \"For the consumers who are connected with Nintendo through smart devices and interested in Nintendo\u2019s IP,\" says Iwata, \"we would like to provide even more premium gameplay experiences on Nintendo\u2019s dedicated game platforms.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
