{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Wall Street Journal reports Apple is in talks with Comcast that could lead to the cable provider offering priority services for streamed entertainment for an  Apple set-top box . Sources say the cable provider \u2014 the US' largest \u2014 would offer Apple's traffic special treatment over the \"last mile\" of cabling between an exchange and customers' homes.\nThis potential deal would mean Apple's streaming service would be able to avoid congestion caused by typical internet traffic, but The Wall Street Journal's sources say the companies aren't yet close to an agreement. Comcast would have to invest heavily in technology to support Apple's desires, and both companies reportedly disagree on who would retain customer information, and whether Apple is given a share of Comcast's monthly customer subscription fees.\nComcast would give Apple's streaming traffic special treatment\nApple had  reportedly been in discussions with Time Warner Cable before that company \u2014 the second largest cable provider in the US \u2014 was acquired by Comcast for $45 billion, a purchase currently under review by regulators. Apple's apparent plans to secure the use of better network equipment isn't unprecedented for streaming service providers. In February,  Netflix and Comcast secured a deal that saw the former pay the latter an unspecified amount to use a more direct route through its network, a move that aimed to speed up Netflix's streaming capabilities.\nIf the reported talks come to fruition, Apple should be able to provide a faster and more stable service than their TV streaming peers. Despite his company's similar deal, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings  said last week that the essence of net neutrality was that providers such as Comcast didn't \"restrict, influence, or otherwise meddle with the choices consumers make.\" By offering preferential treatment to the most valuable company in the world, Comcast could be seen to be doing just that.\nUpdate: The Information has corroborated The Wall Street Journal's report, claiming that sources have provided details on the set-top box that Apple is planning.  As previously reported , the box is said to have a dramatically different interface from a traditional cable box \u2014 with on-demand menus replacing channel guides \u2014 and a particular focus on gaming. The Information says Apple wants iPhone and iPad game developers to make their releases compatible with the set-top box so users can play them through their TVs and use their iOS devices as controllers. As  Bloomberg reported in February , Apple's new box could launch by the end of 2014.\n","Title":"Apple and Comcast discussing TV service to bypass net congestion: WSJ | The Verge","Tags":["apple","entertainment","tech"]}
