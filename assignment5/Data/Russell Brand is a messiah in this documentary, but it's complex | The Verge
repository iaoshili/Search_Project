{"Main text":"Russell Brand is a messiah in this documentary, but it's complex\n'He\u2019s a very naughty boy.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvery so often, the people in Russell Brand's life will take time to tell you that he's a crazy person. That's the impression you get from director Ondi Timoner's latest documentary Brand: A Second Coming. \"He's mental\" is a frequent refrain throughout the film, as Timoner guides us through his early life to his drug-and-sex-addled rise to fame all the way to his more recent turn as a political commentator. But, as absurd as the proceedings can often become, Timoner\u2019s camera treats Brand with a kind of bemused awe, bordering on adoration. That it made its debut at South by Southwest is all too appropriate. Everyone here \u2014 brands and human beings alike \u2014 is trying to change the world in their own way. And it\u2019s clear that Timoner thinks Russell Brand probably could change the world, despite his many flaws. After all, crazier things have happened.\nHow can we take his call to action seriously?\nIn the process of making that point, Timoner also has to show that Brand is a cleaned-up addict. The camera never shies away from Brand\u2019s darkest moments \u2014 like freebasing crack cocaine or his divorce from Katy Perry. Those moments make some of his wild assertions about his revolutionary status seem outright bonkers. \"He\u2019s a very naughty boy,\" says BBC journalist Jeremy Paxman,Â  echoing Monty Python . It therefore makes some sense that Brand cancelled his appearance at SXSW . To many of his detractors, he\u2019s a self-obsessed man-child, as addicted to fame as he was to any drug he\u2019s done. And he\u2019s rich besides. How can we take his call to action seriously?\nAs the title makes abundantly clear, Brand fancies himself a modern-day Christ figure. And he really means it, earnestly, without a hint of irony, and in a way that makes you recoil before he manages to draw you in. In his 2013 comedy special Messiah Complex, he claims he\u2019s \"a little bit like Jesus,\" the kind of man who can shake the world by force of personality and truth \u2014 after he makes a dick joke, of course.\nArchival footage Timoner employs reveals Brand in his younger days as being addicted to attention, but having an almost preternatural charisma to match his hyper-smart mouth and penchant for over-the-top antics. That addiction propelled him to stardom, as he effectively willed himself into pop culture consciousness by being as outrageous as possible. But after getting disillusioned by Hollywood excess, he turned his attentions to \"changing consciousness\" by fighting for the disenfranchised and calling for the wholesale overthrow of the global socioeconomic order.\nHe effectively willed himself into pop culture consciousness by being as outrageous as possible\nTimoner uses the absurdity of Brand\u2019s egomania as an often hilarious counterpoint to what she clearly perceives as the actor\u2019s sincere desire to do good in the world. At one point in the film, Brand finds himself talking about forsaking his worldly possessions with Mike Tyson, but the conversation quickly devolves into how Tyson loves Brand\u2019s shoes. You get the sense that, while he probably never gave up the shoes, he would like to be applauded for at least thinking deeply about it. Indeed, Brand is rich many times over, but these days spends his time agitating for economic change and the distribution of wealth. And he has developed a sizeable following in the process, since what he says resonates with those hit hardest by the recent economic downturn.\nThe back half of the film explores his political activities at length. Brand has gone viral over and over again for commenting on the more dunderheaded aspects of news media, and perhaps rightfully so. When it comes to economic theory and drug addiction, he seems to know his stuff, or at least more than the average talking head on television. There is truth in the idea that change needs to come. But when talking about what comes next after the inevitable revolution he preaches about, things tend to quickly descend into pablum about higher consciousness and community. Timoner says that she hasn\u2019t drunk the Kool-Aid, but she isn\u2019t especially hard on him in the film either. Presumably because, as the film seems to express, it\u2019s enough to break down the door in order to let others through.\nThe idea for Brand: A Second Coming came about seven years ago, and several directors passed through the production since. Timoner\u2019s take in the final product is a simultaneously uncompromising and fawning in its depiction of Brand, where his ridiculousness only serves to prove the point that one man, even Mr. Katy Perry himself, can make a difference. Here, we see plainly that Brand is every bit as intelligent as his opponents, even if his message isn\u2019t entirely coherent.\nThe film is Brand Agnostic\nShe stops short of saying he\u2019s the Messiah, but you might say she\u2019s Brand Agnostic. He\u2019s good at what he does, and she\u2019ll have you believe he might have the makings of a leader in him. But should the revolution actually come, don\u2019t be too quick to follow Russell Brand into the breach.\n","Title":"Russell Brand is a messiah in this documentary, but it's complex | The Verge","Tags":["culture","movie-reviews","entertainment","film\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7979488"]}
