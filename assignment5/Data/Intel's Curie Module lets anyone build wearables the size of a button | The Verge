{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIntel spent most of 2014 shifting its focus to wearables by buying fitness band company Basis Science and creating partnerships with fashion companies . But CEO Brian Krzanich just announced a major extension of that focus at the company's CES keynote presentation with the Intel Curie Module. It's a low-power hardware module that could be used to build wearables out of things like rings, bags, pendants, or glasses.\nThe module uses a new version of Intel's Quark chip \u2014 the Quark SE \u2014 to enable such compact wearable technologies. It's capable of being integrated into such small form factors that Krzanich even showed it off in a coat button on stage. Curie uses Bluetooth LE and includes a low-power sensor hub, a pattern-matching accelerator that allows for accurate gesture recognition, and a six-axis combination accelerometer and gyroscope, all crucial ingredients for making compact wearables. On top of all that Curie runs Viper, an open-source software that can take the information gathered by those internals and use it for things like activity recognition or step tracking.\nIntel did most of the work for you\nThe hope is that companies use Curie to bypass difficult developmental steps like designing circuitboards or tweaking Bluetooth radios, according to Mike Bell, VP and GM of Intel's New Devices Group. As he told me a few hours before the press conference, \"[Curie] essentially gets you pretty far along towards a product, you really just have to add your secret sauce on top of this and you\u2019d have a pretty great wearable product.\"\nBell used the breadth of creative ideas being spawned by the company's Edison platform \u2014 the more broadly-focused predecessor to Curie \u2014 as a reference point for why he believes Curie is important. \"We saw all these people had all these great ideas, but the barrier to entry to this stuff is pretty high because the technology is very small and very integrated.\"\nThe Intel Curie Module will be available in the second half of 2015.\n","Title":"Intel's Curie Module lets anyone build wearables the size of a button | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
