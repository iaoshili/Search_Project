{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe world has forgiven Howard the Duck. What started as a bizarre 1973 tale of a grumpy anthropomorphic drake surviving in an otherwise normal human world eventually became one of the biggest bombs in film history. Howard's appeared here or there since then, including a limited run in 2007. But then he took center stage this past summer  in Guardians of the Galaxy's bizarre post-credits scene \u2014 a move that Marvel has consistently used as a platform to promote something \u2014 and now we know why.\nthank you all for your kind words i can practically taste your future disappointment mmm tasty\n\u2014 Chip ZdarborDay (@zdarsky) November 21, 2014\nMarvel is bringing Howard the Duck back in a comic book series launching this March by Chip Zdarsky (Sex Criminals) and artist Joe Quinones. Howard will be a duck from space. \"He's an everyman who happens to be a duck!\" explains Zdarsky in an interview  with Entertainment Weekly . \"He's angry, exasperated, and he's had it up to here with the world around him, but he's trapped here! Infinitely relatable!\"\nNo word on a movie yet, but give it time \u2014 a lot of time, perhaps. The world has forgiven,  but it hasn't forgotten . Hey look, there's a baby Groot on his filing cabinet!\n","Title":"Howard the Duck has officially made a comeback | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
