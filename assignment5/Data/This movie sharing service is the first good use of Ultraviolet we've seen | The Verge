{"Main text":"This movie sharing service is the first good use of Ultraviolet we've seen\nBut it might not last long\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFormer Wall Street analyst Steve Wang has just launched  Wavelength , a free movie-sharing service, or, as Wang is  calling it, \"the first social movie service.\"\nWavelength is powered by  Ultraviolet , a cloud locker created by movie studios in 2010 that allows users to buy one copy of a movie and stream it to multiple devices. Users can post a listing of all the movies they have in their Ultraviolet libraries to Wavelength, allowing their friends to browse and watch. Instead of hosting the movies, Wavelength sends users to an online portal run by the film's original retailer, like Walmart's  Vudu or  Flixster . Up to three people can watch the same movie posted by a shared friend.\nStream your friends' movies\nBy working with Ultraviolet, Wang has managed to play by Hollywood's rules without actually having the support of Hollywood. But if he wants Hollywood to invest in his service, he'll have to prove that Wavelength can actually get people to buy movies instead of just streaming them.\nThe whole thing is a delicate ecosystem.  According to Recode , Wang is worried that Ultraviolet will soon rewrite its terms of service to prevent multiple users from sharing the same library, which could prevent new users from streaming their friends' videos.\nIn a  blog post about the launch , Wang said, \"It's unclear if we will be able to ultimately fulfill our longterm vision.\" But they're pushing on anyway. Ultraviolet's benefit to the consumer has never been clear. With Wavelength, it's just a little bit clearer.\n","Title":"This movie sharing service is the first good use of Ultraviolet we've seen | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
