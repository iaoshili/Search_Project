{"Main text":"Spectacular food packaging decays with its contents\nTomorrow Machine's 'This Too Shall Pass' series is designed to have a short lifespan\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSwedish design studio  Tomorrow Machine believes that the relationship between food and packaging should be symbiotic, with containers surviving only as long as their contents. In a vividly colored series entitled \"This Too Shall Pass,\" the company showcases three items, each of which looks more like an ornament than a household product.\nThe first is a gelatinous packet molded from agar-agar and water that is intended for use with liquids like cream, smoothies, and fresh juice. The second is a triangular-shaped package designed to house dry goods such as rice or grain. Made from beeswax, it is adorned with a subtle gradient and must be peeled like a fruit in order to access whatever is inside. The third is arguably the most spectacular, an iridescent jade snowglobe built out of wax-coated, caramelized sugar. A crack is all it takes to release the water-soluble package's cargo. \"This Too Shall Pass\" is just one of  Tomorrow Machine's varied attempts to imagine an environmentally friendly yet appealing future.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
