{"Main text":"An unlikely hack lands Edward Snowden in the White House\nGoogle Maps lists 'Edwards Snow Den' shop at home of the president\nAfter turning up as  a sculpture in Brooklyn Park and making an  appearance on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , Edward Snowden has finally returned home. In fact, if you look at Google Maps right now, it appears he's marched  all the way to the president's office , presumably to find out  exactly who has copies of his dick pics .\nIn its mobile app and on desktop, Google is showing a business listing for a fake shop named \"Edwards Snow Den\" slap bang in the middle of The White House. Could this be the search giant's way of suggesting a rapprochement between the US administration and the famed whistle blower? Unfortunately not: the out-of-place Snow Den is simply the result of someone changing the location of a verified business listing after it's gone live on Google Maps.\nA screenshot from Google Maps showing \"Edwards Snow Den\" and \"cCross law firm\" in the White House. ( Google Maps )\nThe search giant  confirmed as much to Marketing Land , who first reported the goof, and added that Google had removed the listing. However, when we scooted over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to take a look for ourselves, we found Edwards Snow Den (a snowboarding shop, according to its  Google Plus page ) still open for business. However, while Marketing Land reported that it was a verified business, this no longer seems to be the case, suggesting that Google is working hard on deleting Snowden from the White House.\nThis sort of location squatting seems to be a bit of a problem for Google Maps. In addition to the Edward Snowden shop, there is also one \" cCross law firm \" that's listed as located in the West Wing. And a couple of hundred meters to the east, the US Department of the Treasury is showing that it's home to \" freddy frazbear's pizza \" \u2014 a typoed version of  Freddy Fazbear's Pizza , the fictional setting of indie horror game Five Nights at Freddy's.\n","Title":"An unlikely hack lands Edward Snowden in the White House | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
