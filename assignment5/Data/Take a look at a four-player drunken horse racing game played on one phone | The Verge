His latest game is available on the significantly larger Android and iOS platforms, and allows up to four players to play at once.\nPerfect for endless car rides with the family\nFinger Derpy appears to play, as my pal Josh Lowensohn describes it, like \"Hungry Hungry Hippos from hell.\" Each player controls the left and right side of a horse by tapping the screen. With four people tapping two fingers each on one mobile device, chaos is all but guaranteed. It's a sweet premise, and the local multiplayer function could help pass the torturous long-distance car rides that await this summer vacation.\nFinger Derpy launches this April. Until then, please feel free to enjoy the lyrics to Mr. Ed. May they be stuck in your brain as they are in mine.\nA horse is a horse, of course, of course, \nAnd no one can talk to a horse of course \nThat is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Ed.\nGo right to the source and ask the horse \nHe'll give you the answer that you'll endorse. \nHe's always on a steady course. \nTalk to Mr. Ed.\nPeople yakkity yak a streak and waste your time of day \nBut Mister Ed will never speak unless he has something to say.\nA horse is a horse, of course, of course, \nAnd this one'll talk 'til his voice is hoarse. \nYou never heard of a talking horse?\nWell listen to this.\n","Title":"Take a look at a four-player drunken horse racing game played on one phone | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
