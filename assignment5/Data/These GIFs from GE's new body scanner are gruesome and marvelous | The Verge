{"Main text":"These GIFs from GE's new body scanner are gruesome and marvelous\nHell yeah, science\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you haven't personally had to lay down and slide into a CT scanner, you've probably seen one on television. They're super X-ray machines that put image \"slices\" together from head to toe to create a 3D representation that lets doctors see detail inside your body. And General Electric's new machine is incredible.\nIn a blog post about its Revolution CT, introduced in 2013, GE has posted a bunch of GIFs and images that show its scanner in action. Doctors are apparently happy with the new device, first introduced for real-world use last September, as it's designed to emit less radiation and provide more comfort for patients.\nThe results of the new CT machine are haunting, gruesome, and marvelous.
