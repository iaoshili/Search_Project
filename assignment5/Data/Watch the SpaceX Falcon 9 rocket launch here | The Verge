{"Main text":"Watch the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch here\nLiftoff is at 10:50 PM ET\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nElon Musk's SpaceX team is scheduled to launch its Falcon 9 rocket again tonight. If all goes as planned, the 14-story tall rocket will launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral Complex 40 launch pad at 10:50 PM ET.\nAfter it launches, the Falcon 9 will jettison two commercial satellites into space: one from the French satellite provider Eutelsat and one from Asia Broadcast Satellite. The all-electric satellites should reach a final operating post of 23,000 miles above the equator. The livestream, which you can watch above, is scheduled to begin at 10:30 PM ET.\nLast month, SpaceX was forced to postpone  a Falcon 9 launch several times before finally succeeding . For that launch, the company scrapped its initial plan to land the rocket on a floating barge in the Atlantic. SpaceX first attempted to land the Falcon 9 on the 300-by-100-foot barge back in January, but the rocket exploded on impact . If the barge landing had been successful, it would have meant SpaceX could recycle the Falcon 9 rocket. Tonight's launch will end with a \"soft landing,\" in which the rocket lands in the ocean and will most likely not be recovered.\nIf the launch fails, the team will try again on Monday night.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
