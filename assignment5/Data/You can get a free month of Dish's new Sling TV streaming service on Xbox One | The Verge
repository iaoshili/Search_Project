{"Main text":"You can get a free month of Dish's new Sling TV streaming service on Xbox One\nAvailable in the \"coming weeks\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDish just announced Sling TV,Â  its bold new experiment in internet TV that gives cord cutters access to big names like ESPN and Adult Swim without a cable subscription. If you're not quite sold on the idea, though, there's a month-long free trial coming up \u2014 but only for Xbox One owners. Microsoft partnered with Dish to bring the extended trial to the console \u2014 which is also the only games console that will support the new service at launch \u2014 and says it will be available to Xbox Live members in the \"coming weeks.\" The service will regularly cost $20 a month when it launches, and you can add bundles of premium content like \"kids\" or \"news\" for an extra $5 each. Sling TV is expected to launch later this month on devices including Amazon's Fire TV and Roku's set-top boxes.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
