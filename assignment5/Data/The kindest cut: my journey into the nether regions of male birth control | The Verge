I wince, and he says, \u201CI can assure you, it doesn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201D From there, he explains, it\u2019s a simple process to extract and sever my vas deferens, the tiny tubes that carry my seed. Just to be safe, he\u2019ll cauterize the cut ends before tying them back together, burning my baby-making apparatus into oblivion.\nI\u2019m in the office of Dr. Robert Nejat, getting a final consultation before I schedule my vasectomy. My second son was just born; my wife and and I decided that was all we could handle, logistically and financially. She doesn\u2019t respond well to the hormones in The Pill, and the thought of going back to condoms was abhorrent to both of us. So I decided to take the plunge and sterilize myself.\nBurning my baby-making apparatus into oblivion\nVasectomy seemed appealing for a few reasons. From what I read before I made my appointment, vasectomy was a relatively simple outpatient procedure, wouldn\u2019t affect my sex life, and could be reversed if a few years from now we won the lottery and could afford another child. So I was a little startled when Dr. Nejat declared in no uncertain terms that the procedure would be \"permanent.\"\n\"I thought vasectomies were reversible,\" I half-whispered, still prostrate on the examining table. He looked at me with the tired resignation of a combat officer talking to greenhorn recruit. \"Some doctors might say they can do that for you,\" Nejat told me. \"But I won\u2019t.\"\nI couldn\u2019t extinguish the tiny sliver of hope\nAnd that, ultimately, was the hardest part of a vasectomy for me. I was being told to consider it an inalterable decision. But I couldn\u2019t extinguish the tiny sliver of hope that if someday I wanted, or needed, to reverse the process, there would be a doctor who could work that miracle for me. Technically, all the essential parts work just like before. \"You\u2019re still making semen,\" Nejat explained. \"We\u2019re just closing the door.\"\nThere was no turning back now, I thought. My wife and I had talked it out. I loved the family I had, and this would be for the best. I told him that I was ready to proceed, pulled up my pants, and shook his hand. At the front desk his assistant booked me for the third week in November. It was a done deal.\nBut as I walked out to the parking lot, I was thinking that I had one month until the procedure, plenty of time to come up with a less drastic alternative. I pulled onto the highway, a phantom puncture in my left testicle nudging me with a dull, aching pain, determined to find a better way.\nPaupers, perverts, and old men - a brief history of vasectomy\nIn 1830 Sir Astley Cooper, a prominent British surgeon, discovered that when he severed the vas deferens of a dog, it could still have sex but no longer reproduced \u2014 even though a later autopsy revealed the dog had continued to produce sperm. Astley was principally concerned with treating disease of the testis, and never followed up on this discovery. But his work was widely read by other doctors, and was the beginning of vasectomy\u2019s development. Until that time, the primary means of sterilizing males was castration.\nThroughout the 1800s several surgeons followed Cooper\u2019s work with experiments on the vas deferens of rabbits, pigs, and rats. The results were mixed; many believed that the technique led to degeneration of the testicles. The practice didn\u2019t become standard until 1890, when Harry Sharp, a doctor working at a penal colony in Jefferson, Indiana, began performing vasectomies on human subjects.\nAccording to Sharp, a 19-year-old boy came to him with a complaint: the young man suffered from excessive masturbation and requested that Sharp perform a castration. Sharp suggested they try a vasectomy instead. Six months later, according to the doctor, the patient reported that he felt in good health and was no longer overwhelmed by his sexual urges. Sharp was emboldened by this success to try the technique on others.\nImage courtesy in.gov\nExcept the vasectomies that followed weren\u2019t as benign. In 1907, Sharp helped to get the first US eugenics law on the books in his state, and began pushing for the spread of vasectomy as a means of sterilizing \"undesirable\" elements of society. The movement dovetailed with the more virulent strains of racism and nativism prevalent in the United States at the time. It also tacked on ideas form Sir Francis Galton, the cousin of Charles Darwin, who twisted evolutionary theory to argue humanity should breed out inferior races. During the early part of the 20th century eugenics was a mainstream movement, backed by industrial giants like the Carnegie Institution and Rockefeller Foundation, and supported by scientific heavyweights like Alexander Graham Bell and the biologist Charles Davenport.\nThe relatively non-invasive nature of vasectomy made it a powerful tool for eugenics advocates. In an essay entitled \"The Surgical Treatment of Habitual Criminals, Imbeciles, Perverts, Paupers, Morons, Epileptics, and Degenerates,\" Dr. Albert Ochsner wrote, \"This operation causes absolutely no pain and no deformity, does not endanger the life of the patient and does not in any way interfere with his sexual life with the one exception that it prevents reproduction.\" Unlike castration, he argued, \"It does not contain the element of punishment and can therefore be applied to the other non-criminal classes.\" According to Cabinet Magazine, \"By 1937, thirty-two states were performing eugenic sterilizations on criminals, the unfit, and the insane.\"\nImage of a dog before and after vasectomy from Steinach's book, Sex and Life\nOver in Europe, vasectomies were also becoming increasingly common, but for precisely the opposite reason. A Viennese scientist named Eugen Steinach began advertising vasectomies not for sterilization, but to reverse the process of aging, something he called rejuvenation. Steinach\u2019s technique severed only one of the two vas deferens, something he believed worked to balance the procreative fluids and restore youth. One tube remained intact so the patient could still reproduce. It became so popular that people talked about being \"Steinached\", with big names of the era like Sigmund Freud and W.B. Yeats going under the knife. Yeats claimed that the procedure was like a \"second puberty\", reviving his sexual desires and creative power.\nVasectomy was now thought of as both a sterilization and fertility treatment. This duality culminated in the Nazi period: Hundreds of thousands of older German men received the Steinach treatment, something the Third Reich advocated to help extend  breeding period of what they considered the master race. Meanwhile, the Nazis used full vasectomies to forcibly sterilize an equally large number of patients. By the end of the war,Â  Steinach\u2019s treatment was debunked and fell out of favor. The atrocities of the Nazi period tainted the eugenics movement in America. Vasectomies for criminals and the mentally ill became increasingly less common over the decades that followed.\nA hands-on review\n\"I can\u2019t recommend it enough,\" said my chiropractor, snapping my head to the left with a loud, rolling crack in my neck. \"My vasectomy has really done wonders for my sex life, and just kept my wife and me feeling very secure.\"\nWith a few weeks to go until it\u2019s my turn, I\u2019m asking most everyone I know for their advice, hoping someone will talk me out of it or suggest an alternative I haven\u2019t discovered. So far, no luck.\n\"The thing you have to be careful about is getting too confident,\" he explains. The vasectomy will take some time to heal. He pauses, searching for a metaphor I\u2019ll relate to as a tech journalist. \"It\u2019s like having a new gadget you just can\u2019t wait to try.\"\nHis procedure was simple and painless, says my chiropractor. He walked out of the office and took the subway home. A week later, the recovery seemed to be going great. Or at least, it was, until he decided to test his equipment. \"Everything seemed normal and then right when I got to the top, BOOM.\" He remembers curling up into a fetal position while his wife looked on in shock. \"Some of the worst pain I\u2019ve had in my life. I actually threw up a little, it was so bad.\"\nWhat followed was several days of swollen, purple misery. \"A vasectomy is a wonderful thing but trust me, you should wait as long as they tell you\" to have sex, he said. \"Probably more.\"\nIs there an impulse-buy market? (via kevjblack\/Flickr )\nWhy men lack options\nGiven the massive market for contraception, why is there no medicine for men equivalent to the birth control pill for women? It seems like married men with means would be happy to pay a monthly fee for some kind of contraceptive drug. Drugs like Pfizer's Viagra and Eli Lilly's Cialis were multibillion dollar boons for the pharmaceutical industry, after all. I evaluated my non-surgical options; it turns out that there are actually a lot of possibilities currently being investigated. The problem is, it\u2019s not clear if any will ever come to market.\nResearchers now at Oxford University have invented the so called \"clean sheets\" pill , which relaxes the muscles around the vas deferens so that, well, nothing comes out. A man taking the pill can have sex and orgasm as normal, but the sheets, and everything else, stay semen-free. Not only does the lack of fluid help lower the risk of pregnancy, it may help prevent the spread of diseases like HIV as well.\nMen's reproductive health is far less well-understood than women's\nIn India, researchers are working on RISUG , a technique in which a special polymer is injected into the vas deferens, where it works to chemically neutralize sperm as they flow by. This has the upside of requiring less severe surgery than a modern vasectomy and, at least in test on rats and primates, of being more reliably reversible. Inspired by the Indian work, a US group called the Parsemus Foundation is developing something similar, dubbed Vasalgel, in San Francisco.\nHormone treatments such as androgen and progestin have proved effective as temporary sterility treatments, but the side effects \u2014 a loss of sex drive and reduced muscle tone  \u2014 have made them commercially inviable.\nA number of different non-hormonal drugs  \u2014 Gamendazole , Adjudin , JQ1 \u2014 work to inhibit the production of sperm or to render the sperm useless. All three are currently in human trials, but like RISUG and Vasalgel, have have been frustratingly slow in their progress to market. That, experts say, is largely due to two hurdles which have so far prevented any meaningful advances in male contraception from making their way to market.\nBasic anatomy of the male reproductive system ( Wikimedia commons )\nThe first obstacle is that men\u2019s reproductive health is less well-understood than women's. \"There is a huge knowledge gap between our knowledge of men and women\u2019s reproductive health,\" says Lisa Campo-Engelstein, a professor at the Albany Medical College who studies male birth control . \"We didn\u2019t start really working on andrology [the study of male reproductive health] until the 1960s, and while most people know what a gynecologist is today, very few are familiar with even the concept of an andrologist.\"\nMany people also believe that, from a contraceptive perspective, females have the advantage of a single target, as women rely on one egg at a time to get pregnant. Human males, on the other hand, make thousands of sperm per second. We typically fire off 200 million of these little heat seekers when we ejaculate, and it only takes one perseverant tadpole to create a new life \u2014 so even drugs that eliminate 90% of our sperm aren\u2019t good enough.\nBut Campo-Engelstein says that the entrenched stereotypes about men and women\u2019s roles when it comes to birth control are far more important than the number of sperm. \"There are all sorts of claims about the biological reasons, but a lot of them are really social and cultural.\" As I learned, there are a lot of promising methods currently in the trial phase, but it seems like many have been stuck there for a while. \"The joke in the field is we\u2019re five to ten years away, and it\u2019s been like that since the 1970s,\" says Campo-Engelstrein of a male birth control pill. \"The pharmaceutical companies have decided its not a good business, and so there just isn\u2019t the money to make the jump from research to market.\"\nCondom display ( trec_lit\/flickr ).\n.\nCampo-Engelstein is eager for a male LARC \u2014 Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t have much confidence one will emerge anytime soon. While women currently have eleven different options for birth control men have just two: vasectomy or condoms, and only one of those is reversible. Condoms might seem like the simplest solution, but as Campo points out, they have a 16 percent failure rate, far worse than the protection offered by most female birth control. And yet of all the funding that went into contraceptive research in the 1990s, she found just seven percent went towards studying new methods for male birth control.\nAnother big issue is one of responsibility and trust. Campo-Engelstein's research found the perception in the mainstream media and inside big pharma was, \"If she can\u2019t trust you to take out the garbage, how can she trust you to handle birth control?\" But she says that studies have also shown that\u2019s not really true. \"There is evidence that women will trust their long term monogamous partners to be in control of reproductive health and birth control, but the big pharmaceutical companies are blinded by these old gender stereotypes.\"\nThe final obstacle is that men tend to be extremely suspicious of anything that might impair their sexual ability or diminish their virility. \"The way men see it, Viagra enhances you, makes you more of a man, while contraception does the opposite,\" says Campo-Engelstein. \"Men are literally concerned that it might shrink their penis!\" She notes the irony that many methods of female birth control do reduce libido, but that society assumes women can handle that in a way men couldn't.\nI never had shrinkage as a particular worry, but I must admit that a creeping fear of impotence was never far from my mind as I approached the day of my surgery. A slip of the knife, that one in million procedure with severe complications \u2014 and I would be losing the use of the part of me that I can't imagine wanting to live without.\nThe cutting room floor\nIt\u2019s a couple of weeks till my vasectomy and my wife wants to have a serious talk. So we eat dinner, give a bath, read a story, and put the boys to bed. Sitting on our couch she tells me that, while she agrees two children are all we can handle now, maybe she would like a third one, after all. Hopefully a little girl \u2014 if some day, we can handle it.\n\"So your doctor said it\u2019s not reversible, the vasectomy?\"\n\"So your doctor said it\u2019s not reversible, the vasectomy?\"\nI tell her it\u2019s not guaranteed; that, while it\u2019s possible, we\u2019re better off thinking of it as permanent. I could always freeze some sperm now, although that would be pricey. Also, since I would still be making sperm, I could always have surgery to harvest some, and we could pursue artificial insemination.\n\"Maybe I could get an IUD,\" she says. Initially, she'd wanted to avoid that, as the side effects can include a heavier period, with an increase in PMS and menstrual cramps. But she preferred those to the challenges a vasectomy might pose to future kids, should we change our minds. \"I want to keep our options open. I think it\u2019s something I should try before we do anything so serious.\"\nOf course, I'm also hugely relieved\n.\nI\u2019m ready for this vasectomy, I tell her. I\u2019m committed to our family, by which I mean family planning and, uh, our sex life. She gives me look that says, \"Thank you sweet man, but you\u2019re not making this call.\" I realize that perhaps, by ceding control of this decision to her, I'm playing into the same gender stereotypes that kept my options for birth control so limited. That's a trap I don't see a good way out of, at least for the time being.\nOf course, I\u2019m also hugely relieved: relieved to not be making the decision; relieved to not have to worry about whether we'll be able to make more children if we want them; and especially relieved not to have my scrotum pierced and my tubes cauterized. We can wait a few more years for the long-promised breakthroughs to finally make their way to market. In the meantime, I should get my wife some flowers.\nLead illustration by Dylan Lathrop.\n","Title":"The kindest cut: my journey into the nether regions of male birth control | The Verge","Tags":["features","science"]}
