{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMarvel has released a new poster for Avengers: Age of Ultron, and while it isn't as intense as the first one (see \" fighting a swarm of robots ,\" below), this poster underscores the studios' ongoing tease of the film's brand new superhero, Vision.\n\u2014 Marvel Entertainment (@Marvel) February 24, 2015\nSee him just above the Hulk? Here he is again in the top left corner:\nNow... enhance!\nIn the comics, Vision (or \"The Vision\") is an android created by Ultron, our eponymous villain, but is convinced by The Avengers to fight alongside the good guys. That's not necessarily how it'll play out in the film, but we do have one important clue to how Vision will be incorporated into Age of Ultron: Paul Bettany. The actor portraying Vision has also served as the voice of JARVIS, Tony Stark's AI companion, since the first Iron Man film.\nAs far as powers go, Bettany himself ( via Screen Rant ) said that his character is \"very good at punching... and also has the ability to change his density\" (how that translates on screen is to be determined). He can also fly, because that's part of the basic superhero package.\nOutside of the mainstream promotional materials, Marvel has been pretty open about Vision \u2014 here he is  as a wall decal . And if you're wondering what he'll look like as a tangible object, here are the official action figures shown off at the recent Toy Fair (via Cinema Blend and IGN ):\nIt's not long now \u2014 The Avengers: Age of Ultron will hit theaters May 1st, 2015.\n","Title":"This is the superhero Marvel is teasing in the new Avengers: Age of Ultron poster | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
