After  reports circulated last year that the streaming service was looking to revive the 2001 cult comedy as a TV series,  Deadline now reports that filming is already underway. Writer Jake Fogelnest subsequently  confirmed the report on Twitter . According to Deadline, the Netflix-exclusive series will span eight episodes, and will include much of the original cast, including the likes of Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd. David Wain and Michael Showalter, who wrote the film, are reportedly leading the new series as well.\nThis isn't the first time that Netflix has brought back a cult comedy series, as the company launched  a fourth season of Arrested Development back in 2013 , after the show was cancelled. Similarly, Yahoo is  planning to bring back troubled series Community for a sixth season . There's no word yet on when the new Wet Hot American Summer will make its Netflix debut.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
