{"Main text":"'We Are Ninjas' is this generation's version of Vanilla Ice's 'Ninja Rap'\nSo bad, it's good...almost\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBack in 1991, at the zenith of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' cultural domination, Vanilla Ice released a ridiculously catchy song called \" Ninja Rap \" for the soundtrack of the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. This week, more than 23 years later, a new TMNT movie is hitting theaters, and there's a new song to go with it.  \"We Are Ninjas\" by Pentatonix is not an official part of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles soundtrack, but maybe it should be, with its earnest portrayal of the turtle lifestyle (\"rising up like steam from a sewer cap...y'all give me that extra large piece of pepperoni with the parmesan cheese\"). Whatever you think of it, the song is certainly more memorable than  the official movie soundtrack single released in July.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
