{"Main text":"Nintendo is making a Mii app for smartphones\nBut mobile games are still off the table\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNintendo has been infamously reticent when it comes to embracing mobile devices, but the company is slowly changing its tune \u2014 and soon there will be an app to prove it. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata recently revealed that Nintendo is working on an app that would let users use their Mii avatars outside of games and the company's own Miiverse social network.\n\"It would be fun for players to use their Mii characters as icons on social media.\"\n\"It would be fun for players to use their Mii characters as icons on social media,\" he told  Japan's Nikkei business daily . \"We are currently developing an application that will allow users to do that.\" The app will be officially announced later in the year, and right now there are next to no details \u2014 we don't know what social networks it will support and on what mobile platforms it will be available.\nIt doesn't sound like the most robust app \u2014 it's a far cry from actually developing smartphone apps or games that utilize Nintendo vast library of well-known characters \u2014 and it shows how slowly Nintendo has been moving in the mobile space compared to its competitors. While Microsoft has Smartglass and Sony lets you  stream PlayStation games to certain mobile devices , Nintendo has done very little in this space. In 2012, Nintendo released  a Pokedex app for iOS , and more recently it partnered with Japanese mobile developer Gungho to create  a Super Mario spin-off of the studio's massively popular Puzzles & Dragons game. However, the new release will be coming to the 3DS as opposed to smartphones.\nIwata previously expressed an interest in making smartphone apps  early last year , though little has come of that in the time since. It's also clear that, apps aside, Nintendo remains steadfast in its decision not to make smartphone games, and instead focus on its own dedicated hardware \u2014 just today it launched a new version of its 3DS handheld in North America . \"In the past, I have opposed making smartphone and tablet versions of Nintendo titles,\" Iwata explained. \"Prices for content aimed at smartphones and tablets are falling quickly. I am still wary of the category.\"\n","Title":"Nintendo is making a Mii app for smartphones | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
