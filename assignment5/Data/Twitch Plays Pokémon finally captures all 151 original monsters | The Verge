{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMore than a year after an ever-changing group of internet strangers  first completed Pokémon Red by pressing random buttons,  Twitch Plays Pokémon has  finally caught every single one of the 151 collectible creatures in the Game Boy game. After 39 days of play, the final Pokémon \u2014 genetically modified cat-thing Mewtwo \u2014 was captured today.\nAs with previous versions of Twitch Plays Pokémon, the game's main character was directed by viewers watching through the streaming service. While players of the standard version can beat Pokémon Red by simply beating the game's final bosses, the Elite Four \u2014 a feat achieved by the first version of Twitch Plays Pokémon early last year \u2014 this version of the game  was modified so it could only be completed by capturing all 151 original monsters.\nThe modified version also featured legendary Pokémon that would respawn, meaning that if the jumble of thousands of inputs at the same time failed to capture majestic creatures such as Zapdos, Articuno, and Mewtwo himself the first time they met, they'd get another shot to complete their Pokédex. The hacked game also let players buy master balls, making for easy captures \u2014 if, that is, they could successfully guide player character AIIIAAB (named by committee) to the store. You can watch the last 20 minutes of the successful run above, and also watch AIIIAAB get  his Pokémon diploma , and get his  Pokédex rated by Pokémon expert Professor Oak.\n","Title":"Twitch Plays Pokémon finally captures all 151 original monsters | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
