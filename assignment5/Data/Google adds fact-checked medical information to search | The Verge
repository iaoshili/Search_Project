{"Main text":"Tech\nGoogle adds fact-checked medical information to search\nBasic information on symptoms, treatments, and the rarity of the conditions will now pop up in the Knowledge Graph\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle is introducing  high-quality medical data to its search engine, hoping to give users worried about that rash that won't go away some fact-checked peace of mind. Starting in the next few days, anyone Googling common health conditions will be presented with key information about their query including symptoms, treatments, and \"details on how common the condition is \u2014 whether it\u2019s critical, if it\u2019s contagious, what ages it affects, and more.\"\nOne in 20 google searches are health-related\nThe internet giant knows it already has a massive audience for this information: internet-assisted hypochondriacs have been around for years now, and the company says that one in 20 Google searches are health-related. The data will be prominently displayed to users as part of the  Knowledge Graph \u2014 those boxes of basic information that usually show up on the right side of searches carried out on laptops \u2014 and in some cases will be accompanied by \"high-quality illustrations from licensed medical illustrators.\"\nHow the new medical data will appear on mobile searches. ( Google )\n\"We worked with a team of medical doctors (led by our own Dr. Kapil Parakh, M.D., MPH, Ph.D.) to carefully compile, curate, and review this information,\" said Google product manager Prem Ramaswam. \"All of the gathered facts represent real-life clinical knowledge from these doctors and high-quality medical sources across the web, and the information has been checked by medical doctors at Google and the Mayo Clinic for accuracy.\"\nNevertheless, Google is at pains to remind users that the new feature \"doesn\u2019t mean these search results are intended as medical advice.\" The company doesn't want the liability of even pretending to replace doctors, but instead will give sniffling, aching, or sneezing users a starting point to carry out more research.\nIn essence, Google is simply standardizing a function it's been offering for years via third-party sources. But with  more and more tech companies interested in handling medical data , it's hard not to see this announcement as part of a long-term plan as well. Googled medical data is a byword for unverified, scaremongering advice \u2014 by fact-checking this basic data in advance, Google can begin to build up some trust in its medical credentials. Apple's HealthKit app may be steps ahead of Google Fit in terms of  partnerships with hospitals , but no-one can beat Google when it comes to broad reach. If customers can get used to trusting what Google has to say about tonsillitis, then they might be happier with trusting  what it has to say about cancer too .\n","Title":"Google adds fact-checked medical information to search | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
