{"Main text":"Report\nSquare goes global, turns on its Register app for 130 currencies around the world\nMerchants around the world were already using Square's app, but had to find workarounds for downloads and currency\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSince it launched its  Register app two and a half years ago, Square has noticed adoption all around the world. But until today, people using it outside the US had to find a way to access the US app store to get it. They also had to use the app in dollars and convert it to their local currency manually. Even with all that, the company saw thousands of merchants adopting Register. So they decided to expand it reach, announcing today that Register will be available worldwide in four languages and 130 currencies.\n\"Even before today's announcement, we've seen thousands of downloads of our Register app by sellers around the world to track their sales, manage their inventory and access meaningful insights about their business through our rich analytics. Even if it was inconvenient, and not optimized for their language or currency, many sellers have clearly found our software effective. I talked with a woman in Zambia who was using Register, because she preferred it to the Excel spreadsheets that she was using before,\" says Catherine Ferdon, a Square spokeswoman. \"She wanted to know if we would ever provide the ability to use it with her native currency, the kwacha. Today we're making that possible.\"\nWe've seen people route around restrictions to download and use our Register app. Sellers in China, UK, Mexico, Iraq! http:\/\/t.co\/OAWTzqY7uZ\n\u2014 Jack (@jack) November 20, 2014\nSquare began as a merchant services company, focused on serving small sellers who couldn't afford a traditional point-of-sale system. With a cheap card reader and an iPhone, anyone could use Square to handle credit and debit transactions. Since then the company has tried their hand at a few consumer offerings, with mixed success. It  killed off its wallet app , but has been making headway with Square cash, a simple way for users to exchange funds. That service was recently integrated into Snapchat, an avenue that may finally work to bring lots of consumers onboard Square's network.\nI believe there's finally more value in Square's software and services than in the hardware \"dongle\" we're known for. http:\/\/t.co\/OAWTzqY7uZ\n","Title":"Square goes global, turns on its Register app for 130 currencies around the world | The Verge","Tags":["report","business","tech"]}
