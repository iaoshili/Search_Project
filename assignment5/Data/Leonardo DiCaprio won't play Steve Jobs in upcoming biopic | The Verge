{"Main text":"Leonardo DiCaprio won't play Steve Jobs in upcoming biopic\nChristian Bale is back on the list\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLeonardo DiCaprio is no longer in talks to play Steve Jobs in the upcoming biopic written by Aaron Sorkin,  according to The Hollywood Reporter . This movie has been in the works for a while now, and this is the second big change that it's gone through this year: originally, David Fincher was in talks to direct it with Christian Bale as the star, but in April, the studio instead  decided to put it in the hands of Danny Boyle , director of Slumdog Millionaire, with DiCaprio as its lead.\nThe Reporter now says that Bale is back on the list of potential names to play Jobs. Alongside him is said to be Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Bradley Cooper \u2014 though the Reporter suggests that Affleck is an unlikely choice due to scheduling conflicts. There's no suggestion as to who might be the leading candidate, but Bale's recurrence here suggests that the studio certainly views him as a good fit. This remains the Jobs film that people really want to see, but for now, there's still no suggestion as to when we'll actually be able to see it.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
