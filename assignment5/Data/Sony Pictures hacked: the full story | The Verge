And there\u2019s at least some good news: the company estimates it made a net profit of ¥89 billion ($756 million) between October and December, up 238 percent from a year earlier.\nOperating profit is forecast at ¥178.3 billion ($1.51 billion), and revenue is expected...\nMore layoffs in the mobile division\nUpdate\nSony Pictures expects to have some critical systems back online in early February\nBy Sam Byford on January  23, 2015 04:06 am\nSony has announced that it's applying for an extension of the deadline to submit its third-quarter securities report \"due to the amount of destruction and disruption that occurred\" following the  massive cyberattack directed against its movie division.

It's pretty incredible how much has changed since then. We've seen the Seth Rogen \/ James Franco comedy make its way through a limited theatrical run, pushed out to every video-on-demand service known to man, and now we'll be getting a physical media release to close it all out.
