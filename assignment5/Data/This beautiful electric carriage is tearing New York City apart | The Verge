{"Main text":"This beautiful electric carriage is tearing New York City apart\nCustom-built electric car hopes to take on Central Park's horse-carriage industry\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere in New York City, politicians, activists, and celebrities are renewing a hundred-year-old battle between automobiles and horse-drawn carriages. This time, however, the war isn\u2019t over the future of personal transportation: it\u2019s about the 68 horse-drawn carriages that offer tourists meandering rides around Central Park.\nThe rides are a New York mainstay, but opponents argue that the long days on busy city streets are dangerous and inhumane. To fight this battle, activists are turning to the same weapon that was used a hundred years ago: an electric, brass-era horseless carriage. And after a year of work, the vehicle has been unveiled for the first time at the New York International Auto Show on Manhattan\u2019s west side \u2014 just blocks from the stables that the Central Park horses call home.\nAt first glance, the so-called \u201CHorseless eCarriage\u201D looks like it might belong in a kitschy Disneyland ride. But step up close, and it\u2019s clear that this is no tacky, turn-of-the-century facade on a modern vehicle. \u201CIt\u2019s a labor of love,\u201D says Jason Wenig, the passionate, straight-talking Brooklyn native behind the vehicle. His Florida-based classic car restoration shop, The Creative Workshop, was commissioned to build the vehicle by NYCLASS (New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets), an animal rights group that\u2019s leading the charge against the Central Park horse-carriage industry.\nWenig\u2019s words don\u2019t come across as a cliche. Polished brass fittings are sprinkled across the car. The bench seats have an old-school, diamond-tufted pattern \u2014 though Wenig tells me with a hearty laugh that the upholstery is made of vinyl, not leather. There\u2019s even a cute (if obnoxious) \"ahooga\" horn, and the dashboard\u2019s made of wood.\n\"I took my favorite things from that era and combined them into the ultimate homage.\"\nUpon an even closer look, other details stand out, like the electric charging connector, which is located just below the radiator \u2014 right where you\u2019d expect to find the hand crank. Perhaps most impressive is the custom-made, period-authentic chassis and traditional leaf-spring suspension that really makes it look like a brass-era car.\nThe horseless carriage might look like cars from the period, but it\u2019s not a replica \u2014 it\u2019s a custom-made creation designed by Wenig. \"I took my favorite things from that era and combined them into the ultimate homage,\" he tells me in a telephone interview. He borrowed bits and pieces from period touring cars made by Pierce-Arrow, Rolls Royce, and Maxwell.\nOnce he drew up his dream car, the struggle was to turn it into a reality. That meant passing federal regulations. To make it, Wenig had to add modern touches not found on vehicles from 1909, like a windshield, electric headlamps, and seat belts.\nNYCLASS wanted an electric vehicle from a start, so he brought in an EV expert from Canada who could deliver a \"rock-solid, basic, straight-forward, and highly-technologically advanced\" drivetrain. The result is an electric vehicle with 100 miles of range that can last the 16-hour shifts that carriage drivers work. But this is no Tesla. Wenig is the first to admit that \"they\u2019re in a different world.\" The Horseless eCarriage can go a maximum of 30 miles per hour, and GPS sensors automatically lock it down to 5 miles per hour in Central Park. \"Basically, it\u2019s a really, really sexy, sophisticated golf cart.\"\n\"Basically, it\u2019s a really, really sexy, sophisticated golf cart.\"\nBut that golf cart is rolling into what\u2019s become a heated politicized battle ever since New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on the campaign trail that he\u2019d ban horse carriages during his first week in office. NYCLASS contributed over $1.3 million to that campaign, and it put up the $450,000 for the electric carriage revealed today.\nAllie Feldman, a representative for the group, says that they decided to go for the vehicle after attempts to outright ban the horse-carriage industry failed because of concerns about the 150 drivers employed by the rides. So they\u2019re taking a different approach: \"We see this as upgrading the industry \u2026 not banning the industry,\" Feldman tells The Verge. If a horse ban can pass through the City Council, NYCLASS plans to open a shop in Brooklyn or Queens to construct more of the electric carriages. They\u2019d sell for roughly $150,000 to $200,000.\nDe Blasio supports that plan, but as the horse ban blossomed into a national news story, the mayor figured out that passing such a law might not be so easy. He recently announced that while the ban\u2019s been delayed, \"we expect action on it this year.\" In the meantime, celebrities have hopped on board to assist in the fight, with Alec Baldwin, Miley Cyrus, and more throwing their weight behind the ban. Others, like Liam Neeson, are working to build support for the horse-carriage industry. He\u2019s discussed the horse ban on multiple late-night talk shows, and he wrote an op-ed on the matter that was published this week in The New York Times .\nOpponents of the ban point out that only four horses have died in the past 30 years, and experts say that inspections ensure proper conditions for the animals. And they suspect that the horse ban is motivated not by animals\u2019 rights, but the business that leads to so many decisions in New York City: real estate. Two of the horse stables lie on valuable plots on Manhattan\u2019s far west side \u2014 land that\u2019s prime for redevelopment. NYCLASS representatives have denied such claims.\nWhatever the result of the battle, it\u2019s given birth to an impressive machine. The electric car might not have quite the charm of a horse and buggy, but it\u2019s sure to get any car fanatic in a tizzy.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe brass-era car is dubbed the \"Horseless eCarriage,\" and it's designed to seat the driver and eight passengers.\nIt's not a replica \u2014 the car was custom-made and the designer borrowed much of the look from 1909 touring cars.\nThe horseless carriage maxes out at 30 miles per hour, and a GPS sensor automatically locks it to 5 miles per hour in Central Park.\nDesigner Jason Wenig (seated here), says they choose the distinctive green color to highlight the \"eco-friendly\" theme of the car.\nDials and knobs allow the driver to monitor battery charge, turn on the heat, and use a PA system built into the vehicle.\nThe car's massive lithium ion battery pack gives it 100 miles of range and enough stamina to last a 16 hour shift. That comes at a price, however: the entire vehicle weighs 7,500 pounds.\nPeel back the hood, and the retro look and feel washes away. This is the thoroughly modern, 84-horsepower electric motor that drives the car.\nThe back storage compartment is designed to hold a removable convertible top for the car, which will come in handy during foul weather.\nJason Wenig designed the carriage for NYCLASS, an activist group pushing to ban the horse carriage industry in New York. Wenig is the owner of The Creative Workshop, a Florida-based independent restoration shop that built the car.\nAs a nice touch, The Creative Workshop spun up a new name and logo just for the carriage.\nMayor Bill de Blasio hopes to pass a ban on horses sometime this year, paving the way for more of these electric carriages, which would cost drivers $150,000 to $200,000 each.\n","Title":"This beautiful electric carriage is tearing New York City apart | The Verge","Tags":["report","photo-essay","design","us-world"]}
