They\u2019re relatively cheap laptops that over-perform for their price because there\u2019s so little extra software junk to slow things down. They top the list of best sellers on Amazon. They can do a lot of things, but they can\u2019t do everything. They\u2019re great second computers.\nBut the Pixel is something different: a Chromebook that makes the case that it doesn\u2019t need to be your second laptop; it can be your only laptop. Or at least, that's the promise we thought Google was making two years ago, when it introduced the original Pixel . But maybe that's the wrong way to look at it. In reality, virtually everybody is going to run into spots where they need something that Chrome OS can\u2019t quite offer. Unless you\u2019re so deeply bought into Google\u2019s vision of how the web and how computing should work that you\u2019re willing to suffer through the parts that it\u2019s not good at (yet?), it doesn\u2019t make sense for you to spend upwards of a thousand dollars on a Pixel. And that\u2019s how much this spare, beautiful machine with a high-resolution touchscreen costs: $999.\nI don\u2019t know who the new Chromebook Pixel is for, but I know that I want one.\nUnless you\u2019re intimately familiar with the original Pixel, you wouldn\u2019t be able tell the new one apart from it. Google has decided to stick with the same basic, boxy design \u2014 and honestly, I still love it. The case is still entirely metal with a plastic hinge and glass screen, and everything is right angles with softened corners. The horizontal light bar on the back that glows with a rainbow when it\u2019s on is still the most prominent sign that you\u2019re using a Chromebook instead of a prop from an avant garde sci-fi movie.\nIf I had to pick one word to describe the design, I\u2019d choose \"solid.\" Unfortunately, \"solid\" also implies \"dense,\" and the Pixel feels heavy at 3.3 pounds. That\u2019s less than half a pound heavier than the 13-inch MacBook Air, but a lot of the Pixel\u2019s weight is situated in its large 3:2 touchscreen, so overall it feels a little more unwieldy.\nThe original design still holds up\nThat\u2019s a minor issue, though, because I still love the look and feel of the Pixel. Keeping the design the same also sends a signal: this isn\u2019t a new kind of thing for Google, it\u2019s still the expensive, top-end laptop you have already heard of.\nBut two years between models is a lot of time, and Google has added some subtle design tweaks. The top function row of the keyboard now has standard keys instead of the weird, clicky buttons that the original Pixel had. The hinge has been tweaked to make it stiffer, so the screen doesn\u2019t bounce around as much when you touch it. The backlight settings on the keyboard have been tuned so it only turns on when your hands are actually over it.\nThe new Pixel\u2019s display is still a super-sharp, 12.85-inch, 2560 x 1700 touchscreen. Google says it\u2019s increased the sRGB color gamut, but I wasn\u2019t really unhappy with colors on the old Pixel. I will say that although Chrome OS has gotten better with basic touchscreen responsiveness (especially on pinch-to-zoom), I am not at all convinced that the Pixel needs a touchscreen.\nThe only reason the touchscreen makes sense is when you consider what the Pixel is actually for: letting Google test out advanced features for Chrome OS. The company tells me that the reason that touchpads on other Chromebooks are as good as they are is because of the Pixel: Google got to use it as a testing ground to optimize the drivers and so on. A recent leak had a Google employee quoted as saying \"this is a development platform. This is really a proof of concept. We don\u2019t make very many of these.\" So if you want to know why the Pixel is so expensive, there\u2019s part of your answer.\nOne last design touch: when the laptop is closed, you can \"knock\" on the top of it to get the lightbar to show your remaining battery life. And let me tell you about the battery life: it\u2019s out-of-this-world good. The last Pixel was a disappointment in that regard, and most other Chromebooks are serviceable, but not stupendous. Google rates this Pixel as good for 12 hours, and in our own battery test, it clocked in at 14. I\u2019ve been using it for many hours at a time without worrying about charging it at all. I\u2019m usually the guy who dives for every power jack I see even if I only have a few minutes to top off. Yet right now as I\u2019m typing, the charger is sitting just out of arm\u2019s reach. I\u2019m down to 55 percent battery life and I can\u2019t be bothered to lean over and plug it in.\nBut if I could be bothered, I\u2019d be able to plug it in on either side of the laptop, because there are two new ports: USB Type-C. Just a couple of days ago, we saw Apple aggressively endorse this new standard by making it the only port on the new MacBook , and now Google is also getting behind the standard. I could wax on about how I\u2019m weirdly excited about this jack-of-all-trades port that works equally well for power, USB connectivity, and displays. Instead, I\u2019ll just point out that it\u2019s another sign that the Pixel is as much a development platform as it is a consumer device. Adding these ports to the Pixel should mean we\u2019ll also see them on other, cheaper Chromebooks down the road. Unlike the new MacBook, Google is keeping the legacy ports on the Pixel, which means you\u2019ll also get two USB 3 ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone \/ mic jack.\nThe new Pixel is fast. It has an Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (plus the 1TB of cloud storage that you get from Google Drive for three years). The extra RAM means that the Pixel is less likely to bog down when you have lots of tabs open. While reviewing, I\u2019ve never had fewer than 10 open at any time, and many of those were fairly heavy web apps. And even with all those tabs, loading web pages is still stupid fast. The only thing I\u2019ve seen that compares is Safari on a top-of-the-line Mac. Every time I load a page on this Chromebook, I stare daggers at Chrome running on my MacBook Air.\nThe new Pixel is one of the first laptops to ship with USB-C ports\nFor $300 more, you can get the Chromebook Pixel LS, which has a faster Core i7 processor, a staggering 16GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. In typical lighthearted Google fashion, the LS stands for \"Ludicrous Speed.\" (I wasn\u2019t able to test that model, so I don\u2019t know if the wallpaper is plaid .)\nIn general, Chrome OS feels like it has filled out a lot more in the last year or so. There are no huge updates to go along with the new Pixel, but if you haven\u2019t used it in awhile, you might be surprised at how much better it is compared to early versions. Google is quick to point out that there are some Android apps you can use on Chromebooks now, but it would be charitable to call the selection spartan. Really, it\u2019s only a tiny handful of apps like Vine and Evernote. But there are other ways in which Chrome OS is much closer to being a legitimate primary OS than it was before: Docs works offline really well, and it can even \"natively\" open Microsoft Office files when you\u2019re online or offline without having to convert them (another trick I wish Chrome on my Mac could pull off).\nChrome OS is still too limiting for most people\nSo yes, Google is chipping away at the pain points that might keep you from going all-in with a Chromebook as your only computer, but even so, it\u2019s nowhere near where it needs to be to really make that case. Basically, you could talk yourself into the idea that you really won\u2019t need \"advanced\" apps like full-featured games, photo editors, or video editors. And you could convince yourself that even if you do, you are willing to do something weird like streaming Photoshop over a browser. But if you\u2019re the kind of person who is willing to jump through those hoops, you\u2019re probably the kind of person who should just get a traditional computer in the first place.\nAll that said, the core experience of using the browser, web apps, and even the occasional Chrome app or game is really solid and, in a lot of ways, superior to using equivalent apps and services on a desktop. Basically, the stuff I spend 70 percent of my time on is as good or better on the Pixel than it is on my two-year-old MacBook Air. But I need that other 30 percent too much to suffer through missing it or hacking my way toward a solution.\nWhen I started reviewing the new Chromebook Pixel, I figured it would be a good idea to check our review of the original from two years ago . Here\u2019s what we wrote: \"Everyone should want a Chromebook Pixel \u2014 I certainly do. But almost no one should buy one.\"\nStill true.\nThe new Chromebook Pixel isn\u2019t meant to outsell other laptops or even to expand Chrome OS' marketshare. It's a development platform, one that will eventually make all other Chromebooks better. It\u2019s also a premium laptop for people who can afford to spend a lot of money on the best thing, even if they don\u2019t use it as their main machine.\nThe new Chromebook Pixel is slightly cheaper than its predecessor, at $999, but it\u2019s still wildly more expensive than other Chromebooks. It has almost the exact same design as the original, and thus is a beautiful machine. It still runs Chrome OS, which has advanced significantly in the past two years, but not enough to be a real replacement for what you can do on a Mac or a PC.\nBut the improvements in battery life and speed are both huge. When you use it, the dichotomy between what your heart wants and what your brain says is almost bittersweet. It\u2019s an amazing laptop that I want to use all the time, but when I really need to do more intensive \"computer\" things, it\u2019s not quite enough.\nThey should have called it the Chromebook Paradox.\n","Title":"Chromebook Pixel (2015) review | The Verge","Tags":["google","review","tech"]}
