{"Main text":"This is the year to buy a new laptop\nThe laptop renaissance begins\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike PC gaming, laptops were supposed to be on their way out by now. Bulkier and less flexible than tablets, they were meant to be obviated by a more streamlined hybrid beast: the 2-in-1 computer that\u2019s both a laptop and a tablet. But here at CES 2015, what I see is not the demise, but the resurgence of the laptop in all its glorious varieties. Gaming machines are roaring louder, business PCs are doing more with less power, and, well, have you seen Dell\u2019s XPS 13 yet?\nEvery year brings iterative innovation and improvements, yes. What\u2019s different about this one is that a confluence of events has built up into a bubbling tide of awesome that\u2019s about to spill over the laptop market in 2015. Allow me to elaborate.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nIntel\u2019s 14nm Broadwell processor is finally ready for release. Having been announced and re-announced by Intel at every electronics show for the past couple of years, this week Broadwell leaps from promise to fulfilment. Intel tells me that this will be the fastest ramp-up in production and distribution in the company\u2019s history. Broadwell is being released \"across all price points and ranges at the same time,\" an unprecedented move for the company that will see Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, i5, i7, and even the freshly minted Core M brands all updated with Broadwell silicon.\nThe end of Broadwell's delays marks the start of a great time for laptop buyers\nAnd why should you care about Broadwell? At 14nm, its transistors are a fraction of the size of the 22nm Haswell that it\u2019s replacing, which translates into higher power, space efficiency, and lower heat emissions. The typical 15W CPU will now, all other things being equal, power a laptop through an extra 90 minutes of video playback. There are beefier graphics to be had, too, but that\u2019s one of those gradual updates that no one is going to jump up and down about it. What will excite people is the extension of battery life by up to 30 percent from the upgrade to Broadwell.\nThere\u2019s a stat that Intel is reciting regularly here at CES, which speaks to the company\u2019s goals: 600 million PCs around the world haven\u2019t been upgraded in the past four years. What we have on our hands is a significant reserve of pent-up demand, and what\u2019s needed to unlock it are compelling new devices. The twin factors of Broadwell\u2019s absence and AMD\u2019s continuing struggle to offer anything more than a budget CPU alternative to Intel have collectively made the laptop category feel stale and unexciting. It may not have been intentional, but Intel built up its own demand, and now it\u2019s about to capitalize on it in a big way by finally delivering the silicon to make significantly better machines possible.\nPrecision trackpad, edge-to-edge display, aluminum chassis \u2014 all for less than $800\nDell\u2019s XPS 13 is a visual and physical delight. It has an edge-to-edge screen that screams of future technology, and its top and bottom are reinforced with machined aluminum and carbon fiber elements. It\u2019s built like a rock, saves a bunch of space relative to any other 13-inch laptop, and even its touchpad is fast, responsive, and pleasurable to use. The best thing about the XPS, though, is that this computer will be far from alone. Dell\u2019s managed to squeeze all of those good things into a package it\u2019s pricing at $799, so we\u2019re not talking about the extreme, inaccessible peaks of high-end mobile PCs. Dell\u2019s clamshell is simply the harbinger of a new generation of devices that will be immediately, recognizably better than their predecessors. The almost bezel-free display uses Sharp's IGZO technology, though LG Display has shown similar designs in laptops from LG and Acer in the past, and we should see even more of them as the year rolls on, with Dell\u2019s pricing suggesting they\u2019ll be more affordable than before.\nAlienware, Dell\u2019s gaming brand, is coming to CES with refreshes of its over-the-top, LED-illuminated portable gaming machines. Though their evolution is less pronounced, the Alienware 15 and 17 are quite a bit slimmer and up to 20 percent lighter, plus the 15-inch model now has the option to be specced with a 4K touchscreen display. Alienware\u2019s been showing these new laptops off at CES alongside an external GPU box that will give you the power of a full desktop graphics card, should you require it. Then there\u2019s MSI\u2019s completely insane GT80 Titan , which comes with a mechanical keyboard and dual GeForce GPUs built in. It also has a set of golden WASD keys that will delight some and horrify (most) others.\nIt\u2019s not just Windows computers that are set for a revival this year. Acer has brought a 15-inch Chromebook to CES. When it comes to the budget \"buy something for your parents\" market, this new laptop is the most significant new entrant in years. We\u2019ve already noted how important of a factor screen size is for people looking to buy an uncomplicated and cheap laptop like a Chromebook, so giving them that XL option should now mean a bump in interest in Google\u2019s alternative to Windows. Acer\u2019s laptop is also well-made and has a design that doesn\u2019t betray its budget aspirations. As will the XPS 13, what we\u2019re seeing at CES is just the first of a new wave of nicer Chromebooks that serve people\u2019s needs better than before.\nBigger Chromebooks and smaller MacBooks will fill longstanding demand\nThe most significant (and consistent) CES absentee every year is Apple, but even its MacBooks managed to get into the news this week with a leak suggesting there\u2019ll be a leaner and meaner 12-inch MacBook Air coming this year. The key to making that happen, beyond the move to the more efficient Broadwell CPUs, is the newly introduced USB Type-C connector. Shaped like Apple\u2019s own Lightning plug, it\u2019s slim and symmetrical, and it\u2019s going to make it possible to build even thinner laptops than we already have. It\u2019s crazy to think it, but Type-C is the sort of blindingly obvious upgrade in convenience that may push some people over the edge to go and finally upgrade their years-old laptop.\nWhether it\u2019s Intel\u2019s chips, Apple\u2019s design chops, or the continuing refinement of Windows machines, you\u2019ll have more reasons to consider buying a new laptop in 2015 than in the previous three years combined. It\u2019s a good time to be in this market, that\u2019s for sure.\n","Title":"This is the year to buy a new laptop | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","report","tech","ces-2015"]}
