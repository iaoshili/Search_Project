{"Main text":"Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 appear side by side in latest leak\nNot quite the '3-sided screen' we were expecting\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe got a good look at what appears to be Samsung's  upcoming Galaxy S6 smartphone this morning. Now new images have leaked to show its sibling, the Galaxy S6 Edge, featuring a curved display similar to the one seen on Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. Pictures shared  on xda-developers forum claim to show an S6 and the S6 Edge  side by side , corroborating the expectation that Samsung would be releasing two versions of its latest flagship phone.\nUpdate: Read the  Galaxy S6 Edge review .\nThe purported S6 Edge is said to feature a dual curved-edge display, but the angle from which the photo was taken doesn't make it explicit. From the rear, the phones look markedly similar, but where the  Note Edge's curved section was large enough to act like a second screen, the sides of the S6 Edge's display appear to curve more subtly and offer little room for menu icons \u2014 the home screen in the photo simply stretches over the curved area. It's not quite the \"3-sided screen\"  reported by Bloomberg earlier this month.\nThe only other manufacturer showing off a true \"three-sided\" display at the moment is LG, whose Active Bending OLED screen was seen on a 6-inch smartphone  at CES earlier this year . We'll know whether these images are truly of Samsung's next big things very soon, when The Verge hits the show floor at  Mobile World Congress on March 1st .\n","Title":"Galaxy S6 Edge and Galaxy S6 appear side by side in latest leak | The Verge","Tags":["tech","mwc-2015"]}
