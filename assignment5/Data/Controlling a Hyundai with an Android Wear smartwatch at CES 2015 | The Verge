{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAutomakers are latching onto the wearables trend, integrating them with cars any way they can \u2014  Nissan ,  BMW , and a variety of others have shown their visions in recent years of how a smartwatch of the future might work on four wheels. Hyundai demonstrated Google Glass integration with its BlueLink connected car platform last year \u2014 not a hot topic anymore, considering how quiet Google's been on that front \u2014 so this year, it has Android Wear integration instead.\nThe watch app, which will be available early this year, duplicates much of the functionality already available on the existing BlueLink smartphone app: you can start the engine remotely, stop it, flash the lights, lock and unlock the doors, and find the car from afar if you've lost it in a parking lot. It can't do turn-by-turn navigation to the car directly on the watch, but it'll let you send the car's location out to Google Maps on your phone so you can navigate from there.\nIf you've got an Android Wear watch and a Hyundai (it supports existing models already on the road with BlueLink installed), this new functionality is a no-brainer \u2014 but it's certainly not something I'd consider buying a smartwatch for. All of the capabilities are already available in the phone app, which is just a pocket away \u2014 and in my testing, functions like remote engine starts and light flashes took long enough that you wouldn't want to sit there staring at your watch the entire time.\nStill, if starting your car with your watch isn't the future, I'm not sure what is.\n","Title":"Controlling a Hyundai with an Android Wear smartwatch at CES 2015 | The Verge","Tags":["hands--on","transportation","ces-2015"]}
