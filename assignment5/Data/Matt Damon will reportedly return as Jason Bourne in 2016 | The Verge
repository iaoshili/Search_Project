{"Main text":"Matt Damon will reportedly return as Jason Bourne in 2016\nFifth movie in the series will reunite Damon with director Paul Greengrass\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMatt Damon is apparently set to return to the big screen as genetically engineered super agent Jason Bourne.  Deadline reports that Universal Pictures is in talks with both Damon and director Paul Greengrass to produce a fifth movie based around the character created by author Robert Ludlum.\nGreengrass and Damon worked together on the second and third Bourne movies \u2014 The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum \u2014 which tracked the character's attempts to regain lost memories. Greengrass' decision to step back behind the camera indicates a change of heart. In 2009, he  walked away from production on a fourth Bourne movie over creative differences, and last year, the director said that he would  not return to the franchise . With Bourne's quest to restore his memory complete, the director apparently felt the character was stuck in a creative dead end. The new movie's story is yet to be revealed.\nGreengrass and Damon worked on the second and third Bourne movies\nFour Bourne movies were released in the ten-year spell between 2002 and 2012. Damon played the titular agent in the first three, before stepping away from the character. The fourth Bourne movie, The Bourne Legacy, instead stars Jeremy Renner as black ops agent Aaron Cross. Deadline says a spinoff sequel starring Renner's character remains in the works, but the movie, directed by Fast & Furious' Justin Lin, will be beaten to the box office by Damon's new Bourne when the latter arrives in July 2016.\n","Title":"Matt Damon will reportedly return as Jason Bourne in 2016 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
