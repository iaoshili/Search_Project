{"Main text":"Instagram adds 'Fade' and 'Color' tools\nAvailable today on Android, iOS 'in a few days'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere's no shortage of options when it comes to editing photos on your phone these days. There are apps with curated styles (likeÂ  VSCO Cam ), slick and simple ones ( Darkroom ), and feature-rich options ( Enlight ). Even tried-and-true desktop photo editing applications like Photoshop and Lightroom have mobile apps. Instagram, which accelerated the popularity of mobile photography a few years ago, has found itself playing a bit of catch-up, and in December it offered its first new filters in two years. Today, the app adds two new editing tools: \"Fade\" and \"Color.\"\nThe Fade tool works very much like it does on other editing apps. It softens the blacks and colors in your image for an \"aged film effect\" (Instagram's terms), and that effect can be adjusted using the same slider mechanism found throughout the app. The Color tool can be used to add a specifically hued tint to either the shadows or highlights of an image. It's not as subtle an effect, but you can adjust the severity of the tint with a slider here as well .\nNext\nThe new tools will be available in the newest update to the Instagram app, and will actually make it to Android users first for a change. Instagram for Android version 6.19.0 will be available in the Google Play store today, and the iOS update will roll out \"in a few days,\" according to the company.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that it wasn't possible to adjust the level of tint in the Color tool. The new Instagram update does allow that to happen.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
