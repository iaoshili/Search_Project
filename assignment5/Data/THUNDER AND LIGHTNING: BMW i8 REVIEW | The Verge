{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe BMW i8 is a $150,000 talisman of absurdity: when you\u2019re driving it, ridiculousness happens all around you. For example, on occasion, Australian actor and bona fide motorsports aficionado Eric Bana approaches you in a deserted sliver of Boston, alone and wearing a backpack. He asks when it comes out, how it performs. Then he wanders off into the golden rays of the mid-morning horizon, destination unknown.\nIn fairness, I can\u2019t say with certainty that it was Eric Bana. ( I tried bribing him, to no avail. ) But I do know that people have a fascination with this car that\u2019s unrivaled by any road-going object I\u2019ve ever been around.\nEffectively explaining the i8 in a few words can be a challenge. For lack of a better description, it\u2019s BMW\u2019s exclamation point: an unapologetic, outrageous supercar that looks unlike anything else the auto industry has ever made. In that regard it echoes unmistakable BMW icons like the 507 and M1, but the i8 is more than just a unique car \u2014 it\u2019s an over-the-top expression of BMW\u2019s vision for the future of the automobile.\nIt\u2019s a mess of beautiful contradictions. It\u2019s an exotic with just 357 total horsepower; it\u2019s an electric car with a gasoline engine; it\u2019s one of the most expensive cars BMW makes, yet has one of the lowest fuel costs.\nI spent three days driving this four-wheeled, carbon fiber-wrapped cluster of insanity through the spectacular New England fall. Eric Bana, eat your heart out.\nElegance, an acquired skill\nMy journey in the i8, which took me 960 miles from our New York City office to Maine\u2019s Acadia National Park and back, started inconspicuously enough in a Manhattan parking garage. Actually, that\u2019s a lie: not a single thing about the i8 is inconspicuous.\nJust getting into this car is a spectacle. One does not simply \"get into the i8,\" you see. You need a plan. If you don\u2019t have a plan, your reckless nonchalance imperils your dignity as you flop helplessly between the pavement, the i8\u2019s deeply recessed passenger compartment, and the tall, wide sill of fancy carbon-reinforced plastic that separates the two. Everyone looks the same the first time they try to get into the car: a hesitant approach, followed by a tentative duck, as if they\u2019re about to leap headfirst into the cabin and worry about the legs later. That doomed tactic is quickly abandoned and followed by a leg-first technique, which eventually succeeds with wildly varying levels of elegance. The entire time, you\u2019re at risk of bumping your skull against the open door, which rests just overhead.\nJust getting into this car is a spectacle\nDoor anxiety was gripping me, rushing through my mind as I headed to the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea to pick the car up. I handed the parking attendant my paperwork, proving that I\u2019d somehow convinced BMW to lend me a car worth more than my last several cars put together. His eyes grew wide. \"This is the one with the suicide doors, right?\" I briefly considered explaining the difference between suicide doors (which open rearward) and the i8\u2019s scissor doors, but I knew what he meant; more importantly, they\u2019re both conspicuous methods of egress designed to call attention to yourself as you step out of your whip and onto the set of Miami Vice. Cast in that light, I figure all crazy doors are suicide doors.\nLooks like an artifact from \u2018Tron\u2019 fell out of the heavens\nThe garage was small, working stiffs\u2019 rides stacked two high on the tail end of a Friday afternoon. After a few minutes spent searching for the i8 among the steel towers, the valet pulled it out onto the curb from an adjacent building. It was the first time in my journey that the car got special treatment, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t be the last. The valet handed me the key and smiled. \"Enjoy it.\"\nEasier said than done. I still had to come to grips with the challenge of getting into the i8, and my chances of looking cool getting into a fancy car in the heart of Chelsea, surrounded by trendy Manhattanites, were practically nil. That\u2019s a shame, because a sloppy entrance doesn\u2019t do the i8 justice. It\u2019s not just striking in the standard, gaze upon this meticulously designed supercar sort of way, the way you might stare at a Ferrari 458 or a Porsche 918. The i8 looks like an artifact from Tron fell out of the heavens somewhere near Munich and was given a once-over by some of the most fanatical automotive engineers in the world.\nIt\u2019s not particularly common to see a supercar delivered from the factory with a multicolor paint scheme \u2014 monochromatic often works best, because the cars\u2019 lines speak for themselves \u2014 but the i8 is a rare exception. My test car was silver and black with a touch of blue, and all three serve an important function: silver is the primary color, while black helps conceal the substantial vent on the hood and causes the science-fiction taillights to stand out from the remainder of the rear. Streaks of blue and a matching ring around the BMW roundel subtly identified the electric powertrain. It sounds ostentatious, but it just kind of works. I\u2019m actually not sure a monochrome i8 would look very good.\nAfter a couple walkarounds, I realized I was just distracting myself from the very real task of climbing into the car, so I did. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but I got in. I fiddled with the transmission joystick until I figured out how to pop it into drive, and shuttled off.\nPiloting the i8 on public roads is about the closest you can get to feeling like Bruce Wayne without literally being Batman. You\u2019re low to the ground, practically sitting on the pavement, next to slivers of windows that don\u2019t even roll down all the way (forget trying to look 5 percent cooler by throwing your elbow over the sill). The effect is enhanced at night by a series of beautiful light pipes on the dashboard and doors. They glow a rich blue by default, but can be reconfigured to glow orange or white depending on your mood and whether your Tron character is good or evil. You can also turn them off, but you don\u2019t own this car to drive it with the light pipes disabled. That would be crazy.\nThe closest you can get to feeling like Bruce Wayne without literally being Batman\nI drove the i8 with two white-knuckled fists on the steering wheel and my head on a swivel, partly because it wasn\u2019t mine, but also because it has the old sports car curse of limited visibility. Your rear view is through two panes of glass \u2014 one separating you from the engine compartment (ostensibly to cut noise) and the actual rear window, which is a deeply slanted hexagon. Blind spots are a challenge, too, but the car is outfitted with a bunch of tools to help: the side mirrors have built-in convex sections to cover the blind spots, and there are a bunch of cameras and sensors all over the place that identify obstacles. If you\u2019re dangerously close to something, a computer-generated overhead view of the car on the iDrive display helps negotiate tight spaces.\n\"Hey!\" a limo driver shouted from my left side. \"You want to trade, you let me know.\"\nThe i8 evokes strong, instant reactions everywhere it goes. It takes a truly enormous event to draw the attention of Manhattanites who spend their entire lives in a state of sensory overload, yet I couldn\u2019t travel more than a block without pedestrians grinning from ear to ear and whipping out their phones to take pictures. Some stood directly next to the car and indulged in a selfie. A garbage truck operator honked and gave me a thumbs-up. In the few fleeting seconds waiting for each red light to turn green, fellow drivers all wanted to know the same thing: What is it? How much power does it have? Is it electric? How much does it cost?\n\"Hey!\" a limo driver shouted from my left side. \"You want to trade, you let me know.\" He went on to summon my attention three different times as we traveled in adjacent lanes up 10th Avenue, his New York accent thick and genuine, asking the usual questions about the car and fondly recalling the memory of his Mercedes-Benz CLS 500. \"I had the first one in all of Manhattan,\" he beamed, proudly proclaiming that the swoopy four-door coupe elicited similar reactions when it first came out that the i8 was getting now.\nIn Queens\u2019 Astoria Park, the first of our many stops to shoot the car, drivers were quite literally coming to a full stop in the middle of the street to gawk. \"You made me do a U-turn,\" said one in a late-model BMW 3-Series that was full of twentysomethings looking for trouble on a Friday night. I felt like I was walking the world\u2019s cutest dog through Central Park, except instead of a dog it was a six-figure testament to German insanity, and instead of Central Park it was the entirety of New England.\nOnce we got on the expressway, Boston-bound, I was finally able to start taking in the car in earnest \u2014 its sights, its sounds, its features. (I was also finally starting to get the hang of ingress and egress, which was a big confidence-builder when we were stopping for food or bio breaks.) With the drivetrain in Comfort mode \u2014 the default, which lightens the steering and takes some fire out of the engine\u2019s belly \u2014 the i8 is nearly silent. The mode saves a bit on gas. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d ever use this; hell, even the porter who\u2019d delivered the car to me told me to just leave it in Sport for the entire drive. You don\u2019t buy a car that looks like this for silence. And while you might buy it to save on gas on principle, you\u2019re not buying it to save money. (For what it\u2019s worth, I got between 29 and 35 mpg on our trip, depending on how hard I was driving it. I suspect I could\u2019ve done considerably better if I\u2019d babied the throttle and stayed in Eco Pro mode, which is even more miserly than Comfort.)\nIn Sport mode, the car makes a symphony of wonderful sounds both high-tech and low. There\u2019s a Jetsons-esque whistle from the electric motor, another whistle of forced air from the turbo, and a thunderous growl from the\u2026 3-cylinder engine. It\u2019s completely incongruous for an engine this small to make this much noise. It\u2019s accomplished in part with exhaust tuning, and in part by artificially enhancing the engine sound through the i8\u2019s speaker system. Yes, the noise is fake. No, I don\u2019t care. It sounds great, it sounds like a sports car is supposed to sound. It\u2019s music to the ears, and if you didn\u2019t know what was going on, you\u2019d swear it was the genuine article. There will come a day in a decade or three when adults are accustomed to fast, silent sports cars, but until that day comes, BMW has carte blanche to make this gas sipper sound like a guzzler, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\nThere\u2019s also a mode that BMW calls \"eDrive,\" selected by pressing a button next to the ignition, which tries really hard (but doesn\u2019t promise) to run the car on electric power alone. The i8 reminds me of other gas-dependent plug-in hybrids in that it\u2019s not really intended to run in an electric-only mode for an extended period of time; it cuts over to gas if you go above 75 miles per hour (which, to be fair, will cover your legal activities on the overwhelming majority of American roads). More to the point, BMW quotes a maximum electric range of just 22 miles, and I never saw the range gauge go above 11, which isn\u2019t going to get you very far unless you use your German exotic exclusively for tragically slow, short jaunts around the isle of Manhattan. I couldn\u2019t fully test the i8\u2019s chops as an EV \u2014 the company supplied me with a European-spec model and warned me not to plug it in, if for no other reason than the fact that the supplied charger had a euro plug on it. Sport and Comfort mode both partially recharge the batteries automatically while you drive, but I was never able to fully replenish the pack. (If I had, it would\u2019ve happened in about an hour and a half on a standard Level 2 charger, according to BMW\u2019s literature.)\nBMW has carte blanche to make this gas sipper sound like a guzzler, as far as I\u2019m concerned\nIn Sport mode, BMW claims a 0-60 run in 4.2 seconds, which feels about right; even eDrive, which doesn\u2019t benefit from the gas engine\u2019s extra punch, feels fast. Acceleration isn\u2019t instantaneous, though. I\u2019d mash on the pedal expecting to be immediately glued to the back of my seat, only to be let down; it was almost as if the car was saying \"wait for it\u2026\" before lighting the afterburners. I imagine it\u2019s a side effect of an extraordinarily complex drivetrain that needs to coordinate power from two completely different systems \u2014 a two-speed, 129-horsepower motor in front and a six-speed engine with 228 horsepower in back \u2014 but there are lots of cars on the road, many at the $100,000 mark or below, that could smoke the i8. It\u2019s easy to get cocky in a car that looks like this, but it\u2019s not recommended.\nIt does handle well, which doesn\u2019t really come as a surprise: it\u2019s a low-slung supercar, after all. There\u2019s also BMW\u2019s fanatical demand for 50:50 weight distribution, putting a nearly identical amount of mass fore and aft. It\u2019s not particularly light \u2014 curb weight is listed at 3,455 pounds \u2014 but it would\u2019ve been even heavier had the company used a traditional construction technique instead of the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic that comprises the entire frame. You can see bits of it in the door sills and around the trunk; it\u2019s not as beautiful or as meticulously laid as a traditional carbon fiber weave, but it still looks different and cool.\nBring a chase car\nOver the next day and a half, we finished our drive to Boston before eventually reaching Maine\u2019s beautiful Acadia National Park in search of the perfect backdrops for our shoot. Along the way, we were stopped by two extremely friendly and awesome Massachusetts State Police officers, a throng of curious onlookers, and one possible Eric Bana.\nThat kind of road trip requires luggage. It\u2019s a lucky thing I had a chase car following me, because the i8 has the least storage space of any car I\u2019ve driven since my microscopic Lotus Elise: the rear glass pops open to reveal a trunk that would be generously described as a \"nook,\" or perhaps a \"cranny.\" That\u2019s the peril of a mid-engine car \u2014 the three-banger is concealed beneath a black carpeted box that consumes the overwhelming majority of the rear space.\nThe rear glass pops open to reveal a trunk that would be generously described as a \"nook,\" or perhaps a \"cranny\"\nSome rear-engined cars \u2014 Porsche 911s, for instance \u2014 make up for the indiscretion with a front bonnet that can hold a couple bags. Not the i8, though: that\u2019s where the electric motor is. In fact, the front of the car can\u2019t even be opened at all without some trouble. The space of last resort, then, is the area occupied by the rear seats \u2014 but they\u2019re deeply bucketed, which can make placing luggage a challenge (as I discovered). A few bags of groceries wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but road trips in an i8 are best enjoyed with a support vehicle, which you can probably afford if you\u2019re driving a $150,000 car.\nFor all the high-design futurism of the exterior, the interior is a bit bland. It\u2019s not ugly by any stretch, it\u2019s just not much nicer than BMWs that cost half as much. The trimmings are basically the same as the ones you\u2019d find in a 3- or 5-series: there\u2019s an iDrive controller in the center that maps to a widescreen display resting atop the center console, which is how you control navigation, entertainment, and an almost endless array of vehicle settings. The gear selector, which is basically a joystick, is also raided from the company-wide parts bin. The wide tunnel separating the driver from the front passenger is certainly cool and supercar-ish, but the two storage compartments in it are barely an inch or two deep, and there\u2019s only a single cupholder to share between you and your driving partner. Two more cupholders at the back of the tunnel service the rear passengers, which is funny, because the rear seats are the punchline to a six-figure joke: there\u2019s absolutely no reason for them to exist. It\u2019s possible you could stow a toddler back there, but really, you\u2019re not buying an i8 to haul three or four people around. BMW should\u2019ve just chucked the rear accommodations, saved the weight, and made this a genuine two-seater.\nOf course, it\u2019s sacrilege to judge a car like this by its storage options or its cupholders \u2014 who drinks in an i8, like a heathen? \u2014 but when you\u2019re trying to make it to Maine and back in the span of a couple days, willfully excessive caffeination is an inevitability.\nThe heads-up display (HUD) on the i8, which is similar to the system found on other BMWs, is really good. I really never looked at the instrument cluster while driving, actually, which is a testament to the HUD\u2019s usability. I\u2019ve used heads-up systems extensively, and I really do believe that good ones have a material impact on safety by keeping your eyes up on the road where they belong. This one does the job: I always felt like my current speed was somehow being beamed directly into my brain, which is what a good HUD does for you \u2014 it just becomes an ambient nexus of information, not something you need to concentrate on. The instrument cluster is less impressive: the surround looked weirdly plain to me, as if engineers had taken a tablet, masked off part of the display with paint, and glued the resulting Frankencluster to the dash. It\u2019s just not fitting for a car that looks and feels like this. BMW does make nice instrument clusters for sports cars \u2014 just look at the M4 and M6 \u2014 but those are digital-analog hybrids, incorporating both dials and displays. For the i-Series, it seems, BMW is sticking with digital displays alone, and those are harder to dress up. (It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the i3 also uses a plain-looking LCD for the cluster \u2014 albeit a smaller one.)\nThe actual graphics on the instrument cluster are, to be fair, appropriately cool. The 8.8-inch slab of glass is dominated by a pair of sharply rendered arcs that indicate speed and power distribution \u2014 basically, whether you\u2019re being propelled by batteries, gas, or a combination of both. Toggling the drivetrain\u2019s Sport mode changes the color scheme from blue to red, a non-verbal way of communicating that you\u2019ve summoned all the power that the i8\u2019s two sources of propulsion can muster.\nThe long goodbye\nThere are faster vehicles you can buy for the price of the i8, vehicles with better pedigrees and more legitimate sports car credentials. But you don\u2019t buy the i8 for any of that: you buy it because it\u2019s a tightly-wound bundle of technology and forward design. You buy it because it\u2019s the closest thing to a road-going concept car. You buy it because it\u2019s kind of weird. You buy it because it\u2019s a conversation starter, even among hardened NYPD street cops working the graveyard shift.\nYou also buy it because you have a lot of money to spare.\nWe lingered far too long in Maine just taking in the car, enjoying it, sharing it with countless passersby, and shooting it from every conceivable angle. We didn\u2019t get back into New York City until early the next morning, just hours before BMW was scheduled to pick it up. One of our final moments with the car took us through a deserted Times Square, which seemed fitting: electricity meeting electricity, spectacle meeting spectacle.\nYou buy it because it\u2019s the closest thing to a road-going concept car; you buy it because it\u2019s kind of weird\nAs I searched for a Manhattan garage that seemed trustworthy enough to hand the i8\u2019s keys at 3 in the morning, an NYPD cruiser lit me up. Drowsy from 16 hours of driving and filming, I briefly considered that a high-speed chase through the Big Apple would be the perfect end to this story; I came to my senses about a third of a second later and drifted off to the side of 29th Street. The officer approached my window, flashlight shining directly in my eyes. I\u2019d turned right on a red, which is illegal here, it turns out.\nAfter a stern talking-to, the conversation inevitably turned to the car. \"I asked my partner, what is that, a Lambo?\" I explained that it was not, in fact, a Lambo. I showed him the scissor doors, the carbon fiber; I described the unusual engine configuration. He smiled and told me to be safe; I told him to visit The Verge.\nVideo: Jordan Oplinger and Tom Connors\nPhotography: Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"THUNDER AND LIGHTNING: BMW i8 REVIEW | The Verge","Tags":["review","transportation"]}
