{"Main text":"Facebook and Instagram outage caused by an internal change, not hackers\nHipchat and Tinder also affected\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFacebook and Instagram were both taken offline this morning around 1AM ET, with a Facebook spokesperson telling The Verge that this was \"not the result of a third party attack but instead occurred after we introduced a change that affected our configuration systems.\" Hacking group Lizard Squad had originally hinted that it may have been responsible. Facebook's spokesperson added that the site's engineers \"moved quickly to fix the problem, and both services are back to 100% for everyone.\"\nTinder also reported being downtime this morning, sending a tweet earlier this morning  saying : \"EVERYBODY PANIC! #Blizzard? North Korea? #TindernetApocalypse.\" The site said that it had recovered an hour later, reassuring users: \"PS: Your matches aren't gone, just logout and log back in!\" Work messaging client Hipchat was also affected and claims it is still working on  restoring its services . It's possible that the downtime for these two sites was part of a domino effect caused by problems with Facebook's identity services.\nHacking group Lizard Squad, who previously claimed responsibility for the  attacks on Xbox Live and the PlayStation network over Christmas , suggested that they might have had a hand in these recent outages. A  pinned tweet on the group's Twitter account simply says \"Facebook, Instagram, Tinder, AIM, Hipchat #offline #LizardSquad,\" while an alleged member of the group tweeted  a picture of himself holding a sign saying \"dox me\" with the caption \"For all the mad people.\"\nFacebook, Instagram, Tinder, AIM, Hipchat #offline #LizardSquad\n\u2014 Lizard Squad (@LizardMafia) January 27, 2015\nUpdate January 27th 4:18AM ET: This article was updated to include additional comments from Facebook clarifying that the downtime was not the result of an attack.\n","Title":"Facebook and Instagram outage caused by an internal change, not hackers | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","tech"]}
