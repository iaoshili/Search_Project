{"Main text":"The art and science of selling clothes to bros\nHow a new wave of retailers are getting normal guys to shop online\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe menswear community on Tumblr is positively bustling. In the last 30 days, more than 77,000 photos, text posts, and videos were posted with the #Menswear tag, according to Union Metrics. There are posts by Nick Wooster , a street-fashion icon;  Fuck Yeah Menswear, which spawned a book; and even Menswear Dog, a Shiba Inu that dons a variety of well-put-together outfits, and who has garnered more than 60,000 followers  on Instagram . Ten years ago, most men, let alone dogs wouldn't have been caught dead sporting an ascot, but today, the desire to be fashionable has reached critical mass.\nTen years ago most men, let alone dogs, wouldn't have been caught dead sporting an ascot\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when the spike in interest in men\u2019s fashion occurred, but with that spike came a dozen new websites aiming to sell clothes to men \u2014 men who have traditionally been stubborn about shopping for clothing online.  JackThreads was one of the first, which opened its doors in 2008 not just to fashion-savvy men, but also to regular guys. \"Retail always focused on the female shopper,\" says founder Jason Ross. \"I didn\u2019t feel like there were any retailers out there thinking about guys.\" But selling to guys brings its own set of challenges, since men often shop differently than women.\nTo Michael Preysman, it begins with the male psyche. He\u2019s the founder of  Everlane , an online retailer that sells designer-quality basics like oxfords and T-shirts to men by sourcing its own factories,. \"\u2018Is this my new shirt?\u2019 men ask,\" according to Preysman. \"\u2018Do I want to buy all my button-downs from here?\u2019\" Men often look to find the best shirt or pair of pants for their dollar, and then buy a bunch of them, he says. \"It\u2019s a hunting mentality,\" says Preysman. \"Once you find that good spot, you say \u2018Fuck it, I\u2019m going to get everything from here.\u2019\" Thus, Everlane created what it calls The Perfect Tee and has spun up an appealing story to help sell it.\nHe cites The Sartorialist, a blog documenting street fashions, as one of the pioneering places to catalyze the online menswear revolution back in 2005. Today, he says, threads about the stitches per inch in a men\u2019s shirt can go pages deep on StyleForum or Reddit, two popular destinations for debating men\u2019s fashion. These discussions aren\u2019t just about \"metro\" fashion trends as one might expect, says Preysman, but about fine details in clothesmaking. \"Metro was the idea, but that\u2019s not as much what\u2019s happening,\" says Preysman. \"Design-centric guys think about good quality stuff.\" One New York-based retailer named In God We Trust gave itself this bold tagline: \"Pride builds quality, quality builds pride.\"\nOne of the ways to communicate quality is transparency. Online retailer  Outlier , for example, provides detailed dossiers on its products, explaining how they were made and providing scientific descriptions of the high-tech, self-cleaning Swiss fabric used. \"Being online means that people can do super extensive research, and then when they want to buy, the process can be extremely clean and smooth,\" says Outlier co-founder Abe Burmeister. In a brick-and-mortar store, it\u2019s easier to walk out with a pair of pants, but harder to nail down \"the specs\" for any article of clothing, like where it was made, what fabric is used, and if it was ethically manufactured. If anything, Burmeister says, an online shopping experience offers men the ability to research a coat the same way they might research a new TV on a site like The Wirecutter. The effect is that you feel like you\u2019re getting your money\u2019s worth.\n\"Metro was the idea, but that\u2019s not as much what\u2019s happening.\"\nA photo of Everlane\u2019s latest oxford shirt design, another example, is flanked by the following description of the factory where the shirt was made: \"Located in Hangzhou, China \u2014 known as one of the country\u2019s most beautiful cities \u2014 we last visited this factory in January. We landed here in late 2011, the result of a long search for the best silk factory.\" Presyman says, \"It\u2019s about telling a detailed story, helping people understand why it\u2019s a good product \u2014 from the fabric to story of the dyes used \u2014 men love the detail and history behind a product.\"\n\"Men\u2019s shopping offline was just such a crappy experience,\" says Burmeister. \"It just wasn\u2019t tuned to how many men like to shop, which is in a bit of an all-or-nothing style.\" In its efforts to account for men\u2019s shopping habits, online retailer  Frank & Oak has come up with an ingenious, albeit risky, scheme. As part of the site\u2019s \"Hunt Club\" free membership, Frank & Oak will mail you a box of clothes you\u2019ve picked out once a month. You can pay for what you want to keep, or you can just send everything back entirely free of charge. Frank & Oak is betting that once you\u2019ve tried on and liked a shirt or pair of pants in the comfort of your home, you\u2019re far more likely to keep it. Meanwhile, the company eats the shipping cost.\n\"Lots of guys care about looking good, but not necessarily about shopping,\" says Frank & Oak co-founder Ethan Song. His company both designs and markets its own products to keep costs down, but it also introduced an innovative way to customize the site\u2019s selection for your tastes. When you log in for the first time to Frank & Oak, \"StyleScape\" asks \"Which style guru inspires you most: John F. Kennedy, Don Draper, or Bob Dylan?\" The answer to this question, among others, helps Frank & Oak recommend specific items to you, which means you might spend less time scrolling through an endless grid of shirts. On a site like  Bonobos , you might even be thrown into a bucket like \"metrosexual or gay,\" \"finance guy,\" or \"hipster.\" Or, you can just head into one of Bonobos\u2019 handful of \"Guideshops\" to get more personal recommendations and try on the company\u2019s clothes in person \u2014 a hedge against the biggest advantage brick-and-mortar retailers have: shoppers who prefer to see and touch the items they\u2019re buying before taking the the plunge.\n\"A lot of guys say \u2018Can you help me pick out five items that are great for me and I\u2019ll be done?\u2019\" Song says. For some online retailers, fitting shoppers into specific molds can be one secret to success that brick-and-mortar stores can\u2019t easily match. Another element is a tight mobile experience, which has led JackThreads to double-digit millions in sales on mobile alone. The menswear industry is expected to rake in $139 billion per year by 2017 , and an increasing portion could be from online sites \u2014 places better catered to the way men, and perhaps even menswear dogs, shop today.\n","Title":"The art and science of selling clothes to bros | The Verge","Tags":["web","report","design","tech"]}
