{"Main text":"I don't want a zoom lens on my phone\nFeature creep could ruin something great\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSome things will always sound better in theory than practice, but nowhere is this more true than the show floors of CES. Take Asus\u2019 new smartphone with an optical zoom lens : you don\u2019t want a zoom lens on your camera. It\u2019s an example of gratuitous feature creep that might just rob us of something great.\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you for disagreeing at first \u2014 on paper, a legitimate zoom lens sounds like an objective improvement to one of the most important things that the most important device in our lives performs. After all, digital zoom is nothing more than a quality-degrading crop. But it\u2019s worth thinking about how and why we use our phone cameras. Apple often notes that its iPhones are the most popular cameras in the world, which means its lenses  \u2014  prime lenses  \u2014  are the most popular in the world as well. The rise of smartphone photography is the resurrection of the prime lens.\nFor cameras with swappable lenses, \"prime\" refers to any glass that doesn\u2019t zoom. In general, prime lenses aren\u2019t really understood by people that don\u2019t buy expensive cameras; zoom was a standard feature on entry-level models long before digital cameras were a thing. But there are lots of reasons why enthusiasts often prefer primes, even when given the option. Primes can be really compact, for example. They usually allow for sharper images. And they can be designed with wider apertures, meaning better low-light performance and creative control over attractive blurry backgrounds. All of this is important for smartphone design, which involves cramming things into as small a space as possible. All things being equal, a prime will usually get you better image quality or a smaller lens. Often both.\nAsus hasn\u2019t given demos of its Zenfone Zoom at CES; the phone is only on show behind glass. But a look at the spec sheet reveals the compromises the company has had to make. Its 3x optical zoom lens starts with an aperture of f\/2.7 at its widest angle, closing down to f\/4.8 when zoomed in all the way. f\/2.7 is already a little slow by smartphone standards \u2014 the iPhone 6 is f\/2.2, for example \u2014 but the f\/4.8 figure means the phone will capture around 150 percent less light at the long end, requiring longer shutter speeds to compensate. Don\u2019t expect the Zenfone Zoom to be much use in dark situations \u2014 and that\u2019s before we get into the likelihood of distortion, aberrations, and general sharpness issues that plague cheap zoom lenses. To say nothing of the gigantic bulge on the phone\u2019s back.\nThe rise of smartphone photography is the resurrection of the prime lens\nBut let\u2019s say the technical limitations are surpassable \u2014 they probably aren\u2019t any time soon, but for the sake of argument \u2014 even then, I\u2019d still prefer a prime. To me, zoom lenses are for business, not pleasure. Primes force you to think about perspective and composition instead of using a zoom\u2019s reach as a crutch. As often as not, zooms are a barrier between you and your photograph; just another thing to think about before pressing the shutter. The iPhone\u2019s success as a camera owes at least as much to its speedy, reliable, predictable operation as its image quality.\nI like taking pictures with prime lenses for the same reason I like taking pictures with my iPhone. I brought just one camera and lens with me to CES this week \u2014 Fujifilm\u2019s X100T, which has a fixed 35mm-equivalent prime \u2014 because years of lugging excessive gear around have resulted in little more than back strain and missed photo opportunities while swapping optics. I\u2019ve borrowed DSLRs to use for liveblogging press conferences, because that\u2019s a situation that really does need a zoom lens, but it\u2019s been a last resort. It\u2019s that business versus pleasure thing.\nEven with a prime lens, you still have ways to expand your shooting options. Fujifilm\u2019s X100 cameras have wide and telephoto lens converters that don\u2019t compromise on quality. This week, I\u2019ve also been testing Olloclip\u2019s upcoming 2x telephoto conversion lens for the iPhone 6, which is a pretty neat way to get a zoomed-in perspective. And the ubiquitous selfie stick is now the world\u2019s most mainstream substitute for a wide-angle lens.\nStill, if your phone is your only camera, I can see why you\u2019d want it to zoom in theory. It\u2019d help you get shots that just aren\u2019t possible right now out of the box. But I\u2019ve found myself taking pictures on my phone even when I have a far \"better\" camera around my neck, and its fixed lens is a big part of the reason why: it performs well and remains fun to use. Adding zoom at this point would compromise both.\n","Title":"I don't want a zoom lens on my phone | The Verge","Tags":["photography","mobile","editorial","tech","ces-2015"]}
