{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSure,  not everyone agreed with Beck's Morning Phase winning the Grammy for best album of 2014. But even those who agreed with Kanye and thought Beyoncé's self-titled release should have taken album of the year honors would probably admit Morning Phase is  a release worth of praise . If you haven't heard it yet (and I highly recommend you do), Google Play is by far the best place to go get it: right now, Google's music store is holding a sale, and the album will only cost you a scant 99 cents. (That's less than buying any single track on its own.)\nGoogle's also offering Drake's 2010 release Thank Me Later and Daft Punk's 2001 album Discovery for that same 99-cent price point, and a few dozen other albums are going for between $5.99 and $7.99. There's a number of classics like Nirvana's In Utero, Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, Michael Jackson's Thriller, and Kanye's The College Dropout alongside some newer releases like Sucker by Charli XCX, Turn Blue by The Black Keys, and Bastille's Bad Blood. If you still like to actually own your music rather than stream it, Google Play's Birthday sale probably has at least a few things you'll be interested in checking out.\n","Title":"Beck's Grammy-winning Morning Phase is on sale for only a buck on Google Play | The Verge","Tags":["culture","good-deals","entertainment","music"]}
