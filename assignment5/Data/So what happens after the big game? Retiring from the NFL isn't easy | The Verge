Retiring from the NFL isn't easy\nHere are all the ways athletes' lives are destabilized when they leave sports\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSeattle defensive tackle Kevin Williams will consider retiring after the big game on Sunday,Â  reports azcentral . With 12 NFL seasons under his belt, the 34-year-old is quite literally an old pro now. But retiring from the NFL, or any high performance sport, isn\u2019t easy. A lot of obstacles can come up as players transition into \"normal life\" \u2014 a life they\u2019ve technically never had.\nMissing the game, the identity\nNFL players take huge risks simply by playing. Because of the hits they suffer, retirees who start playing tackle football before the age of 12 have a higher risk of developing memory and thinking problems later in life, according to a study of 42 NFL players published yesterday in Neurology. NFL players also show signs of arthritis far earlier than the average male. These issues tend to pop up later in life, however \u2014 long after they\u2019ve moved on from the NFL. In the meantime, they\u2019ve had to adapt to living like a \"regular person,\" and that transition doesn\u2019t always happen smoothly. After all, building a whole new identify for yourself can get really weird, really fast.\n\"The only times I got the \u2018energy\u2019 that I wanted to play \u2014 to be involved or be on the field \u2014 was during a big Monday night game versus a rivalry, or a big playoff game,\" says Earnest Byner, a former NFL player and coach who caught a touchdown pass for Washington in the 1992 Super Bowl championship game.\nWhen Byner stopped playing football in 1997, he was relieved. But after a few months, he started to miss it. Seeing players doing what he once did so well made him feel \"nervous,\" he says. But that feeling quickly dissipated;  coaching was enough. He thinks he\u2019s different from a lot of other players, however, and he considers himself lucky. \"I guess I\u2019m blessed to be able to have the mentality that I have,\" Byner says, \"being able to adjust and move on to the next life.\"\n\"There are a few things to keep in mind with high performance athletes,\" says Matt Johnson, a sports psychologist who has worked with college football players and NFL athletes. The first is whether or not leaving the sport was the player\u2019s own decision. Did they get cut from the team? Did an injury get in the way? Did they make it to the Super Bowl? If they achieved their goals and then left, that can make the transition a lot easier, Johnson says. When a player gets cut because of an injury, or simply because they\u2019re aren\u2019t playing the way they once did, that can have big implications for a player\u2019s mental health. \"I work with several professional athletes who retired after an injury,\" says Anne Smith, a psychologist and a former Wimbledon tennis champion, \"and what I hear mostly from them is that it's hard to be at home all the time.\"\n\"If they are leaving by force, then a sense of control is being taken away from them,\" Johnson says. And losing control often leads to frustration, anger, and depression.\nBut even the decision to leave isn\u2019t as important to an athlete\u2019s transition as the strength of their \"player Identity,\" says Nicole Detling, a sports psychologist at the University of Utah who worked with Olympic athletes. \"'Who am I once that I am no longer a football player?\u2019 is hard question to answer for many players.\" If all they\u2019ve ever experienced is the athlete\u2019s identity, leaving that life behind can be unsettling, says Mustafa Sarkar, a sports psychologist at the University of Gloucestershire in the UK who has studied perseverance in Olympic athletes. \"So my recommendation from a psychology perspective is for them to have multiple identities, not purely about their sport.\"\n\"Once they have an identity away from the field \u2014 whether it\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m a dad,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a businessperson,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a husband\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s when they can start to understand that they still value away from the field,\" Detling says. But even then, it\u2019s hard to find fulfillment somewhere else, Smith says. \"When athletes are playing in front of hundred of thousands of people\u2026 You can\u2019t replace that feeling \u2014 it's difficult.\"\nPhilip Robertston, Flickr\nDepression and anxiety isn\u2019t just a problem for NFL players, of course; anxiety disorders can arise in all professional sports. Combine that with the fact that intensive exercise is very addictive , and you end up with a population that\u2019s likely to experience any number of mental health issues once they leave sports. And when these issues arise, some retired athletes seek out substances that can replace the \"high\" they used to get from physical activity.\n\"A lot of retired athletes report fairly significant mental health concerns and an increased level of substance dependence,\" Frances Quirk, co-editor-in-chief of the journal Performance Enhancement & Health, told Bloomberg in 2012 .\nIsolation and overeating\nEven the most well-rounded retired athletes \u2014 those who already know who they are outside of sports \u2014 can feel isolated. \"A lot of NFL teams really emphasize the idea of the team as the family, and that\u2019s not something you will do in a cubicle,\" Detling says. So if a player moves to the corporate world, they might start to wonder about who will have their back. Building a support system outside of football can make a huge difference, Sarkar says, but athletes \"really struggle to come to terms with losing that kind of friendship or bond with teammates.\"\nMany players also have to deal with chronic pain. \"If you look at a lot of the research, NFL player\u2019s bodies are so broken down after the sport,\" that many need to take pain medication and undergo surgery, Detling says. So even those who want to remain active don\u2019t always have the luxury of doing so.\nMoney can also be a huge source of concern. The average NFL player makes $1.9 million a year, but players don\u2019t always have a plan for what to do with the amounts they\u2019ve amassed after the NFL. Those who aren\u2019t financially savvy, or those who aren\u2019t sure what to do with their lives after football, can run into trouble, which adds to their stress.\nSome problems are less obvious, however. \"The thing that has been the challenge is trying to eat right,\" Byner says. \"I kept eating and I would go back and forth. My weight would fluctuate.\" This problem is pretty typical, Detling says. Many players are so used to consuming large amounts of calories on a daily basis that they have trouble figuring out what\u2019s a reasonable amount as they become less active. \"They can get really unhealthy and blow up\" because they\u2019re still eating the way they did when they were working out all day, or because they\u2019re stress eating, she says. When that happens, players are on their own; they have to learn how to live without coaches who are constantly telling them what to do and eat.\n\"I had to become more disciplined [with food],\" Byner says. \"It\u2019s a challenge even though I was working out.\"\nEvery player is different, however, so it\u2019s anybody guess as to how Williams will fare after his retirement \u2014 whenever that may be. \"Some players go through the transition really well,\" Detling says. It just depends on how well they\u2019ve prepared. Educating athletes and managing their expectations around that is crucial, Sarkar says. Some will still find retirement difficult, but understanding what they might go through and why can go a long way. \"So when they do come across those situations,\" Sarkar says, \"it\u2019s not so impactful as if they didn\u2019t know anything at all about the potential negative effects of retiring from their sport.\"\nVerge Video: Can a Concussion Sensor Help Save Athletes' Lives?
