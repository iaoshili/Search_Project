{"Main text":"Ai Weiwei is starring in a sci-fi short that needs your funding\nChina's foremost artist is making his acting debut\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPerhaps China's most prominent artist, Ai Weiwei's diverse body of work includes sculpture, architectural installations, photography, and documentary films. For a new Kickstarter project Ai will appear on the other side of the camera, as an actor taking the leading role in a 10-minute sci-fi short. Set in \"the not-too-distant future,\" the film stars Ai as a smuggler in a world without water. Called The Sand Storm, the film was shot by cinematographer Christopher Doyle \u2014 who won multiple awards including the Cannes Grand Technical Prize for his work with Wong Kar Wai on In the Mood for Love and 2046 and directed by Jason Wishnow, who previously created TED Talks.\nFilming took place secretly in Beijing, which Wishnow puts down to the intense surveillance of Ai by Chinese authorities.  \"When the air is toxic and your lead actor is under surveillance, you make a short film and you shoot it fast.\" Although Wishnow and his colleagues have finished shooting, the director says he needs $33,000 to complete the 10-minute film. The crowdfunded cash will go towards visual effects, sound design, music, subtitles, and other production costs. Should the campaign reach its funding goal, the team are targeting a June release for backers.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
