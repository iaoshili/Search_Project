{"Main text":"Walmart goes after Chromecast with $25 Vudu Spark\nYou get what you pay for\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWalmart thinks it can out-price the Google Chromecast, Roku Streaming Stick, and Amazon Fire TV Stick. The mega retailer has quietly put out its very own streaming device, called the Vudu Spark, and it costs just a meagre $24.95, a Walmart representative  tells Gigaom . And there's a currently a promotion that will effectively make the device free \u2014 Walmart will give you $25 in movie credits over five months when you purchase the streaming stick. The device first leaked from the FCC in November.\nBut you do get what you pay for. Unlike the $35 Chromecast or its other, more expensive competitors, there's no Netflix or Hulu. There's no HBO Go. In fact, there are no apps whatsoever. All the Vudu Spark can do is play streaming videos from Vudu, the Walmart-owned site that rents TV shows and movies. It also comes with a traditional remote.\nNevertheless, with Walmart's considerable muscle behind it, the Vudu Spark could end up finding its way into a number of homes across the country. And since the device only serves as a portal for customers to spend money renting videos from Vudu, Walmart likely doesn't care if it loses money selling the sticks.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
