{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nResponding to an  Automobile Magazine report that Ford is prepping a mass-market electric car that will run over 200 miles between charges, Ford says they've got it all wrong: \"We do not comment on speculation but can confirm these reports are not accurate,\" a spokesperson tells The Verge. By all appearances, the announcement \u2014 which would happen this year, Automobile had claimed \u2014 would go head-to-head with  Chevy's Bolt and the upcoming  Model 3 from Tesla, both of which are designed to hit the market well under $40,000. (Ford currently offers the  Focus Electric , but its range is just 76 miles \u2014 not practical as an all-purpose vehicle outside urban centers.)\nIt could compete with the Bolt and the Model 3\nLegacy automakers are racing to meet stricter US emissions standards that are scheduled to go into effect between model years 2017 and 2025; by the middle of the next decade, vehicles will be required to average nearly 55 miles per gallon across the model range, which will require some aggressive moves toward alternative powertrains and full electrics. The problem today is that practical high-range electrics like Tesla's Model S are too expensive for the mass market \u2014 and that's where cars like the Model 3 and Bolt come into play.\nAutomobile had pegged November's LA Auto Show as the likely stage for Ford's launch, but the New York Auto Show \u2014 coming up in early April \u2014 could have been an outside possibility.\nUpdate March 3rd 6:40 PM ET: Ford has responded to Automobile's report, calling it \"not accurate.\" Our story has been reflected to incorporate Ford's statement.\n","Title":"Ford refutes report that it will announce an electric car with 200-mile-plus range this year | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
