{"Main text":"Robinhood lets you trade stocks for free on your iPhone\nA next-generation brokerage is now open for business\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast year, a mobile stock brokerage named  Robinhood opened to a small number of beta testers. At a time when most brokerages charge $7 to $10 for stock trades, Robinhood offered those trades for free. Its elegant mobile app for iPhone was built to appeal to a younger generation of investors, who would never pick up the phone to call a broker but might happily buy stocks if it could be done in just a few taps.\nThe pitch proved irresistible to the half a million people who signed up on Robinhood\u2019s waiting list, and the company has  raised $16 million from investors including Index Ventures, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. Today, Robinhood is officially  opening for business \u2014 the company is rolling out access to everyone who signs up over the next couple of weeks.\nBuy and sells stocks for free, with just a few taps\nI\u2019m no stock trader, but there's plenty to like about Robinhood\u2019s app. A dead-simple interface lets you buy and sell stocks with a minimum of taps, and no fees. Elegant charts show you a stock\u2019s performance over time; in a nice touch; the color of the sparkline changes from red to green when the markets are open. The app\u2019s home screen shows you the performance of your entire portfolio.\nSo now anyone can actively manage their own stock portfolio \u2014 but whether you should is another story. Most studies of investor performance suggest the average person is far better off investing in index funds, which tend to track the market\u2019s overall performance, than in individual stocks. Most people can\u2019t time their trades well enough to take advantage of a stock\u2019s highs and lows; one oft-cited academic paper on the subject is titled \" Trading Can Be Hazardous to Your Wealth .\" (Its study of 66,465 households found that heavy traders earned an annual return of 11.4 percent, compared to the market\u2019s returns of 17.9 percent.)\nAn Android version is coming\nRobinhood\u2019s founders say that one reason investors tend to underperform the market is that they pay substantial fees to brokerages, which Robinhood largely eliminates. Instead, the company charges for the ability to buy stocks on \"margin,\" or credit, and also makes money by collecting interest on users\u2019 cash balances. It also plans to offer premium advisory services.\nThe lack of transaction fees may tempt you to make a lot of trades, but Robinhood's founders say they don't encourage any particular strategy. \"We by no means promote just an active investing strategy, or just a passive one,\" says Baiju Bhatt, a Robinhood co-founder. \"I think the ideal strategy is to do a little bit of both.\" Bhatt suggests investors consider putting 70 percent of their money into diversified securities like index funds and actively manage the rest.\nActively managing a stock portfolio brings on some risk, but millions of Americans do it already. And much of the existing mobile software on the market falls somewhere in between hideous and unusable. An Android version of Robinhood is coming in the first half of next year, and the company is also working on an API that would bring its trading functionality to other apps. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re already making stock trades on your iPhone, Robinhood is well worth a look. And if you\u2019re not, it might just get you hooked.\n","Title":"Robinhood lets you trade stocks for free on your iPhone | The Verge","Tags":["apps","report","business","tech"]}
