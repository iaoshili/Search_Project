{"Main text":"Every line of dialogue from the new Furious 7 trailer, explained\nIn-depth analysis from a Fast & Furious aficionado\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you don't have an encyclopedic knowledge of Fast & Furious locked away in your brain \u2014 or, heaven forbid, you haven't seen any movies in the series \u2014 there may have been moments in  yesterday's Super Bowl trailer for Furious 7 that didn't make a lot of sense. That's okay: as America's self-declared foremost authority on the franchise, I got you. I'm here to lay out exactly what happened, line by line.\n\"The most important thing in life will always be family. The people right here, right now.\"\nDom, played by national treasure Vin Diesel, is really into family. It's to the point where basically everyone he knows is sucked into his ever-expanding constellation of non-genetic brothers, sisters, cousins, and so on. At least once per movie, Dom drives home the importance of family. He would die for these people.\n\"Dominic Toretto. You don't know me. You're about to.\"\nOh, man. This is the central bad guy of Furious 7, Deckard Shaw, played by legendary British badass Jason Statham. He's super pissed because his brother Owen was killed in the last movie  in one of the most insane action scenes ever filmed . Looks like he's about to serve Dom (and the rest of his family) an extra-extra-large helping of pain.\n\"Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.\"\nThis is Dom commenting on Deckard Shaw's ominous warning (see above). It's a reference to  Fast & Furious 6 , which partly took place in London. I don't know if I'd call them \"sins,\" though; Dominic Toretto is one of the purest human beings on the planet. All he wants in the world is to keep his family safe. Is that a sin?\n\"Remember Owen Shaw? This is his big, bad brother.\"\nThis is the first commentary in the trailer that we get from Hobbs, the supernaturally swole human being played by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. \"Big, bad brother\" appears to be an accurate description. Statham plays a criminal with a heart of gold in some of his other films, but by all appearances, he's just a straight-up bad guy in Furious 7.\nTej: \"We're being hunted.\"\nBrian: \"I'm coming with you.\"\nTej (Ludacris) notes, accurately, that Owen Shaw is hunting Dom's crew. Brian is going somewhere with Tej.\n\"One last ride.\"\nI'm pretty sure Dom has been saying \"one last ride\" in every movie since the first, except for the second one and Tokyo Drift because he's not in those. (Well, he's sort of in Tokyo Drift, but not really.) Let me be clear: it's never the last ride. I think they write it into the script just in case they decide they don't want to make more Fast & Furious movies, but they always do.\n\"Daddy's gotta go to work.\"\nIn perhaps the trailer's most dramatic and unfathomably badass scene, Hobbs decides that he needs to go do something awesome, and so he literally flexes his jacked-up arm out of a cast and starts firing a gun the size of a large dog. We don't see him actually break the cast in the Super Bowl spot, but when it happened in  last fall's trailer , I jumped out of my seat, flailed my arms, and made a guttural howling sound.\n\"This takes crazy to a whole 'nother level.\"\nRoman (Tyrese Gibson) is the squad's worry wart, naysaying almost every idea the team comes up with before eventually getting dragged into it, kicking and screaming. His warning usually takes the form of \"we've done crazy stuff, but this is over the line, and I do not wish to participate.\" By all appearances, he will reprise this role in Furious 7.\nHave I mentioned that I'm excited for this film?\n","Title":"Every line of dialogue from the new Furious 7 trailer, explained | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment","transportation"]}
