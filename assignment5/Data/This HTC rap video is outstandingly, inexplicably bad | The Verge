{"Main text":"This HTC rap video is outstandingly, inexplicably bad\n'We own the universe, your galaxy is overrated.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHTC likes to bill itself as an underdog, a small company that makes superior smartphones with a humility befitting its Quietly Brilliant tagline. All that modesty has been thrown away this week, however, by what might be the new champion of atrociously bad corporate music videos. The two-minute \"Hold The Crown\" anthem packs a remarkable density of woeful jokes and half-rhymes, mocking Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S5 in a style that's intentionally goofy, but also entirely unfunny. If there's a joke here, it's at HTC's own expense: the company comes across as petty and confrontational. Some of it doesn't even make sense, such as the line saying, \"It took you copycats six times to get it right,\" which implies HTC's approval of the iPhone 6's design.\nWe didn't think thatÂ  BlackBerry's cover of REO Speedwagon would ever be topped for inducing a cringing unease in a tech audience, but HTC has clearly surpassed the achievements of its Canadian competitor. To top it all off, there's an interview with the author of the rap, Doc G , which is conducted by \"HTC's own D 2 tha B\" and elevates the awkwardness quotient to a whole new level.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
