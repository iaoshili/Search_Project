{"Main text":"District 9 director Neill Blomkamp is helming a new Alien movie after all\nAnd no, it's not Prometheus 2\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDistrict 9 and Elysium director Neill Blomkamp drew attention last month when he posted a series of concept art images from a new Alien movie he was working on without authorization from any studio. Although at the time he wistfully suggested the movie \"woulda rocked,\" it now looks like the project might actually come to fruition \u2014 a new Instagram post from the director reads, \"Um... so I think it's officially my next film.\"\nVariety reports separately that Blomkamp has a deal with 20th Century Fox to direct the movie, which will be a different project altogether to Fox's Prometheus sequel with Ridley Scott.  According to The Wrap , the untitled Blomkamp movie will be produced by Scott and take place after the events of Prometheus 2.\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nFeb 18, 2015 at 3:55pm PST\nAlthough little is known about the project, Blomkamp clearly has reverence for the Alien series, which unfortunately lost its way in more recent entries. Last month, on Twitter, he praised Creative Assembly's atmospheric, authentic Alien Isolation video game as having \"disgustingly awesome\" production design.\nproduction design in @AlienIsolation is disgustingly awesome. hats off @CAGames\n\u2014 Neill Blomkamp (@NeillBlomkamp) January 14, 2015\nHere's some more of the concept art previously posted by Blomkamp:\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:30pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:32pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:40pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:49pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 5:56pm PST\nA photo posted by Brownsnout (@neillblomkamp) on\nJan 1, 2015 at 6:06pm PST\n","Title":"District 9 director Neill Blomkamp is helming a new Alien movie after all | The Verge","Tags":["culture","breaking","entertainment"]}
