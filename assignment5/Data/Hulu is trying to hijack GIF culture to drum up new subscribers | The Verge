{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHulu has launched a new website for sharing GIFs from its TV shows. The Tumblr-hosted site  The Perfect GIF contains more than 1,400 animated snippets created by Hulu's staff, with the GIFs sorted by different actions, reactions, and shows. There are easy sharing and reblogging buttons on hand, with Hulu apparently trying to capitalize on the revival of the format by giving internet users an easily browsable catalog of GIFs, quietly reminding them that if they like these shows, they can always buy a Hulu subscription.\nall the gifs are branded with the show and network's logos\nAs a marketing stunt, The Perfect GIF has been pretty neatly implemented, but there are a few corporate touches that will be off-putting for some internet users. For a start, the GIFs are all branded with a Hulu hashtag in the bottom right corner, and the individual show's logo and network in the left. This makes sense if, like Hulu, you want to advertise a GIF's provenance, but it looks out of place among the fan-created memes on Tumblr and Twitter.\nSimilarly, the social buttons for Tumblr, Twitter, and Pinterest underneath each GIF are accompanied by a disclaimer warning users: \"By clicking any of the below, you agree to [Hulu's] Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\" These terms and conditions are all boiler plate stuff \u2014 protecting copyrights and trademarks, etc \u2014 but they're an unwelcome reminder that this is not a fan-driven project. This is also evident from the choppy frame-rate on a lot of the GIFs \u2014 fans would presumably know better. #Awkward.\n","Title":"Hulu is trying to hijack GIF culture to drum up new subscribers | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture"]}
