{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI just spent  $10 on Duet Display to turn my aging iPad into a secondary MacBook display. That\u2019s about five times more than I\u2019d normally consider prudent for an app, but it was worth every penny.\nI\u2019ve been a daily iPad-as-secondary-display user for years. My go-to app had always been Air Display (and then Air Display 2). That just changed. For the same price as Air Display 2 I\u2019m able to ditch the unstable Wi-Fi connection typical to these remote display apps and extend my workspace over an old 30-pin USB cable. That's given new life to my three-year-old MacBook Air and three-year-old iPad 2. No stutters, no lag, and it's surprisingly robust enough to support video playback. Duet says its app was developed by a team of ex-Apple engineers, and it definitely seems to benefit from this expertise.\nAfter getting past the price, setting up Duet was painless. I was up and running in five minutes after first downloading the app from the iOS App Store and then installing the free companion app on my MacBook Air (and rebooting). Duet found the iPad just as soon as I connected the USB cable. The company claims it can deliver a retina display at 60 frames per second with no lag. That might be true, but I\u2019m running in energy saving mode at 30 fps, and I\u2019m still able to  watch Kim Jong-un\u2019s head explode with glorious fluidity while working from this cafe. Sure, my set-up is nerdy as hell but any embarrassment is offset by my increased productivity, so the choice is a real no-brainer.\n","Title":"Duet turned my old iPad into a fast MacBook display | The Verge","Tags":["apps","hands--on","tech"]}
