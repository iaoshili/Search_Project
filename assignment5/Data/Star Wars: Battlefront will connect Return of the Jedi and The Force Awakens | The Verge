{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere at Star Wars Celebration, EA is showing off its upcoming game Star Wars: Battlefront, and we  really like what we\u2019ve seen thus far . But while the game largely exists in the world of the original trilogy, a free piece of downloadable content announced today will connect J.J. Abrams\u2019 film with the originals in a very direct way \u2014 and gives us some new clues about the world of The Force Awakens.\nThe Empire and the Rebels met for a pivotal battle after Endor\nOne of the reveals during yesterday\u2019s panel was that the sandy planet seen in the teasers isn\u2019t Luke\u2019s home of Tatooine, but rather a world called Jakku. It\u2019s where Daisy Ridley\u2019s character Rey lives, and in the new trailer a downed Star Destroyer and X-Wing fighter can be seen off in the distance. If that seems like evidence of a great battle, that\u2019s because it is. According to Battlefront design director Niklas Fegraeus, who previewed the game to the press yesterday, after the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi the Rebel Alliance and the Empire met up again for a final \"pivotal\" showdown that shaped the future of the galaxy. That massive fight was the Battle of Jakku \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be playable in Battlefront as a free download.\nEA DICE kept additional details about the fight itself under wraps, but the Battle of Jakku certainly starts to give things some larger context (such as why Rey is a scavenger in the first place; it's a logical gig if you're able to scour ship wreckage all day long). The playable battle will be available on December 1st for those that pre-order the game. Everybody else will have to wait until December 8th \u2014 Battlefront itself is scheduled for release on November 17th. Either way, it should give you plenty of time to check out one of the final skirmishes between the evil Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance \u2014 just in time to set the stage for The Force Awakens.\nStar Wars: Battlefront: Hoth teaser trailer\n","Title":"Star Wars: Battlefront will connect Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment","film\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
