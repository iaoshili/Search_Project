{"Main text":"Sony offering discounts and subscription extensions after PSN outage\nGamers can take 10 percent off a transaction and get five more days of PlayStation Plus\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter  a massive cyber attack took down the PlayStation network over the holidays, Sony is trying to make good with gamers: the company announced  in a blog post that it will extend subscriptions for premium users and offer discounts on purchases for everyone affected.\nSony will offer 10 percent off one transaction\nThe outage, apparently the result of an organized denial-of-service attack that also shut down Xbox Live, kept players off PSN for days. If you signed up for a PlayStation Plus account before the December 25th attack, Sony will extend your subscription an extra five days.  \"We will post additional information here on PlayStation.Blog when the extension becomes available,\" the blog post reads. \"If your membership or trial ends before the extension is available, you will receive five days of Plus to enjoy once the extension becomes available (we will notify you when).\"\nFor everyone else inconvenienced by the outage, Sony will be sending out 10-percent-off discount codes later this month. The codes will be applicable on all items in a single transaction.\nIn 2011, after an even more serious hack, Sony offered  free games and discounts to users. The company also  settled a class-action lawsuit after that outage. Although Xbox Live recovered more quickly from the attack than PSN, it remains to be seen if Microsoft follows suit.\n","Title":"Sony offering discounts and subscription extensions after PSN outage | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","tech"]}
