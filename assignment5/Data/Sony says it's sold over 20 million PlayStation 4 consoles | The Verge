{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony is sounding a triumphant note today, announcing that worldwide PlayStation 4 sales have exceeded 20.2 million as of March 1st. The company's latest console is in a strong position as it continues to battle Xbox One and Nintendo's sagging Wii U. \"We are so grateful for the enormous support from PlayStation fans worldwide, and we are truly humbled that gamers around the globe have continued to select PS4 as the best place to play,\" said Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Andrew House.\nAlong with the sales figures, Sony is pointing to a strong upcoming game lineup as an indicator that its momentum should continue right along. Not all of the console's exclusives have been standouts, however.  The Order: 1886 has been praised for its unrivaled console graphics but slammed for a boring, last-gen gameplay experience.\nMicrosoft last reported overall Xbox One shipments in November. Back then, the console had just surpassed 10 million units, though it's no doubt tacked on millions more since then. Microsoft executives have hinted at a strong holiday quarter \u2014 the  Xbox One outsold PS4 in the US during both November and December \u2014 but admit there's more to be done to keep pace with and ultimately place ahead of PlayStation. But Sony, which  now holds the PlayStation business in higher regard than ever before, won't idly stand by to see that happen. We're still early in this console race.\n","Title":"Sony says it's sold over 20 million PlayStation 4 consoles | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","hd-home","tech","gdc-2015"]}
