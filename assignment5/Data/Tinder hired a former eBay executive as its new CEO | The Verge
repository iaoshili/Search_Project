{"Main text":"Tinder hired a former eBay executive as its new CEO\nHe might want to work on fixing Tinder Plus\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen you think \"Tinder CEO,\" a former eBay executive probably isn't the first thing that comes to mind. But that's the direction the swipe-based dating app is now taking.  Recode is reporting that Chris Payne has been hired to replace co-founder and outgoing CEO Sean Rad, who led the IAC-owned app as it catapulted in popularity over the last few years. Payne has already begun work at the company, according to the report, though Sean Rad isn't going anywhere. He'll remain with Tinder as president and oversee decisions around product and marketing.\nRecently, Tinder made a dramatic shift in strategy with the launch of Tinder Plus , a paid tier that allows users to undo a swipe in the wrong direction or change their location to view singles in other regions. But with the change, Tinder has received scathing reviews across both the iOS App Store and Google Play for putting an arbitrary limit on \"likes\" and charging older users more money than younger swipers for the same features. The app currently holds a 1.5-star rating on the App Store, and reviews aren't pretty; many accuse IAC and Tinder of ruining what was once a social phenomenon. So, it's a rough time for Payne to make an entrance \u2014 but there's really not much he could do to make things worse at the moment.\n","Title":"Tinder hired a former eBay executive as its new CEO | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
