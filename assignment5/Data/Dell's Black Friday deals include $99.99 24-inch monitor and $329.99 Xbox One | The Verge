Yes, the company is offering extremely inexpensive Windows laptops, desktops, and Android tablets, but they're not really devices that we'd be able to solidly recommend. The 27-inch monitor may be worth a look if you don't plan on gaming with it, and the 24-inch 1080p monitor is probably worth staying up late for at a price of just $99.99.\nIf you're looking for a PlayStation 4, this is probably the best place to get it. Dell will offer the PS4 with Grand Theft Auto V and The Last of Us: Remastered for the console's regular price of $399.99. But to get that, you'll likely need to excuse yourself from Thanksgiving dinner; the PS4 be available in limited quantities at 6PM on Thursday, November 27th. Still, it beats fighting lines at other retailers for the same deal.\nThe Xbox One bundle is also a decent deal. For less than the console alone, you get two Assassin's Creed titles thrown in. Some of the TVs Dell is offering could be worth a look, also. Samsung's 55-inch model is fine for the price, and LG's got a 720p LED that should do the job if you want nothing to do with smart TV features. Some offerings (i.e. the console bundles) aren't on Dell's store yet, so but we've got the rest linked below.\nTVs\n","Title":"Dell's Black Friday deals include $99.99 24-inch monitor and $329.99 Xbox One | The Verge","Tags":["tech","black-friday"]}
