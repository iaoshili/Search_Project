Today, its Amazon Web Services are one of the dominant providers in the industry.

We strive to focus relentlessly on the customer, innovate rapidly, and drive operational excellence. We manage by two seemingly contradictory traits: impatience to deliver faster and a willingness to think long term.\"\nNet sales at Amazon increased 15% to $22.72 billion in the first quarter, compared with $19.74 billion in first quarter 2014. Operating income increased 74% to $255 million in the first quarter, compared with operating income of $146 million in first quarter 2014.  The company's net loss was $57 million in the first quarter, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared with net income of $108 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in first quarter 2014.
