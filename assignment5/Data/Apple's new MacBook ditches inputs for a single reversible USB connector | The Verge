{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple has just unveiled a new redesigned MacBook that's thinner, lighter, and smaller than existing MacBook Air models. While the 13-inch MacBook Air included an SD card reader, two full-size USB ports, and a Thunderbolt port, Apple is ditching all of these ports for its new 12-inch model. There\u2019s just a single USB Type-C connector, which is the smaller reversible connection that\u2019s starting to make its way to tablets and phones this year. You'll also get a headphone jack, but that's it.\nIt's hardly surprising that Apple is shifting to this new connector, as we  discovered in January that the company assigned 18 engineers to help build USB Type-C alongside companies like Lenovo, Dell, and HP. That engineer count is second only to Intel (with 24 people) and just above Microsoft\u2019s 16 assigned engineers. While competitors are primarily using the connector for tablets and phones, it's unusual to see Apple move to this single port on a new laptop.\nOne port to rule them all\nExisting USB accessories or USB keys won\u2019t plug straight into the new 12-inch MacBook Air, instead you\u2019ll need to use wireless connections to exchange files or an adapter. Apple's single MacBook connector supports power, DisplayPort, VGA, data, and HDMI. Apple focused on wireless connectivity using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth during its press event today, and the company will sell VGA and HDMI adapters separately, meaning only DisplayPort, charging, and USB 3.1 connectivity is supported natively through the single port.\nThe  additional HDMI and VGA adapters include a passthrough for USB Type-C charging, and a full-size USB port to connect older accessories, so you'll be able to use a monitor, charge, and connect a USB accessory.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with the newest MacBook\n","Title":"Apple's new MacBook ditches inputs for a single reversible USB connector | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","apple-watch-spring-event-2015\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7927306"]}
