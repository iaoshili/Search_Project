It's not exactly new, because it premiered internationally months ago, but it's finally coming to US theaters on March 27th. The period drama also stars Jennifer Lawrence, but even her Silver Linings Playbook chemistry with Cooper couldn't save Serena from being  a not-good movie .\nThe movie, set in Depression-era North Carolina, took more than 18 months to film and was completed in 2012. It has avoided US theaters until now, garnering lukewarm to  cold critical reception . Now, the movie is available to rent on iTunes, Amazon Instant Video, Xbox Video, Google Play, Vudu, and other VOD services weeks before its theater release, Engadget reports . This is likely an effort by the studio to squeeze profits from a movie no one really wanted to see anyway.\nLast year, Sony opted to release its  Kim Jong-un spoof The Interview online after it was pulled from theaters due to terror threats. Although the studio didn't recoup all of the money it spent on the movie, Sony ended up  making more than $30 million from online sales and rentals.\nOn iTunes, Serena rents for $10, and Google Play is renting it for $10 in SD and $11 in HD.\n","Title":"Bradley Cooper's new movie is available online weeks ahead of its theater release | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
