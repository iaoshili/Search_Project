I don't know, I've never been in that position. Every owner's manual I've ever had has ended up stuffed in a glovebox, pages greasy, creased, and torn.\nWith the McLaren F1, mishandling the owner's manual would be a crime \u2014 doubly so after you hear the amount of thought and effort that went into it. Mark Roberts, the man who hand-sketched the artwork for the manual leading up to the supercar's release over 20 years ago, describes the processÂ  in a video released by McLaren this week . \"We were actively encouraged to make it more and more special,\" he says.\nThe McLaren F1.\nThe books are rare, to say the least: only around a hundred F1s were made, spanning the better part of the 1990s. It was the fastest production car ever made at the time, topping out at 231 miles per hour; to celebrate that mark \u2014 still impressive even by today's supercar standards \u2014 Roberts illustrated all of the cars dials, displays, and instruments to read \"231.\"\nI don't even own a book this nice, much less the car to go with it.\n","Title":"This is the most beautiful owner's manual you've ever seen | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","transportation"]}
