{"Main text":"What is a smartwatch? Here's everything you need to know\nOn the eve of Apple's big announcement, let's recall the strange history of the wrist-worn device\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSometimes you hear a word so many times that you assume you know what it means. That's how I felt about the smartwatch. I vaguely remembered my father's Casio of the 1990s, and I had a general idea of what made a smartwatch smart. But after a conversation with The Verge's resident smartwatch expert, Dan Seifert, I realized there was plenty I hadn't known about the fashionable device.\nI recorded that conversation for The Verge's new podcast, What's Tech? Give the show 15 minutes, and I promise you'll sound like an expert when your parents ask, \"What the hell is this Apple Watch the news keeps talking about?\"\nWe post new episodes of What's Tech? every Tuesday.
