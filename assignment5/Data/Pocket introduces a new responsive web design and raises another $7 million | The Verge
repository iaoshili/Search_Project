{"Main text":"Pocket introduces a new responsive web design and raises another $7 million\nThe save-for-later service hints at coming changes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSave-for-later service  Pocket introduced a redesign of its web client today, making the site responsive for the first time and allowing it to scale more easily from smartphone screens to desktop monitors. The web version now includes a persistent sidebar offering one-tap access to your saved articles, videos, and images, as well as your favorites, archived saves, and anything you've tagged.\nThe company, which is building a kind of \" DVR for everything ,\" also announced $7 million in new investment from investors including New Enterprise Associates and Sound Ventures, the fund started by Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary. Pocket has raised $14.5 million in total. Founder Nate Weiner says the money will be used mostly for hiring; the company built and supports native apps for nearly all major platforms with just 15 employees. \"We've done a lot with that team but we really all want to move faster,\" Weiner says. He hints big changes are coming to the service later this year, but declines to say anything more.\nPocket says it now has 17 million registered users \u2014 it won't say how many are active \u2014 and they save 2 million items a day. If you spend significant time reading the web, it's essential (though some prefer its chief rival,  Instapaper ). With the newly responsive design, you can read it just about anywhere.\n","Title":"Pocket introduces a new responsive web design and raises another $7 million | The Verge","Tags":["apps","report","business","tech"]}
