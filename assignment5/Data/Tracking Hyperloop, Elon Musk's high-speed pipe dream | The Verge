And while Musk has been cagey about any intentions of actually building the system, the idea has already inspired widespread speculation: based on these plans, what would it take to actually build the Hyperloop?

During a live conference call following the  unveiling of his Hyperloop design , Musk seemingly decided on the spot that he would eventually follow through on the idea. \"I've been thinking about that, and I'm somewhat tempted to at least make a demonstration prototype,\" he said.\nA subscale proof of concept could be on the way\nUpdate\nElon Musk reveals plans for high-speed Hyperloop\nBy Russell Brandom on August  12, 2013 04:32 pm\nIn a blog post today , Elon Musk revealed plans for an alpha version of his much-anticipated Hyperloop, an innovative transportation system that would move passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in less than 30 minutes.  According to the plans (PDF) , the Hyperloop would transport passengers in aluminum pods traveling up to 800mph, mostly following the route of California's I-5. The estimated cost would be $6 billion for the passenger-only model, or $7.5 billion for a larger model capable...\nCritical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated.\nUpdate\nHere's how Elon Musk's Hyperloop might actually work\nBy Russell Brandom on July  18, 2013 10:30 am\nElon Musk has made his name on big ideas, whether it's space tourism or the electric car \u2014 but his latest project, mysteriously dubbed the Hyperloop, may be more revolutionary than anything he's done. It started with a simple promise: the ability to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco in half an hour. As time went on, Musk added more. It would be low-friction, and use such minimal power that the entire thing could be run on electricity from solar panels installed above the tracks.
