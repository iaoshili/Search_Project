{"Main text":"T-Mobile's 'Uncarrier 8.0' event is happening tomorrow\nThis is the T-Mobile's latest attempt to shake up the mobile industry\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nT-Mobile will try to force change upon the mobile world for the eighth time during Uncarrier 8.0 tomorrow morning at 7:30AM PT \/ 10:30AM ET. CEO John Legere will be back on stage for the latest edition of the quarterly event where Legere curses about the state of the wireless industry and how T-Mobile will be the company to fix it all. This time T-Mobile will stream the event live on Yahoo News, with Yahoo's David Pogue moderating the discussion.\nT-Mobile hasn't hinted as to what may be announced during the event, but did note that it would be one of its \"biggest and boldest moves yet.\" Previous Uncarrier events have brought about the end of two-year contracts, unlimited data use for select music streaming apps , andÂ  free international data roaming , but T-Mobile is still far behind market leaders AT&T and Verizon.\nIn a move that appears to be unrelated to tomorrow's event, T-Mobile has also improved its LTE speeds in the New York City area, as it continues to expand its Wideband LTE coverage \u2014 now available in 27 markets \u2014 which the company says can pull down 100Mbps. While we haven't seen those numbers, the speed increase over T-Mobile's standard LTE network is notable, reaching 62Mpbs in some areas.\nHoly crap tmo LTE pic.twitter.com\/My38bSiKQ4\n\u2014 T.C.
