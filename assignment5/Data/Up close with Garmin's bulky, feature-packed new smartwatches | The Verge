{"Main text":"Up close with Garmin's bulky, feature-packed new smartwatches\nBarometers, GPS, and more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLater this quarter, Garmin is launching three attempts to cement its place in the smartwatch market. The Fenix 3 takes Garmin's GPS features and adds a host of activity tracking options, updating it with color display options and an app platform called Connect IQ. The Epix is focused squarely on navigation. It updates your location continuously on a map; includes an altimeter, compass, and barometer; and supports phone notifications and existing apps. And the less rugged Vivoactive includes fitness tracking and app support in a thinner package. They'll run between $249.99, for a Vivoactive with no heart monitor, and $599.99, for a sapphire-domed Fenix 3 or an Epix with a built-in topographic map.\nWe haven't been able to try out most of these features, but the watches were on the show floor at CES, so we got a few pictures of  the chunky alternatives to Android Wear that people might be wearing later this year.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nGarmin Fenix 3\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
