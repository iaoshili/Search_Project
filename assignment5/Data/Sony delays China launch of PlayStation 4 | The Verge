{"Main text":"Sony delays China launch of PlayStation 4\nCompany reportedly facing prolonged negotiations with Chinese regulators\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony has delayed the launch of the PlayStation 4 in China for unspecified reasons. The company confirmed the move Thursday in a statement provided to  Reuters , citing only \"various factors.\" The console was supposed to launch for the first time in China on  January 11th , and Sony has not announced a new date.\nCiting a company source, Reuters reports that the delay is due to extended negotiations between Sony and Chinese authorities. China lifted a longtime ban on video game consoles from foreign manufacturers last year, and both Sony and rival Microsoft have looked to capitalize. Microsoft  launched its Xbox One console there in September, but also faced delays while awaiting government approval of its games. In addition to China's notoriously tough censorship rules, Sony and Microsoft will also have to compete against PC games, which became a popular alternative to console games during the 14-year ban.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
