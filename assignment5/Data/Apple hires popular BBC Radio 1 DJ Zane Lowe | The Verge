{"Main text":"Apple hires popular BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe\nThe popular DJ will host his final show on March 5th\nRadio 1 host Zane Lowe is leaving the BBC for Apple,  the BBC reports . The 41-year-old DJ has been with the station since 2003 and has garnered a massive following in the UK and around the world.\nLowe's final show will be on March 5th\nLowe is known for championing new and emerging music during his weekday evening radio slot. Alongside lesser-known artists like Sampha and FKA Twigs, Lowe pairs interviews and live sessions with the likes of Kanye West and Jay Z.\nIt's unclear exactly what position Lowe will hold at Apple, but it's a good indication that Apple is moving quickly to give its upcoming streaming service solid footing in the music world. The service,  reported to launch this summer , will likely  integrate technology from Beats Music into its own app. It's likely Lowe will play a role in shaping the service, either by curating music, hosting, or working with musicians for specialty shows.\nOf his BBC departure, Lowe said, \"The station has allowed me to share incredible music with the country\u2019s best music fans. I\u2019ve loved every minute of it. Exciting times lie ahead.\"\nLowe will host his last Radio 1 show on March 5th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
