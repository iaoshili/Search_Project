{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft was quick to support Google's Android Wear smartwatches last year, and it's ready to do the same for the Apple Watch. A new app update for Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service provides the first Apple Watch support through Microsoft's various iOS apps and services. OneDrive for Apple Watch will simply display photos on the smartwatch, allowing Apple Watch owners to view albums, delete photos, and find photos through tags all on the wrist. Viewing photos on a 1.5-inch or 1.7-inch display might not be the best experience, but it's still encouraging to see Microsoft quickly support rival platforms.\nThe software giant  supports Android Wear with OneNote , and an experimental keyboard that lets you  draw letters on a smartwatch . Microsoft has been consistently developing apps and services across iOS and Android as part of a new mobile and cloud focus across multiple platforms. The approach has resulted in Microsoft  apps on iOS and Android with better features than their Windows counterparts. Microsoft Office, one of the big examples, is currently far superior on rival platforms, but Microsoft is planning to update its Windows Phone version with big improvements for when Windows 10 is available this summer. A  preview of Microsoft Office on Windows 10 phones is set to debut by the end of the month.\n","Title":"Microsoft backs Apple Watch early with OneDrive update | The Verge","Tags":["apple","microsoft","tech"]}
