{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNetflix hasn\u2019t killed traditional TV yet but it\u2019s certainly giving Americans more to watch. New Nielsen viewing figures show that online video streaming is up 60 percent year-on-year, while traditional TV viewing fell by 4 percent in the same time period.\nAmericans watched nearly 11 hours of streaming video last month on average\nThis means that the average American watched nearly 11 hours of streaming video last month (up from seven hours a month a year ago) and more than 141 hours of live television (down from 147 hours a month). However, this pair of figures alone doesn't take into account the full spectrum of media consumption. Nielsen's report notes that video watching on smartphones increased by 14 percent over the same time period, but it doesn't include data about video watched via streaming sticks like the Chromecast or using apps on games consoles.\nTraditional TV watching dipped less for viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 (down 3 percent year-on-year) but the report confirms an emerging trend for consumers shunning pay TV subscriptions in favour of online alternatives. Some cable services are fighting back however, with HBO  launching an online-only service HBO Go in October this year rather than waiting for cable companies to build web streaming into their traditional packages.\n","Title":"TV viewing slips by 4 percent in the US as online streaming continues to rise | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
