{"Main text":"I don't care if you landed a spacecraft on a comet, your shirt is sexist and ostracizing\nThat's one small step for man, three steps back for humankind\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYesterday the European Space Agency  landed the Philae spacecraft on a comet , a powerful step forward for humanity and science alike. However, slightly before the big moment, coverage of the event reminded us how much progress remains to be accomplished back on Earth.\nA number of the scientists involved on this incredible project were  interviewed in the hours leading to contact by Nature Newsteam . One of those Rosetta scientists was Matt Taylor, who chose to dress, for this special occasion, in a bowling shirt covered in scantly clad caricatures of sexy women in provocative poses.\n\"This is going to be a very long day but a very exciting day,\" said Taylor. \"I think everyone should enjoy it because we're making history.\"\n\"I made a big mistake and I offended many people\"\nNo one knows why Taylor chose to wear that shirt on television during a massive scientific mission. From what we can tell, a woman who goes by the name of  Elly Prizeman on Twitter made the shirt for him, and is just as bewildered as he must be that anyone might be upset about her creation. Taylor apologized on Friday during a live ESA broadcast for wearing the shirt, stating that \"the shirt I wore this week... I made a big mistake and I offended many people, and I'm very sorry about this.\" Still, Taylor's personal apology doesn't make up for the fact that no one at ESA saw fit to stop him from representing the Space community with clothing that demeans 50 percent of the world's population. No one asked him to take it off, because presumably they didn't think about it. It wasn't worth worrying about.\nThis is the sort of casual misogyny that stops women from entering certain scientific fields. They see a guy like that on TV and they don't feel welcome. They see a poster of greased up women in a colleague's office and they know they aren't respected. They hear comments about \"bitches\" while out at a bar with fellow science students, and they decide to change majors. And those are the women who actually make it that far. Those are the few who persevered even when they were discouraged from pursuing degrees in physics, chemistry, and math throughout high school. These are the women who forged on despite the fact that they were told by elementary school classmates and the media at large that girls who like science are nerdy and unattractive. This is the climate women who dream of working at NASA or the ESA come up against, every single day. This shirt is representative of all of that, and the ESA has yet to issue a statement or apologize for that.\nNo no women are toooootally welcome in our community, just ask the dude in this shirt. https:\/\/t.co\/r88QRzsqAm pic.twitter.com\/XmhHKrNaq5\n\u2014 Rose Eveleth (@roseveleth) November 12, 2014\nThe Atlantic journalist Rose Eveleth brilliantly captures what that shirt represents in a community that continues to struggle, if not outright fail, to respect women.\nUpdate Nov 13, 2:00PM ET: The amazingly talented Arielle Duhaime-Ross added some powerful thoughts to this piece that I wish I'd included when it was originally published.\nUpdate Nov 14, 8:43AM ET: This post has been updated with a video of Matt Taylor's apology. The Verge has reached out to the ESA, but has yet to hear back.\n","Title":"I don't care if you landed a spacecraft on a comet, your shirt is sexist and ostracizing | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","science"]}
