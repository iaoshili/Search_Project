{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile most Star Wars fans are focused on the upcoming  J.J. Abrams film The Force Awakens , those with a soft spot for the prequel trilogy will finally get a chance to see the 3D version of Revenge of the Sith.  StarWars.com announced today that the delayed conversion will be screening at the Star Wars Celebration convention this April along with all of the other other Star Wars films in the series.\nBefore  Disney bought Lucasfilm , ratcheting up excitement with the promise of a new trilogy and a series of stand-alone films, a big part of the Star Wars focus was on 3D. All six films had been converted to 3D in preparation for theatrical release. The Phantom Menace 3D made it into theaters in 2012, with Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith scheduled to follow in 2013. The acquisition stopped all that, as  Disney cancelled the release plans in order to focus on the then-untitled Episode VII. The 3D Clones eventually surfaced at Star Wars Celebration Europe II in 2013, but Sith remained off the radar until now.\nGiven the rancor many fans feel towards the prequels, showing them at a convention like Celebration is a nice fit: the studio doesn't have to worry about harming the ever-deafening hype surrounding The Force Awakens, while still giving hardcore fans a look at something that nobody else has seen. Will the addition of 3D change Darth Vader's pitiful \"Nooooooo!\" at the end of Sith? We'll let you be the judge.\n","Title":"You'll be able to watch the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy in 3D, if you dare | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
