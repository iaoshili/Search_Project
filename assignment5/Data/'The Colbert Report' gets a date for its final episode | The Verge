On December 18th, one of the best political satires ever will conclude its nine year run.\nThe show, a spin-off of the long running comedy news program The Daily Show, features the character \"Stephen Colbert\" played by the comedian of the same name. Stephen Colbert, the character, is a pompous, boisterous, loudmouth inspired initially by the conservative talk show hosts on FOX News, though the character now parodies all types of political talking heads. Less is known about Stephen Colbert the person, who has taken the back seat to his character for nearly the past decade.\nWe'll have a chance to learn more about Colbert when heÂ  takes over hosting duties on The Late Show on CBS in 2015 . He has promised the host will be the real Colbert, not the Colbert he plays on television.

Or will he live, leaving room for his return at another place in another time?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
