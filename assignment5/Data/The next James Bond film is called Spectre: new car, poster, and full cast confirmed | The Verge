New members include Andrew Scott (who played Moriarty on BBC's Sherlock and will star as Denbigh here), Christoph Waltz (playing a character named Oberhauser \u2014 not, as previously rumored, classic villain Blofeld), Dave Bautista, Monica Bellucci, and Léa Seydoux.\nShooting locations for the new movie, which begins production tomorrow, include Pinewood London, Mexico City, Rome, Tangier & Erfoud, Morocco, Sölden, Obertilliach, and Lake Altaussee, Austria.\nThe 24th James Bond 007 film is called\u2026 #SPECTRE https:\/\/t.co\/g8CCxtk5ga\n\u2014 James Bond (@007) December 4, 2014\n2012's Skyfall, released 50 years after the first Bond movie, is the  most successful movie of the franchise with over $1.1 billion in worldwide gross receipts (which also makes it the ninth highest-grossing film of all time worldwide).\nSkyfall's director (Sam Mendes) and screenwriters (John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade) have all returned for the new film, as has Daniel Craig in the titular role. According to Mendes, in a  Charlie Rose interview from earlier this year, Bond 24 (as it was then called) won't be a direct sequel to Skyfall but will live in the same world \u2014 meaning we'll be seeing more of Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, and Ben Whishaw.\nAnd welcoming...

Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista had been strongly rumored (now confirmed) for the role of Hinx, a henchman that will no doubt laugh every time Bond tries to punch him, before succumbing to Bond's wily antics and use of environmental objects late in the film.\nSpectre will hit theaters November 6th, 2015.\nHere is the first teaser poster for #SPECTRE .
