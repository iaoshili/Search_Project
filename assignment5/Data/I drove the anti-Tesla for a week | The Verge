{"Main text":"339 Comments\nWeaning America off its gasoline addiction is hard. If it wasn\u2019t, we\u2019d have done it already. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that great electric cars are tough to make, which means the best ones are expensive. What\u2019s more, charging infrastructure is still in its infancy \u2014 you can\u2019t drive anywhere you want with complete certainty that you\u2019ll be able to put electrons back in the tank. Even when you can, recharging is a lot slower than pumping a few gallons of fossil fuel and going on your way.\nTesla believes in simply ripping the Band-Aid off \u2014 all of its models are pure electric, growing pains of immature technology and infrastructure be damned. GM, the very seat of the automotive establishment, is moving with every ounce of caution that Tesla has shrugged off.\nWith the launch of the Chevy Volt in 2010, GM hedged its bets with what it calls the \u201Cextended-range electric\u201D drivetrain, offering a limited range of pure electric operation supplemented by gasoline that offers unlimited travel as long as you can keep finding gas stations. For what you get, the Volt is reasonably expensive: it starts at over $34,000 for a car with less passenger space than the $17,520 Cruze.\nNow, imagine stuffing basically the same drivetrain into a Cadillac. That\u2019s the ELR . And it\u2019s $75,000. That\u2019s the cost of a Tesla Model S . Filled with 9 gallons of 91 octane, it\u2019s the anti-Tesla.\nActually, the ELR provided to me by GM clocked in just north of $82,000 for a car that is ostensibly a tarted-up Volt. That\u2019s some $12,000 more than a base Model S, which offers 208 miles of all-electric range compared to the ELR\u2019s 37. It\u2019s also over $40,000 more than the outgoing (but similar-looking) CTS coupe equipped with a traditional gasoline engine.\nHas GM lost its mind? I had a week and a 900-mile road trip from GM\u2019s hometown of Detroit to Oshkosh, Wisconsin and back to find out.\nIt\u2019s a sleek car. \"It looks fast standing still\" is a clich√© in automotive circles, but it applies particularly to the ELR, which looks like a wedge designed to obliterate headwind at all costs. It\u2019s one of the rare cases where the concept car \u2014 2009\u2019s Converj \u2014 is almost indistinguishable from the production model, a far cry from the Volt\u2019s sad translation from concept to family-hauler reality.\nA wedge designed to obliterate wind at all costs\nThe futurism continues on the interior, which generally looks great. It helps that GM delivered me a dark silver car over a rich, dark brown leather interior, which is a killer combination with just the right amount of contrast. Suede-like Alcantara blends with carbon fiber and wood along all the surfaces, mated to Cadillac\u2019s glossy Cue system in the center stack. The instrument cluster is just one big LCD display \u2014 a popular trend among automakers lately \u2014 broken up by a faux gauge bezel to visually differentiate data points. The driver can select from a small handful of \"skins\" for the cluster, all of which put a focus on communicating energy consumption in one way or another.\nI won\u2019t dwell on Cue because it\u2019s essentially the same as the system that Cadillac has been using for the past couple years, but it needs a lot of work. It\u2019s slow \u2014 I\u2019d even argue that it\u2019s dangerously slow. Operations that should be instantaneous (switching between radio and navigation controls, for instance) often took multiple seconds, distracting me and taking my eyes off the road for far longer than would be considered reasonable. Animations on the moving map \u2014 changing zoom level, showing upcoming turns, so on \u2014 never exceeded 6 or 8 fps, visibly stuttering the entire time. The processors used in cars aren\u2019t bound to the same power-sipping requirements that phones are, yet Google Maps on my Nexus 5 consistently ran circles around Cue. It doesn\u2019t make sense. GM needs to throw considerably more processing power at this system, but ultimately, it might simply come down to technologies like CarPlay and Android Auto taking over and putting these proprietary systems to shame.\nFortunately, driving this car is a lot less frustrating than interacting with it. Mashing the accelerator doesn\u2019t glue you to the back of your seat the way a proper sports car might, but it\u2019s not a slouch, either. Then again, most cars with electric drivetrains really benefit from the even torque distribution afforded by their motors: they feel like they\u2019re pulling you forward with gusto no matter your speed or situation. Engine RPM \u2014 which starts to lose meaning in hybrid and electric drivetrains \u2014 simply becomes a non-issue. The transition between electric and gasoline modes is seamless and so quiet that I barely ever noticed the engine was even running.\nYou could buy three Priuses instead\nBut the ELR, no matter how fast it looks, was never about speed or performance anyway: it\u2019s about feeling reasonably good about your stewardship of the planet\u2019s finite resources while looking good (and kind of rich) doing so. To that end, the bulk of the car\u2019s eco-friendliness ends after around 40 miles, at which point the electric power takes a back seat and the car acts more like a conventional hybrid \u2014 it can lean heavily on the battery in short bursts, but the engine is usually turned on. It\u2019s really no different from a Prius at that point. That\u2019s not a bad place to be as fuel economy goes; I consistently got close to 40 mpg on my journey. But for the price of this little coupe with room for a couple small humans in back and a couple moderately sized bags in the trunk, you could buy three Priuses. Three.\nOf course, you can save some money by running on electric. Charging is easy enough, it works just like any other electric car  \u2014 when you can find a charger. I was driving through rural parts of the Midwest where proper level 2 chargers are ghosts. Like the Volt, the ELR comes with a portable charger that works with standard 120-volt outlets, winds around itself for storage, and looks a little bit like an industrial power extension cord, but I ran into a number of outlets that it didn\u2019t like. To make sure charging goes smoothly (read: no fires), the portable charger is designed to be finicky, glowing an ominous red LED to let you know you\u2019re out of luck. Even if you can get it working, though, it can take 18 hours to top off the batteries.\nWith level 2 charging, a full charge comes in about four hours, which makes the ELR a great city car: urban areas are more likely to have chargers handy, and 37 miles is enough range to scoot around without sipping any gas. But the reality is that the ELR is designed like a grand tourer \u2014 a comfortable coupe with a cabin so quiet you can hear a pin drop. You don\u2019t want to drive a few blocks, you want to drive it across the country. There\u2019s something to be said for the unlimited range of a gasoline engine, but you can\u2019t shake the feeling that you\u2019re cheating, or that the electric mode is somehow make-believe. Certainly on my 900-mile trip, I spent the overwhelming majority of the time running on old-school internal combustion.\nStylish, comfortable, commanding, overpriced\nOnce you get over the realization that this isn\u2019t much of an electric car, the question becomes: what\u2019s the exact price that you ascribe to the raw fabulousness that the ELR affords? Because truly, this car is fabulous. No one is arguing that. I got wide-eyed looks everywhere I drove, and I never got tired of looking at it myself. It simply doesn\u2019t look like anything else on the road. It\u2019s stylish, it\u2019s comfortable, it\u2019s commanding. There are precious few production vehicles that look as though they were imported directly from the future; this is one of them.\nBut when you frame the ELR for what it really is \u2014 a compact hybrid coupe \u2014 Cadillac just doesn\u2019t have the brand cachet for this sticker price. I loved it, and I would drive a free one to the ends of the earth and back. I might even pay close to $50,000 for the pleasure, but certainly not $82,000.\nSo yes, GM is indeed out of its mind. Fortunately, with the ELR, it\u2019s out of its mind in the most entertaining and enjoyable way possible.\n","Title":"I drove the anti-Tesla for a week | The Verge","Tags":["report","transportation"]}
