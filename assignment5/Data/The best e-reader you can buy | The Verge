{"Main text":"The best e-reader you can buy\nRemember books? Time to get back into them\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHere\u2019s how I read on a tablet: I open the Kindle app. I read for somewhere between four and nine seconds. A notification pops up: I have a new email or someone tweeted a funny link at me. I tap on that notification, and check out whatever\u2019s come in. I check Twitter, and then maybe I\u2019ll just play a quick game of FIFA before I get to my subway stop. Wait, was I doing something?\nHere\u2019s how I read on an e-reader: I open it up, and I read. And I keep reading.\nSure, it\u2019s a device with exactly zero unique functionality, but an e-reader is perhaps a technologically inclined consumer\u2019s last plausible defense against the onslaught of notifications and distractions that every other device has become. It\u2019s the best way we have to get lost in the world of a book, to emulate the best of a printed volume \u2013 except with an e-reader, you get to have thousands of them with you at a time, and lots of added functionality. My phone and my tablet go everywhere with me, but I still look for my e-reader whenever I can.\nAcross the board, the best e-readers have batteries that last weeks and months, E Ink screens that are easy on the eyes, and front-lit displays that you can read in any situation; they have rugged, durable bodies that don\u2019t mind living for months inside your bag. They\u2019re cheap, too.\nThat\u2019s not to say they\u2019re all the same, though. The differences are just subtler, less obvious as you look at a spec list or a store shelf full of black squares with 6-inch screens. They ultimately come down to a single question: which world do you want to live in? Which books you buy, which apps you download, which company you trust to upgrade its products over time \u2014 you\u2019re implicitly deciding all that when you drop $100 or so for an e-reader.\nThe calculus can be complicated, and the answer isn\u2019t actually all that obvious. But if you\u2019re like most people, if you just want the best way to read the most books for the least money, there\u2019s only one way to go. Go Amazon.\nShot on location at WeWork . Also available on YouTube.\nThe Winner\nKindle Paperwhite (Wi-Fi)\nPicking the Kindle as the best e-reader is hardly a surprising or controversial decision. Though the competition is closer than I expected, particularly from Kobo, Amazon\u2019s advantage comes down to a single factor: books. Amazon has more books than Kobo (or any other store you\u2019ll find), and in nearly every case its prices are cheaper than its competitors. I checked bestseller lists, classics lists, and a poll of what people on Twitter were reading, and found exactly zero instances in which Kobo\u2019s e-book prices were cheaper than Amazon\u2019s. Amazon has the biggest selection and the best prices, period.\n(How Amazon achieved that status is another, significantly more emotional question. Amazon is forever at war with publishers, claiming to be exposing more books to more readers while publishers and authors say Amazon is stealing their livelihood. Here, make moral decisions as you will, but the objective fact is that Amazon achieved what it aimed : its library is huge, and it\u2019s cheap.)\nGiven that, all Amazon\u2019s e-readers have to be in order to be recommendable is good enough, and that\u2019s exactly what the Kindle Paperwhite is. It\u2019s a thin, small, 6-inch device with a sharp E Ink touchscreen that responds quickly as you swipe between pages or type in a search in the bookstore. Its battery lasts two months, and its light is even and never hurts my eyes even after hours of reading in the dark.\nReading on a Kindle, any Kindle, is a wonderfully minimal experience. You can pick among a few fonts and sizes (though I wish there were more options), tap to define any word, or drag your finger to highlight passages for later. My favorite feature is X-Ray: long-press on any name or location in a book, and it\u2019ll remind you who you\u2019re reading about. It\u2019s a godsend if you\u2019re like me, reading books in fits and starts over the course of many weeks. Voracious readers will also dive into Goodreads, the gigantic and amazingly engaged social network for readers that Amazon has integrated into its devices.\nThe Kindle Paperwhite has everything you need, and comes at an utterly affordable price. I\u2019d recommend getting the Special Offers \u2013 the ads really aren\u2019t very intrusive, and they save you a few bucks \u2014 and Wi-Fi. You don\u2019t need 3G, unless you want to download books every 15 minutes while you roam the countryside. The Paperwhite isn\u2019t the best-specced Kindle model (I\u2019ll get to the Voyage in a second), but it\u2019s the one you should buy.\nThe Runner Up\nKobo Aura H2O\nKobo\u2019s lineup of e-readers is astonishingly strong. It makes a half-dozen different devices, from the Kobo Mini to the Aura H2O. They\u2019re the Android to the Kindle\u2019s iOS; Kobo offers more features and far more customizability, but they come at the expense of content and simplicity.\nThe Aura H2O is a big, thick, waterproof e-reader, one of the most durable of any I\u2019ve ever used. It works in the tub, in a pool, even underwater. It\u2019s the one hardware feature Kindle can\u2019t match \u2014 if you want a waterproof device, get the H2O. It\u2019s not as nicely made as the Paperwhite, a little bigger and a lot bulkier, but it has a sharp 6.8-inch screen, long battery life, and everything else that really matters.\nThe best thing about Kobo, to me, is its Pocket integration. You can save pages and articles to Pocket, and they\u2019ll automatically appear on your Kobo; I plowed through my queue far faster on the Aura H2O than I ever would on my phone. It opens up a wealth of things to read, as does Kobo\u2019s far more open file support. You can buy books from Google, Sony, or any other store, and your Kobo will probably support them. You can also read PDFs, Word documents, and much more.\nIf you\u2019re willing to do the work, you can probably find any book you\u2019re looking for and read it on the Aura H2O. But Kobo\u2019s own store is missing some key books, and it\u2019s far more expensive than Amazon\u2019s; it also has a nasty tendency to show you study guides and commentary books before showing you the title you\u2019re almost certainly looking for. When it comes to just turning your device on, finding something to read, and getting down to it, Kobo lags far behind Kindle.\nWaterproof. Pocket integration. If those two things matter, buy a Kobo \u2014 and get the Aura, because it\u2019s the best one. But otherwise, the Kindle ecosystem is better in almost every relevant way.\nThe Others\n","Title":"The best e-reader you can buy | The Verge","Tags":["review","tech","this-is-my-next"]}
