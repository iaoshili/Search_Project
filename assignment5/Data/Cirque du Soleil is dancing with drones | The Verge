{"Main text":"Cirque du Soleil is dancing with drones\nThe performance company teamed up with ETH Zurich for a short film\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTake a real-life Fantasia, then set it about five years from right now, and you'd probably end up with Sparked, the short film you see here. A collaboration between famed entertainment troupe Cirque du Soleil and the university ETH Zurich, the plot is simple: an electrician short-circuits a fuse, bringing lamps in his workshop to life.\nBut that doesn't quite do it justice. The film was all shot live, without any special effects, while the drones constantly coordinated with a digital choreographer: a computer that tracked the quadcopters' positions 200 times a second. You can get a better sense of how they pulled it off from the behind-the-scenes video below.\nThis  isn't the first time we've seen a partnership between drones and dancers, so the next obvious question is: when will an all-drone troupe go on tour?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
