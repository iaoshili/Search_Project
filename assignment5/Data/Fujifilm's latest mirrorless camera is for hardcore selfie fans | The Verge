{"Main text":"Fujifilm's latest mirrorless camera is for hardcore selfie fans\nThe X-A2 has a 175-degree flip screen\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt'll be a bit more challenging than your phone to mount on a stick, but Fujifilm's new X-A2 could be the ultimate selfie camera nonetheless. Fujifilm has updated the  entry-level model to its well-regarded X-series of interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras with a 175-degree flip screen, letting you see what you're shooting when the lens is trained on your face.\nThe X-A2's improved autofocus performance comes in handy here, too; when the screen is flipped up, the camera automatically turns on face and eye detection to ensure the clearest portraits possible. And a tweaked version of Fujifilm's optically stabilized 16-50mm (24-76mm-equivalent) f\/3.5-5.6 lens \u2014 bundled with the X-A2 for $549.95 \u2014 just might offer a wide enough perspective to make you want to ditch the selfie stick.\nNext\nThe X-A2 will be available in brown, white, and black versions next month; a $699.95 double-zoom kit includes a 50-230mm (76-350mm-equivalent) f\/4.5-6.7 lens as well. It might be a tough sell for those who value the speed and convenience of phone cameras , but it'll certainly take better pictures.\nFujifilm is also updating its slimline premium compact camera. The XQ2 comes in new black \/ silver, white, and black finishes; features improved performance thanks to a new processor; and includes the Kodachrome-style \"Classic Chrome\" film simulation found on the  X30 and  X100T . It's out next month for $399.95.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
