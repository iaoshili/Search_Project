{"Main text":"What's next for cars at CES?\nConnected cars are still making news here, but automakers are looking ahead\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs exciting as CES has become in the auto industry, it\u2019s also become a little predictable. The same two topics \u2014 autonomous driving and the connected car \u2014 have been pervasive here for well over half a decade, and they\u2019re showing no signs of going anywhere. It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t still plenty of news to be made in those categories, but the news has become incremental. Cars are now expected to have touchscreens and internet connections. Pretty much every automaker has proven at one time or another that it can make a car drive on its own.\nIt raises the question, what\u2019s next? When every car has Android Auto and CarPlay compatibility, a configurable instrument cluster, and a self-driving mode, what will be the new hot automotive topic in the first week of every January?\n\"Consumers need to trust that that data is going to be handled in a responsible way.\"\nI posed the question to Don Butler, the ex-GM exec now responsible for Ford\u2019s connected car program. \"There\u2019s going to be a mass of data that becomes available once you\u2019ve got this computing power and once you\u2019ve got this connection,\" he says. \"Consumers need to trust that that data is going to be handled in a responsible way.\"\nIn fewer words, Butler is suggesting that automotive privacy and security is going to become a dominant conversation at this show in the coming years. Modern cars are rolling boxes of data, rife with computers and the connections to ferry information in and out. Of course, privacy has become a huge deal elsewhere in recent years \u2014 smartphones, massive hacks, PRISM \u2014 so connected cars can\u2019t be far behind.\nPrivacy is boring, though. Tremendously important, yes, but ultimately boring. The substance that sustains CES\u2019s life force is sizzle. What\u2019s the next sizzle for cars? CES 2015 gives us an early, tantalizing glimpse at two possibilities.\nTwo automakers here, BMW and Volkswagen, are demonstrating fully functional gesture-control systems . They sound gimmicky, but after seeing them in action, I\u2019m convinced that they\u2019re the real deal: they\u2019re less finicky than voice recognition, and unlike a touchscreen, they don\u2019t require that the driver divert a single moment of their attention. A wave of the hand requires a lower cognitive load than hunting for an \"end call\" button. And these systems aren\u2019t merely concepts \u2014 BMW has committed to rolling out gesture support in production cars within a year or two.\nI'm convinced that gesture control is the real deal\nNext, look for car sharing to become a dominant topic. Zipcar already does this well, but automakers want in: Ford made a long series of announcements about pilot programs that it\u2019s conducting around the world, including several specifically focused on car and ride sharing . It seems counterintuitive for car companies to take an interest in it \u2014 more sharing of cars would suggest fewer cars being sold, which is inherently bad for business. Butler disagrees. \"The way we look at it, we could either have the future thrust upon us, or we could go forward and boldly try to form the future in a way that makes sense, both for us as well as our customers, as well as the greater good of the world,\" he says. \"Those things are going to be coming, right? And we can kind of pretend to ignore it and just say, \u2018no no no, I\u2019m going to keep selling vehicles the way I do, and I just hope I can hold on.\u2019 No, we want to be a part of that solution going forward.\" A number of other automakers are engaged in car sharing programs around the world, including Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\nMake no mistake \u2014 this week, giant in-dash displays and self-driving cars are still as newsy as ever. But soon, they won\u2019t be, and car companies seem to know what they\u2019re going to be talking about next. CES is a car show now , after all.\nThe cars of CES 2015\nHow to get married with Android Auto\nAndrew Brenner, product manager for Android Auto at Google, sounds like he was basically born for the job: he got it, he says, because he'd hacked the dashboard of his own car with a Nexus 7. Now, he's picking me up in a Hyundai Sonata equipped with a near-production build of his software. We're going to get married.\nNvidia's plan for the car isn't as crazy as it sounds\nNvidia isn\u2019t selling LED-embroidered, heatpipe-cooled GPUs; it\u2019s pitching an all-encompassing vision of the future connected car. It doesn\u2019t seem to make sense \u2014 and in its full, blooming, overreaching glory, it really doesn\u2019t \u2014 but a more tempered, less ambitious version of the plan announced by Nvidia at CES actually makes perfectly good sense.\nWearing LG's webOS smartwatch made me happy\nThe watch has a circular app navigation menu, a slick and circular calendar app, and a quick settings menu that's also best viewed on a round screen. Audi's participation in this timepiece is limited to a branded watch face and an app that unlocks the car door via NFC.\nFord's latest experiments could make parking your car suck a lot less\nFord is trying something different , displaying some interesting incremental improvements for the present. It just announced a service that uses shared data from cars across the city to help others find open parking spots. That will partner well with two other experimental apps.\nFord is testing ways to help you not buy a car\nOn stage at his CES keynote, Ford CEO Mark Fields and product development VP Raj Nair announced that the company is testing ride-sharing systems in London, New York, Germany, and India \u2014 in other words, systems that would help you not buy a Ford.\nBMWs of the future will have Samsung tablets and gesture control\nBMW showed off a couple near-future technologies that'll be available on cars in the next few years. The first doesn't really sound futuristic at all \u2014 it's just a generic Samsung tablet, but the magic is in how tightly BMW's managed to integrate it with the car's systems. The \"Touch Command\" system includes the small Android tablet and a dock in the rear seat, allowing rear passengers to change climate settings, switch radio stations, adjust their seats, and more \u2014 in other words, it's basically a portable iDrive controller for when you're getting chauffeured around.\nThe Mercedes-Benz F 015: this is what tomorrow's self-driving cars look like\nThe F 015 Luxury in Motion \u2014 yes, \"Luxury in Motion\" is part of the car's name \u2014 is basically a sleek pod with a huge passenger compartment, a fortuitous side effect of an imagined future where we spend most of our times chilling out in cars while they drive us around all by themselves. Mercedes actually calls the cabin \"lounge-like,\" thanks to four rotating seats that can face each other.\nVolkswagen's Golf R Touch is a next-generation pocket rocket\nHigh-performance hatches like the GTI and Golf R are a big part of Volkswagen's bread and butter, but they've never really been known as bastions of high technology. That might be changing today with the introduction of the Golf R Touch at CES, a concept that pushes the dashboard to the bleeding edge.\nI tried to crash a BMW, but it parked itself instead\nFirst, I got a glimpse of a collision avoidance system using an array of fairly well-concealed external sensors on one of the i3s. BMW set up a bunch of big, soft blocks dressed to look like walls and other hazards \u2014 it was a little Super Mario-esque, come to think of it \u2014 and told me to punch the gas in their direction. That's a tough command to process, and it took me a second to work up the courage.\nNvidia's Tegra X1 infotainment system is actually rather awesome\nNvidia's demo infotainment system has five main areas: one each for music and in-car controls, one for smartphone integration via things like Android Auto, one for viewing feeds from cameras around the car, and a final one for navigation. Nothing's incredibly fancy about this interface, but the 3D navigation is presented in a really cool, ghostly look, and is navigable via the typical touchscreen gestures.\nThis is the 2016 Chevrolet Volt\nThe redesigned Volt is a huge deal for General Motors: it's the first rethinking of the company's \"extended-range electric\" drivetrain since the debut of the original Volt in concept form in 2007. (Former GM CEO Rick Wagoner himself rolled onto stage in a Volt at a CES keynote in 2008.)\nParrot's new dashboard wants to turn your old clunker into a smartcar\nThis unit is meant to upgrade a dumb car into a smart one, a fresh take on the AsteroidParrot has been selling for years. The company says the new system is compatible with 90 percent of the cars on the road today, anything that can fit a double DIN sized CD player.\nThis year, your car will start yelling at you for driving poorly\nGeneral Motors' OnStar division is announcing that it's launching a \"driver assessment\" program in cars that will track how well drivers drive \u2014 hard braking, hard acceleration, and so on \u2014 and offer detailed feedback after collecting 90 days' worth of data. Afterward, they'll have the option of forwarding the data on to Progressive as part of its Snapshot insurance discount program, where you can get discounted insurance rates for driving well.\nHyundai will let you start your car with an Android Wear watch\nThe app gives drivers the ability to access remote vehicle operations right from their wrists, such as starting and stopping the engine, locking and unlocking the doors, and activating safety features like flashing the headlights or honking the horn. Users will be able to locate their car or call roadside assistance from the app as well.\nLearn more\n","Title":"What's next for cars at CES? | The Verge","Tags":["tech","transportation","ces-2015"]}
