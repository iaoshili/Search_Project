{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn teasing the Galaxy S6 ahead of its unveiling next month, Samsung has continued to  show a mysterious symbol that looks like a bolt of lightning. Samsung usually references speed and productivity in conjunction with this symbol, but it hasn't said exactly what the lightning bolt refers to. The answer could be pretty simple: a new Samsung processor that's likely inside the S6.\nMore speed, less battery drain\nSamsung  announced this week that it's going to mass-produce new Exynos 7 Octa chips with a 14nm process. What that means, in layman's terms, is that a device using it may receive \"up to 20 percent faster speed, 35 percent less power consumption, and 30 percent productivity gain\" over what's currently in use (20nm), according to Samsung. If accurate, that would represent a nice addition to the S6, resulting in longer battery life and better all around performance.\nThe new chips have a nice big \"7\" on them, which, when stacked edge to edge, certainly look a lot like that logo Samsung has been showing. Though Samsung hasn't announced that it'll be using this chip, its use is all-but confirmed: we know that Samsung  won't be using one of Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors in the new phone, and the Exynos 7 Octa is the obvious choice for a replacement. We'll learn more when the phone is  unveiled on March 1st at an event in Barcelona.\nI can give more time to others.
