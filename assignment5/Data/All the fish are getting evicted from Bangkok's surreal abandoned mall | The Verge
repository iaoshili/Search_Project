The four-story, roof-less structure has been home to various mango fish and catfish since at least 2004,  according to Bangkok Post . The pictures, if you've never seen,  are completely surreal .\nNew vacancies\nWorkers from the Fisheries Department and related researches are using fishing nets to grab the fish and will hold them at various centers before being released to reservoirs, canals, and rivers, according to the Samut Prakan center director Veera Watcharagoneyotine.\nAfter the fish have all been vacated, the vacant complex-turned-pond will be drained. As for what comes next, that isn't clear. According to a city official, the building's owner will have to pay for repairs (including a roof), while the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is asking for 10 million baht (about $306,223.70 in US dollars) for demolition costs.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
