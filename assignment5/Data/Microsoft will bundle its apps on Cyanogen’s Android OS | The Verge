{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRumors of a  Microsoft and Cyanogen partnership have been making the rounds recently, and the Android mod maker is confirming them today. In an email to The Verge, Cyanogen says it's partnering with Microsoft to integrate the software giant\u2019s consumer apps and services into the Cyanogen OS. Bing, Skype, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, and Microsoft Office will all be bundled later this year. As part of the partnership, Microsoft has committed to creating \"native integrations\" on Cyanogen OS.\nThese native integrations will likely result in increased integration for Microsoft\u2019s apps and services in a way the company has been trialling recently with Android. Microsoft has experimented with a number of Android apps, and even a  Next Lock Screen that aims to replace the traditional lock screen of Google\u2019s Android OS. These experiments, and Microsoft's many Android apps, are all aimed at pulling consumers away from Google services on Android.\nA partnership aimed at Google's version of Android\n\"People around the world use Cyanogen's operating system and popular Microsoft services to engage with what matters most to them on their mobile devices,\" said Kirt McMaster, CEO of Cyanogen Inc. \"This exciting partnership with Microsoft will enable us to bring new kinds of integrated services to mobile users in markets around the world.\" Microsoft says it will \"continue to deliver world-class experiences across productivity and communications on Windows, and we're delighted that Cyanogen users will soon be able to take advantage of those same powerful services.\"\nMicrosoft's partnership with Cyanogen follows a number of similar moves with Android smartphone and tablet makers.  Samsung is bundling some Microsoft apps and services with its new Galaxy S6, following a bitter Android royalties dispute.  Dell is also planning to bundle Office and other Microsoft apps on its Android devices.\n","Title":"Microsoft will bundle its apps on Cyanogen\u2019s Android OS | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","google","mobile","tech"]}
