{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNeil Gaiman's Hugo Award-winning novel American Gods is finally getting adapted for the small screen.  Starz today announced that it's currently developing a series based on the book, and Pushing Daisies creator Bryan Fuller is on deck to write the pilot.\nWhen you create something like 'American Gods,' you don't want to let the fans down.\nIn a prepared statement, Gaiman gave the sense that he feels his story is in good hands. \"When you create something like 'American Gods'...you don't want to let the fans down, or the people who care and have been casting it online since the dawn of recorded history,\" he says. \"What I love most about the team who I trust to take it out to the world, is that they are the same kind of fanatics that American Gods has attracted since the start.\" American Gods was originally released in 2001 to critical acclaim, as it follows godly entities struggling to make it in an America tinged with Gaiman's signature darkness.\nBryan Fuller's presence is a welcome addition to the series. Fuller is already no stranger to the playfully macabre, given his role in developing NBC's Hannibal. The writer also created such series as Dead Like Me and WonderFalls, and worked on Heroes. Fellow Heroes alum Michael Green will serve as series showrunner.\nWhile there's still no guarantee the show will make its debut on TV screens, it's good news for a series that has been in development for years. The novel was originally being developed for HBO as far back as 2011, but the show was dropped earlier this year because the network  \"just couldn't get it right.\"\n","Title":"Starz developing series based on Neil Gaiman's 'American Gods' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
