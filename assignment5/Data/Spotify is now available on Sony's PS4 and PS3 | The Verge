{"Main text":"Spotify is now available on Sony's PS4 and PS3\nSony and Spotify are new BFFs\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA few months ago, Sony brought good news to its music-loving PlayStation users \u2014 the company was officially discontinuing its failed Music Unlimited streaming service and was instead  partnering with the biggest player in the streaming music space, Spotify . As of today, that changeover is officially complete: Music Unlimited is dead, and Spotify users can now log into the service on either the PS3 or PS4. It\u2019s an exclusive deal, as well \u2014 Spotify won\u2019t be coming to the Xbox One any time soon. Ahead of its launch, we had a chance to get a demo of Spotify running on the PS4 and learn a lot more about how Sony\u2019s new music service of choice works on its consoles.\nThe first time you launch the Spotify app on your PlayStation console, you\u2019re met with the expected sign up or log in screen. Existing Spotify users can enter their credentials or log in with Facebook, or they can use the Spotify Connect feature from a smartphone or tablet. The latter is a pretty slick way to get set up \u2014 assuming your PS console and phone are on the same wireless network, you\u2019ll see an option to connect to the console right in the app. Once you connect, all your credentials will be set up on the console and you can start playing music there. If you\u2019re not a Spotify customer, you can sign up for a premium membership and bill it straight through your PlayStation Network account, but having premium isn\u2019t a requirement.\nThe interface should be familiar to PlayStation and Spotify users alike\nOnce you\u2019re logged in, you\u2019re presented with an interface that\u2019s equal part familiar to PlayStation and Spotify users alike. By default, you\u2019re dropped into Spotify\u2019s main \"browse\" section, which lets you find curated playlists that the service is highlighting on a particular day (like \"TGIF\" or \"commuter flow\"), as well as the extensive genre- and mood-based playlist sub-categories. The iconography is purely Spotify and will be immediately familiar to anyone who has used the service a bit, but the app design more closely mirrors Sony\u2019s PS4 interface. It\u2019s pretty simple and straightforward; it doesn\u2019t take many steps to get straight into playing music. And any song you come across can be added to your collection with one click of a button.\nUnfortunately, the other main section of Spotify\u2019s app for PlayStation is pretty cut-back compared to what\u2019s available in the company\u2019s other apps. In the \"your music\" feed, you\u2019ll see every playlist in your account as well as a long scroll of every single song you\u2019ve added to your collection. But there\u2019s no way to browse through your favorite artists or albums that you\u2019ve saved to your collection. That\u2019s less ideal if you\u2019re more focused on specific albums rather than playlists, but Spotify was quick to point out that every single song and album on the service is available \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to use the search feature to find them.\nAll of Spotify's vast catalog is available, you'll just need search to access it all\nIf you have specific albums or songs in mind, there\u2019s another option for finding them beyond search. The Spotify Connect feature means that you can just use your phone or tablet to control playback or quickly browse your music in a way that might be more immediately familiar. That\u2019s not to say that the PlayStation app is confusing \u2014 playlists are easily and quickly accessible \u2014 it\u2019s just harder to get straight to a specific album. Fortunately, Spotify says it\u2019s going to keep on improving the app and adding new features over time.\nThe PS4 in particular has one useful feature that makes perfect sense for a gaming console \u2014 you can play music in the background as you play games. It\u2019s quite simple \u2014 just start up your music, head back to the main PS4 interface, and start up your game. Once you\u2019re up and running you can hold down the PS button to pull up the console\u2019s menu and pause or adjust the volume of your tunes. The one big catch is that games aren\u2019t smart enough to realize that you\u2019re playing music from another app, so the Spotify music mixes in with in-game music. You\u2019ll need to dive into the game\u2019s menu screen to turn down the in-game music and sound effects to get everything squared away.\nIt would be great if the system could recognize that you\u2019re playing audio from another source and adjust accordingly, but most games have pretty flexible music controls that should let you get things balanced properly without too much trouble. PS3 owners are out of luck on this front, however \u2014 you can only do this with the PS4. It\u2019s also worth noting that PS Vita users are entirely out of luck here, as well. Music Unlimited worked on Sony\u2019s portable device, but right now there aren't any plans to bring Spotify to the Vita.\nOverall, Spotify for the PlayStation works just as you\u2019d hope \u2014 while it doesn\u2019t have every navigation feature found in the main apps, you can still get at all your playlists and every song in the service\u2019s vast catalog. And there\u2019s no question it\u2019ll be a better option that Music Unlimited was \u2014 60 million people have Spotify accounts and they\u2019ll be able to use them on the PlayStation as of today, even if they aren\u2019t paying for them. That\u2019s a lot more than were ever using Music Unlimited. Between this and the  newly launched PlayStation Vue streaming TV service , Sony is definitely making a move to bolster the PS4\u2019s media capabilities. The company found a lot of success by playing up the system\u2019s pure gaming prowess, but it\u2019s slowly becoming an entertainment center that can match up with the Xbox One, as well.\n","Title":"Spotify is now available on Sony's PS4 and PS3 | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","entertainment","tech"]}
