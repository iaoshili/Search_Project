{"Main text":"NASA's Opportunity rover just completed an 11-year marathon on Mars\nIt's a slow time, but still a record for Mars\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNever forget that we've got more than one robot on Mars. While Curiosity has been busy finding signs of  an ancient nitrogen cycle on the Red Planet, Opportunity \u2014 which touched down in January 2004 \u2014 has just completed the first ever extraterrestrial marathon. NASA  confirmed this week that the six-wheeled robot has now traveled more than 26.219 miles in 11 years and two months. \"This is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world,\" said Opportunity's  project manager John Callas . \"A first time happens only once.\"\nOpportunity has already wildly exceeded expectations. The rover was originally scheduled to operate for only 90 Martian days (a Martian day or sol is around 40 minutes longer than an Earth day). And apart from exceeding its run-time by more than 10 years, it's also made  numerous scientific discoveries , including examining the first meteorite found on another planet and finding evidence that water once flowed across Mars.\nA map showing the Opportunity rover's entire journey.

Its twin rover, Spirit, stopped moving in 2010 and became (rather euphemistically) a \"static research station.\" And Opportunity is suffering from the gradual decay that affects all computer systems. Its flash memory has worn out out after numerous writes and re-writes, and as a consequence the rover is suffering from  bouts of amnesia .\n\"[Opportunity] has been amazingly healthy considering how much we\u2019ve used it \u2014 we thought the mobility system would have worn out a long ago but it\u2019s in great health,\" said Callas in December last year . \"But anything could fail at any moment... It\u2019s like you have an aging parent, that is otherwise in good health \u2014 maybe they go for a little jog every day, play tennis each day \u2014 but you never know, they could have a massive stroke right in the middle of the night. So we\u2019re always cautious that something could happen.\"\nVerge Video: Can we colonize Mars?\n","Title":"NASA's Opportunity rover just completed an 11-year marathon on Mars | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
