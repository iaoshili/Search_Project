{"Main text":"Aaron Sorkin says Steve Jobs' daughter Lisa is the hero of his film\nReal-life Lisa didn't participate in Isaacson's bio but spoke with Sorkin about the script\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe still don't know who is going to play the titular character in Aaron Sorkin \/ Danny Boyle's upcoming Steve Jobs film \u2014  Christian Bale recently dropped out , and the currently-rumored frontrunner is Michael Fassbender. In an  interview with The Independent , Sorkin says a casting announcement is imminent, but more interestingly, Sorkin also provides a new take on the focus on his Jobs film (which, he stresses, is not a \"biopic\"), including a larger role for Jobs' daughter, Lisa:\n\"With The Social Network, I was interested in the psychology of the world's most successful social networking system being invented by the world's most anti-social guy. And in the case of Steve Jobs, it's the relationships he had \u2014 particularly with his daughter, Lisa \u2014 that drew me to it,\" he says. Jobs initially denied paternity of his daughter, now 36, though they later reconnected and she lived with him in her teens. \"She didn't participate in Walter Isaacson's book, because her father was alive at the time, and she didn't want to alienate either of her parents, so I was very grateful that she was willing to spend time with me,\" says Sorkin. \"She is the heroine of the movie.\"\nThe 181-page script is still reportedly a three-act story \"set backstage before three of Jobs' major product launches spanning 16 years\" (it's a little more than 16 years, but our guess would be 1983's Macintosh debut, 1988's NeXT Introduction, and 2001's iPod reveal,  which Sorkin himself revealed in 2012 ).\nIf that's still the case, how Lisa will be incorporated \u2014 how she will find herself backstage \u2014 will be interesting, to say the least. In the same interview, Sorkin addresses Facebook founder  Mark Zuckerberg's thoughts on his portrayal in The Social Network : \"People don't live their lives in the same narrative structure as a movie; our lives don't play out in a series of scenes; people don't speak in dialogue \u2014 so that was made up.\"\nAccording to THR , the role of Jobs' daughter is still being cast, with actresses reading lines from The Newsroom's second season in order to keep the biopic script a secret. The studio has reportedly courted Jessica Chastain for an unspecified role .\n","Title":"Aaron Sorkin says Steve Jobs' daughter Lisa is the hero of his film | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
