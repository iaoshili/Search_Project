{"Main text":"How a Chinese smartwatch became the surprise hit of Mobile World Congress\nHuawei hopes to shake up the wearable world with its new Watch\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDid you hear the one about the Chinese telecom giant that tried to turn into a hip watchmaker?\nThat\u2019s been one of the more surprising stories to come out of this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress. Huawei, a colossal company that makes most of its money on networking equipment and infrastructure, has launched its most overt play for consumers yet by unveiling its first smartwatch. The Huawei Watch is a circular device that looks closer to a traditional watch than the Moto 360, LG G Watch R, or any other Android Wear product to date. One week before Apple is set to reveal the final details of its own watch, Huawei has presented a very different vision informed by the principles of classical watch design.\nThe shift is notable for an enterprise-focused company with a name that most Westerners can barely pronounce. Although Huawei has spent the past few years attempting to build up its consumer presence, it hasn\u2019t succeeded in penetrating key markets like the US. But that could change later this year, and the watch should play a key role in terms of getting people to take notice of the company.\n\u201CWe\u2019re trying to make Huawei a more fashionable brand,\u201D says Richard Yu (pictured), CEO of Huawei\u2019s consumer division. \u201CWe\u2019re trying to change our image.\u201D Yu says Huawei\u2019s cachet is already ahead of Chinese competitors like Xiaomi, which he describes as an \u201Cultra low-end\u201D brand \u201Cfor low-end people.\u201D Despite Yu\u2019s bluster, the odds are still stacked against Huawei, especially in the US. But the company is serious about this struggle.\nDevelopment of the Huawei Watch was led by Ben Norton, a watch designer that previously worked for Fossil in the US and in Switzerland on brands like Emporio Armani. \"I had this opportunity to start designing smartwatches, and had a vision shared by many of my colleagues to have a smartwatch that was very much like a traditional watch,\" Norton says. \"We just believe that the consumer wants an actual watch that feels like a watch.\"\nYu says Samsung's watches are \"ugly\" and Apple's is \"okay\"\nHuawei is fully behind Norton\u2019s vision. \"Samsung already launched its watch, but the design was ugly and no one wanted to buy it,\" says Yu, who believes that the Huawei Watch\u2019s focus on classicism and authenticity will set it apart. He says the Apple Watch design is \"good, it\u2019s okay, but I think their smartwatch design is not a traditional, classical one. Our design is differentiated from them. Many people love this style; people have a loyalty to the tradition.\"\nI\u2019m unconvinced by Huawei\u2019s assumption that people want watches to remain a certain way forever. Watches are technology with a singular purpose; they are also jewelry. When I conducted my interviews with Yu and Norton, I was wearing a square Braun digital watch that does its job of telling time, being comfortable, and looking the way I want it to look. It\u2019s free from the physical constrictions that watchmakers dealt with throughout the century before it was designed, which allows it to exist in the form I want it to. Resorting to conventional forms in the early days of smartwatches is understandable to help familiarize people with the concept, but in the long term I think such designs will prove to be overwrought visual metaphors rendered in steel.\nSo take this for what it\u2019s worth: the Huawei Watch might not feel like a luxury watch, but it sure does feel like a watch. Describing it as \"very minimalist and very clean\" and \"a watch that you could wear with a tuxedo or a t-shirt,\" Norton says that it\u2019s aimed at \"your typical consumer that would also wear CK or Armani or many other of those brands at the mid-level.\" That feels like the right approach for smartwatches at this stage. These are devices that will by necessity cost a few hundred dollars, but watches like the Moto 360 and Pebble Steel haven\u2019t matched the level of quality you\u2019d expect from a timepiece at that price point. While the Huawei Watch didn\u2019t blow me away with its craftsmanship, it isn\u2019t something I\u2019d be embarrassed to wear. The stainless steel build and sapphire crystal face go a long way to making it feel like an actual timepiece.\n\"If it\u2019s too cheap, no one will want to use it,\" says Yu, noting that the entry-level Apple Watch is made of aluminum. Pricing is yet to be announced, but both Yu and Norton indicate that it will be reasonable; the watch won\u2019t be out until June, and Yu says he\u2019ll be observing Apple\u2019s sales with interest. The CEO also says the company would like to have a presence in traditional watch stores and is considering a model where the watch could be made of more expensive materials, like 18- or 24-karat gold, but feature upgradable components to avoid technical obsolescence.\nAnother important element is the watch\u2019s size, which Norton says was a very specific and deliberate choice to broaden the potential consumer base. He settled on 42mm, which he calls \"a typical size for a traditional watch\" by brands from CK to Omega, but also notes that many women wear watches in the \"boyfriend\" size of around 38 to 42mm. Although a little on the thick side, it\u2019s a much more universal and comfortable design than something like the Moto 360, which is around 46mm and \u2014 to my taste, at least \u2014 feels like strapping a CD to your wrist. The thin top ring on the Huawei Watch helps, too, allowing the display to dominate the watch\u2019s small footprint.\n\"The case, although important, is essentially the frame around the dial.\"\nNorton also believes that the virtual watch faces, of which Huawei is providing over 40, will be a major selling point for the device. \"As a traditional watch designer, I very much had the mentality that the case, although important, is essentially the frame around the dial \u2014 the painting, so to speak,\" he says. \"Because of the quality of our display, we\u2019re able to show the details of each dial very strongly. And because it\u2019s electronic we have a lot of openness in functionality of how far we can go with the dials.\" I was surprised by Norton\u2019s enthusiasm here; the Huawei Watch\u2019s screen is good, even great, but it\u2019s still just a screen. I didn\u2019t expect a traditional watch designer to view it as a viable substitute for the most important element of their previous work.\nEven if people take to the design, the hardest part may be convincing them to wear a smartwatch in the first place. The Huawei Watch runs Android Wear, an OS that has reportedly shipped on just over 720,000 devices to date . The advent of the Apple Watch could well drive awareness of the category as a whole, just as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad did, but for now it\u2019s far from clear that consumers want to buy into Google\u2019s vision. And even compared to competing Android Wear OEMs like Samsung and Motorola, Huawei has its work cut out when it comes to raising brand awareness.\nThe most publicity Huawei has received in the US has been when various government officials have described the Chinese company\u2019s equipment as a threat to national security , even though a probe reportedly found no evidence and a leak from Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA was, in fact, spying on Huawei in the other direction. Whether the allegations are true is almost beside the point \u2014 it\u2019s difficult enough for Chinese companies to build a brand in the US even without innuendo surrounding them. But Huawei plans to plunge into the American smartphone market later this year and is leaning on Google to do so.\nIn the US, Huawei\u2019s phones will come with stock Android free from the custom software it loads on its Chinese devices \u2014 a move designed to assuage fears about the company\u2019s intentions. \"In the US we have to do some compromise to avoid any concern,\" says Yu. \"No excuse! If you have a problem you can check with Google. [American customers] trust Google so they can trust Huawei.\"\nThe Huawei Watch has turned heads, if nothing else, which could have a knock-on effect for the company\u2019s phones. But even if Huawei\u2019s efforts come to nothing, it\u2019s notable that a company best known for routers and cell towers is even attempting to join the conversation around fashion and high-touch industrial design. Huawei would be one of the least likely US brand successes of all time, but as its Mobile World Congress presence shows, wearable technology is new enough to be anyone\u2019s game.\n","Title":"How a Chinese smartwatch became the surprise hit of Mobile World Congress | The Verge","Tags":["report","tech","mwc-2015"]}
