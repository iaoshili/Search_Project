{"Main text":"Alleged Bitcoin 'creator' is crowdfunding his lawsuit against Newsweek using Bitcoin\nDorian Nakamoto is suing Newsweek for lying\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNewsweek may soon be sued for  alleging Dorian Nakamoto is the creator of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Money is being raised through the Dorian Nakamoto Legal Defense Fund in order to file a lawsuit against Newsweek, which has not retracted its initial article about the 65-year-old man. The fund is taking contributions through credit or debit card, as well as Bitcoin.\nNewsweek Lied\nOn top of providing an avenue for public donation, the website 'Newsweek Lied' lists the publication's transgressions, which reportedly include misstatements of fact, altered or fabricated quotes, and even an entirely falsified conversation. It also cites criticism against the article which was  published earlier this year, and how Newsweek contributor Leah McGrath Goodman supposedly obtained Nakamoto's private information through unethical means. Because his personal information was exposed through Goodman's piece, the Californian resident has been dogged with unwanted attention, and was reportedly  involved in a car chase when he attempted to evade reporters.\nNo target funding goal has been disclosed as of yet, but any surplus will then be given to Nakamoto to assist with expenses.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
