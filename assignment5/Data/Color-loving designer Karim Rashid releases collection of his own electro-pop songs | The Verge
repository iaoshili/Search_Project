{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKarim Rashid, industrial designer and apparent evangelist for the color pink, has released an electro-pop EP on iTunes . Titled Change The World, its eight tracks \u2014 three original songs and five radio edits, remixes, and instrumental versions \u2014 feature the production and vocal talents of the man Time called \" the poet of plastic .\"\nThe EP's title comes from a call to arms in Rashid's own \" Karimanifesto \": \"If human nature is to live in the past \u2014 to change the world is to change human nature.\" In his manifesto, Rashid, the same designer that envisioned a hotel with a dominant pink and lime green color scheme , calls for people to \"release themselves\" from kitsch.\nThe EP's title comes from Rashid's own \"Karimanifesto\"\nThird track Love Kolor \u2014 something of a statement of fact for Karim \u2014 doesn't quite make good on that directive, the production taking cues from the Pet Shop Boys and featuring lines such as \"rage against beige\" sung in lilting auto-tune. The other two full tracks, Nutopia and Change the World, are more wistful, explaining the award-winning designer's process, desires, and \"yearning\" for a new world in a processed robot voice. Samples of all of Rashid's EP tracks are available now on iTunes, released through the designer's own label, KariMusik.\n","Title":"Color-loving designer Karim Rashid releases collection of his own electro-pop songs | The Verge","Tags":["culture","design","entertainment"]}
