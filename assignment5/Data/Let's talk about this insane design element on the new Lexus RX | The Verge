{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt the New York auto show this morning, LexusÂ  rolled out its 2016 RX , a bread-and-butter mid-sized crossover for the company that isn't particularly interesting to the auto enthusiasts in the crowd.\nBut this is a modern Lexus, which means the design language has to be completely bonkers. In this regard, the RX delivers.\nIn place of normal C- and D-pillars \u2014 the elements that connect the roof to the body toward the back of a car \u2014 there's a swoopy mix of metal, chrome, and glass. At a glance, the glass appears to flow uninterrupted from the side to the rear window, framed by a dagger-shaped thing dangling from the roofline. I haven't had a chance to form an opinion on it yet, but it definitely catches the eye.\nIt's an optical illusion\nIt's a bit of a magic trick, though: if you open the rear lid, you immediately notice that the pillars are still there \u2014 Lexus has just designed the glass to flow around them on the outside. The uninterrupted view around the back from inside the car is strictly an optical illusion, almost certainly for structural and safety reasons.\nAs a 2016 model, the RX will be available later this year, so you've got some time to decide whether you want to let this level of design insanity into your heart.\nVerge Video: The cars of the Detroit Auto Show in 3 minutes\n","Title":"Let's talk about this insane design element on the new Lexus RX | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
