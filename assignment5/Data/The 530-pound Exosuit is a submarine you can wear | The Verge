{"Main text":"The 530-pound Exosuit is a submarine you can wear\nScientists are now using the suit to study glowing fish 1,000 feet below the surface\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe six-and-a-half foot tall, 530-pound aluminum suit looks like something out of an action movie. In reality it has an entirely different \u2014 and more intriguing \u2014 purpose. Come this summer, scientists will be using the suit, known as the Exosuit, to dive up to 1,000 feet into the ocean with the aim of collecting and studying bioluminescent fish. At such extreme depths, despite almost no visible light, a bounty of mysterious, glowing fish thrive. And with the Exosuit, scientists will observe these fish like never before.\nThe Exosuit itself is the latest \"atmospheric diving system\" \u2014 a term for suits that protect the operator in a bubble of hospitable conditions. That means divers using a suit like this feel the same pressure that you and I do here on the surface of the planet, and they don\u2019t have to be placed in a decompression chamber immediately after a dive.\nSuch suits have existed for over a hundred years \u2014 early models looked more like  a Big Daddy than the Exosuit \u2014 but this latest version is lighter and allows for more precise movements. That\u2019s thanks to 18 rotary joints, highlighted in red, that allow the diver to maneuver their arms and legs. And despite the suit\u2019s size, \"it's basically effortless to pilot in the water,\" according to the American Museum of Natural History\u2019s dive safety officer Michael Lombardi, who\u2019s trained with the system and will be conducting the deep-sea dives later this year. A diver could technically swim with his limbs in the suit, but it\u2019s equipped with four 1.6 horsepower thrusters that assist with movement. The Exosuit is also safer and more capable than prior models: it\u2019s connected by a tether to a boat on the surface, but it carries enough battery power and oxygen to keep the diver alive underwater for 50 hours.\n\"We feel like we're walking on the moon, because there's just a handful of studies in this area\"\nThere\u2019s only one such suit in existence, and it\u2019s owned by a contracting company called J.F. White. It\u2019s currently on display at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York through March 5th, and the museum held an event this week to mark the suit\u2019s arrival. The $600,000 ensemble has already seen some action in commercial areas since it was completed in 2012, including a mission to work on  the massive water tunnels that serve New York City . But this summer\u2019s Barlow Bluewater Expedition off the coast of New England will be its first scientific endeavor.\nThe goals of the expedition are twofold. Scientists led by John Sparks, a curator at the AMNH, are hoping to observe strange bioluminescent fish that use chemical reactions to emit distinguishing light patterns. Key to Sparks\u2019 studies is the question of how fish diversified down in these dark expanses of the ocean, where there are no physical barriers to prevent cross-breeding. He believes that unique light displays helped pair mates and keep species from converging over time. \"If we can image or video unique flashing patterns for the different species, then we know that they're using this light to communicate with each other,\" Sparks told reporters at the AMNH event.\nTo find out, Lombardi will use the Exosuit equipped with a suction tool to capture interesting specimens. The fish will then be stuck in a \"cartridge\" and placed in front of an extremely sensitive camera attached to a remotely operated vehicle, called the DeepReef-ROV, that will accompany Lombardi on the mission. A fiber-optic tether will share data with scientists on the surface, and they\u2019ll be able to prod the fish and examine its flashing behavior by shining their own lights on the specimen.\nBut that\u2019s only the start: researchers also hope the fish can help understand the human brain. A group, led by neurobiologist Vincent Pieribone of Yale University, is working on harvesting the bioluminescent proteins in these fish to help see how their brains work. In the lab, they combine and mutate engineered proteins with DNA so that the proteins will respond to electric activity in the cell. With these modifications, they can \"in essence read out the electrical activity of a structure, a brain, or an organism,\" Pieribone says. \"By just shining the correct light on it you can see the cells fire.\" With his probes, scientists can actually see brain activity thanks to flashes from these bioluminescent proteins. In the future, Pieribone plans to use this knowledge to help patients with brain injuries interact with machines and robotic tools, allowing them to be more independent.\nTo get there, he needs the right proteins first, and since scientists are unable to recreate them in the lab, Pieribone is going straight to the source. \"We have just exhausted the capability of doing it engineering-wise, but you go into the ocean and it's already been done. It's billions of years of evolution.\"\nAs for the dive itself, Lombardi says he expects to be at depth for three to five hours at a time, compared to just minutes for some of the wet dives he\u2019s performed in the past to snatch biofluorescent fish. \"On one dive, I spent seven minutes at depth and came back with a new species, and so now I can spend five hours at depth... It changes the game.\"\n","Title":"The 530-pound Exosuit is a submarine you can wear | The Verge","Tags":["report","science"]}
