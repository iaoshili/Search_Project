{"Main text":"Samsung's CES TV event got pretty weird\nSwan Lake meets Tron, in a swimming pool\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast night I attended a Samsung pre-CES event at which the company showed off its new UHD TV lineup. The TVs themselves are screamingly beautiful, as you\u2019d expect. As you might also expect, the event itself was truly bizarre. It simply does not get more CES than a Samsung TV event.\nAt the equivalent event two years ago , I saw Samsung imprison women in metal dresses that doubled as cocktail and cupcake stands. Last year , an acrobat dangled from the ceiling as she shakily served champagne. And this year? Well, this year Samsung floated some models in a swimming pool, covered them in blue lights, and instructed them to gracefully wave their arms in some sort of twisted Tron-meets-Swan-Lake fantasy.\nIt's almost as if some hot TVs aren\u2019t enough to grab attention alone.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nOutside, this glowing installation was our only clue as to the delights contained within. \"Shirring\" in particular had us scratching our heads and checking our dictionary apps.\nThe event got off to an inauspicious start \u2014 Samsung apparently thinks I work for About.com.\nThis was the opulent scene that greeted us as we entered.\nSometimes the models would float too close to the edge of the pool and someone had to push them back out.\nI do wonder if Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura, joint winners of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on inventing blue LEDs, had this in mind when achieving their world-changing breakthrough.\nJust in case you forget you're in Vegas, the Foxtail lets you see part of the city's subtle, inoffensive skyline.\nSamsung's HS Kim takes the makeshift stage and continues the Tron theme.\nLadies in the water look on as the screen folds away to reveal another screen.\nSome companies simply tell you the names of their products. Samsung projects them onto giant buildings.\nAt one point Kim proposed a toast to the existence of 4K itself. Some people joined in.\nInside, another Samsung exec preaches the 4K gospel.\nSignposts direct attendees to demos designed to show off how the new TVs are describable by various adjectives beginning with S.\nIt frankly would not be a TV event at CES without a DJ.\nSamsung's Tizen-powered smart TV interface.\nThe Tizen platform allows for games like Just Dance \u2014 no console required. Attendees seemed reluctant to try it out, for some reason.\nIf you insist on starting every description of your product with a single letter, I suppose there are worse choices than \"S.\"\n","Title":"Samsung's CES TV event got pretty weird | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","photo-essay","tech","ces-2015"]}
