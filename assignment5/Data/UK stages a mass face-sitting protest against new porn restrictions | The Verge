{"Main text":"UK stages a mass face-sitting protest against new porn restrictions\nProtestors say the UK government's new regulations are sexist\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n\"I\u2019ve never done this before with my trousers on!\"\nA comment from one of the participants in the UK\u2019s first ever face-sitting protest sets the tone for the afternoon. It\u2019s a first for all involved, with 21 pairs of face-sitters and face-sittees gathered outside the Houses of Parliament to protest against the introduction of new porn censorship laws.\nActivities like female ejaculation, spanking, caning, fisting, and \u2014 yes \u2014 face-sitting are all being subjected to new restrictions, with regulator  ATVOD (the Authority for Television on Demand) calling for strict guidelines that bring the laws for adult video-on-demand sites in line with those for R18 DVDs sold in licensed sex shops. ATVOD says it's merely ironing out \" a regulatory inconsistency ,\" but the protesters say it\u2019s censorship.\n\"Can anyone define \u2018aggressive whipping\u2019? If I'm whipping you with a smile on my face, do I look aggressive?\"\n\"The government  claims that this law is needed to ensure consistency, but who do they think they are in taking our rights away to view legal and consensual sex online?\" says Charlotte Rose , the protest\u2019s organizer, a sexual rights campaigner, and  Sex Worker of the Year 2013 . \"Can anyone define \u2018aggressive whipping\u2019? If I'm whipping you with a smile on my face, do I look aggressive?\"\nFor regulators and protestors alike, the devil\u2019s in the details.  Myles Jackman , a lawyer specializing in obscenity and pornography who supports the protest, points out that it's a bureaucratic nightmare. For example, under the new regulations, porn involving \"purpose-designed fucking-machines\" is acceptable, the use of standard power tools is not \"since most people have one lying around at home.\"\nSimilar caveats are being applied to fisting (okay \u2018up to the last knuckle\u2019) and female ejaculation (\"acceptable if not performed onto another person and\/or then consumed\"), with regulators saying they\u2019re only worried about porn consumers copying these acts and hurting themselves. Pete Johnson, chief executive of ATVOD, says that he blames \"grossly inaccurate accounts\" of the new law for the outrage, with some articles from the UK media falsely describing the acts affected as being \" outlawed outright .\"\n\"There is no ban on face sitting,\" Johnson tells The Verge. \"What there is, is a concern on a deliberate focus on the restriction of blood or oxygen to the brain because its potentially fatal.\" He\u2019s also keen to stress that there\u2019s no gender bias or \"bias against activities associated with particular sexual preferences.\" However, this is a difficult line to take, especially when comparing the restrictions placed on the depiction of female ejaculation and the freedom concerning male ejaculation (consuming this ejaculate is okay). ATVOD says it's because it can\u2019t draw the line between female ejaculation and urination, but the protestors say it's an attack on female sexual agency regardless.\nRegulators say porn can't look dangerous - protesters say that's what makes it porn\nAlthough the popular line taken by some protesters \u2014 that politicians are trying to make everyone as sexually repressed as they are \u2014 is unconvincing, many participating in the mass face-sitting note that the appearance of danger is sometimes integral to this type of pornography. \"I think that part of the point of that type of image is that it has to look like someone\u2019s maybe in peril and is being dominated,\" says Sebastian Bird, a software developer and self-described submissive who came out to protest. \"One of the reasons given [for the law] is to protect children or young people from porn, but they\u2019re not actually targeting the free sources of porn these children are all watching: the tube sites.\"\nFor protest organizer Rose, though, even partial restrictions are censorship enough. \"This is absolutely ludicrous that this was done secretly behind closed doors without the public being aware,\" she shouts from the steps of a historic monument, surrounded by a huge press scrum. \"Did I consent to this? Did you consent to this? This affects our sexual freedom. The freedom to express yourself in the things we enjoy and consent to.\"\nAfter the speeches, Rose corrals the crowd, lining up participants and making sure there are yoga mats and blankets for all on the cold paving stones. Everyone is laughing and smiling as they pair up, some posing for the cameras and others for selfies. An onlooker shouts \"For the love of God, someone sit on that poor fella's face!\" as the last couples arrange themselves. Finally, the hymn sheets are handed out and a rousing rendition of Monty Python's \" Sit on my Face \" begins. Some of the voices are a little muffled \u2014 but at least they're being heard.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nVerge Video Archives: What is the Future of Sex?\n","Title":"UK stages a mass face-sitting protest against new porn restrictions | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","photo-essay","us-world"]}
