{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft and Barnes & Noble unveiled a  \"strategic partnership\" back in April 2012 which involved the software maker investing $300 million for a stake in a separate digital Nook business. Two years later, Barnes & Noble is now buying back Microsoft\u2019s 17.6 percent stake for $62 million and around 2.7 million Barnes & Noble shares, a clear loss on Microsoft\u2019s original investment. Barnes & Noble revealed the purchased in a document filed with the SEC today, and it\u2019s not immediately clear why Microsoft is selling its stake. A company spokesperson says \"as the respective business strategies of each company evolved, we mutually agreed that it made sense to terminate the agreement.\"\nAt the time of the original deal, it appeared to be a move from Microsoft to position itself with an ecosystem to compete in the e-reader business, but very little has resulted from the partnership. A Nook  Windows 8 reading app launched , but Microsoft-powered e-readers were never promised and never launched. Earlier this year,  Samsung and Barnes & Noble partnered to create a co-branded device called the Galaxy Tab 4 Nook running Android, the first sign of life in the Nook lineup of ebook readers and tablets for  quite some time .\nUpdate (9:50AM ET): article updated to include Microsoft's statement.\n","Title":"Microsoft sells its stake in Nook back to Barnes & Noble | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","business","tech"]}
