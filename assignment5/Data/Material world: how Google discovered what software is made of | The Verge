{"Main text":"593 Comments\n\u201CIt is a sufficiently advanced form of paper as to be indistinguishable from magic.\u201D\nMatias Duarte, vice president of design at Google, is telling me about the central principle of Material Design. It\u2019s the unifying metaphor behind Google\u2019s new design direction, providing a unified set of physics and rules for how software should look and act. It\u2019s also a little weird.\nThe design team at Google felt the need to come up with a more coherent look and feel that could be applied across all of its products, from Android to Chrome OS to the web. Rather than starting with a palette of colors or a big set of guidelines, they started with a question.\nWhat is software made of?\nMatter and form\nThe answer came from a design exploration, when Jon Wiley, principal designer for search, and his colleague Nicholas Jitkoff were looking at the now-ubiquitous cards that Google started using in Google Now. They looked at those sliding cards and wondered: when you swiped one away, what was underneath?\n\"It's colorful in a way that the logo is colorful.\"\n\"It sounds like such an innocent question,\" Duarte says, \"and yet it was such a powerful spark.\" It led the team to come up with a new way of thinking about the software elements we use and (virtually) touch every day. Instead of just talking about pixels on a screen or abstract layers, the team imagined that these cards and the surfaces they slid around on were actually real, tangible objects.\nIf these cards were an actual material with its own physical properties, that would mean there would be rules for how they must act and move on the screen. You couldn\u2019t do anything you wanted with them, just like you can\u2019t just do anything with physical objects.\nSo the team set about creating this metaphorical material, which is a little bit like magical paper. It\u2019s flat, it floats slightly above the surface of the background, it tends to be white. There are consistent drop shadows, and a consistent light source illuminating them. Things tend to not just vanish when you move them, but slide away. They don\u2019t shuffle around on their own, but only move when a user moves them.\nCombined with the decision to move towards bolder, brighter color choices and larger typography, the material and the look of it were the seeds from which the rest of the design grew. You can see the first implementation of it in Android L: it has a variety of colors and sheets that slide around and over each other, but still give you a sense of place and consistency.\nWiley and Jitkoff say that this new aesthetic is more of an evolution of Google\u2019s design philosophy than an about-face. In 2012 and 2013, Google embarked on a design initiative called Project Kennedy , which began the process of unifying design across the company. Now, with Material Design, it\u2019s about moving it forward. \"As a whole the platform conveys this feeling of polychromacy,\" Jitkoff says, \"it\u2019s colorful in a way that the logo is colorful, it\u2019s simple in a way that the front page is simple.\"\nCreativity and constraint\nMaterial Design \"unified us in our thinking,\" Duarte says, admitting that \"it\u2019s absolutely a constraint.\" These constraints, he says, made design decisions easier and more consistent. Take, for example, the idea of flipping a card over to see what\u2019s on the back. In Material Design\u2019s world, that\u2019s a cheat that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s as if the software is actual, physical stuff inside these devices, and there\u2019s not space inside a phone to flip a card over, so Google doesn\u2019t allow itself to do it.\nWe\u2019re hardwired to comprehend physical things, Duarte says, and software all too often behaves in ways that break with our models and expectations. Wiley thinks of it as breaking the suspension of disbelief, as when something happens in a sci-fi movie that doesn\u2019t follow its own internal logic. Duarte is a little more direct, with a subtle dig at Apple\u2019s iOS and its flying software layers: \"We\u2019re not hurtling you through space at high speeds,\" he says. \"We\u2019re not puncturing your hand with invisible, impossible surfaces.\"\n\"Design is all about finding solutions within constraints,\" Duarte says, \"If there were no constraints, it\u2019s not design \u2014 it\u2019s art.\"\n\"Design is all about finding solutions within constraints.\"\nGoogle\u2019s designers steadfastly refuse to name the new fictional material, a decision that simultaneously gives them more flexibility and adds a level of metaphysical mysticism to the substance. That\u2019s also important because while this material follows some physical rules, it doesn\u2019t fall into the old trap of skeuomorphism. The material isn\u2019t a one-to-one imitation of physical paper, but instead it\u2019s \"magical,\" as Duarte puts it.\nIt can do things that physical paper can\u2019t, like grow and shrink with animations. Those animations were important to Google, because they help users understand where they are inside an app. \"A lot of software \u2026 kind of feels like television or film in terms of jump cuts,\" Wiley says, causing you to lose your sense of time and place. For apps, you want something more akin to a stage play. \"It\u2019s going from one moment to the next,\" he says, \"that scene change, and what\u2019s happening onstage is choreographed and transitioned, and there\u2019s meaning.\"\nMaterialize\nThe other, more important thing that this material can do is appear when you need it. Google has been working on the algorithms behind products like Google Now for years , and it\u2019s become an essential part of this new design philosophy. Instead of asking users to manage their data, Material Design is asking users to trust that Google will show them what they need at the right time.\n\"With watches, you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time interacting with it.\"\nThat\u2019s why the Android Wear smartwatch software doesn\u2019t give users the ability to do much except respond to notifications. Alex Faaborg, the designer for the platform, says, \"With watches, you don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time interacting with it. You just want to be able to glance down and see information and quickly do a voice command.\" He says it\u2019s \"in the same spirit as a lot of the work that we did for Google now, but it\u2019s for the entire platform.\"\nThat\u2019s a lot of trust to put into Google and into its magical paper material, but Duarte says there\u2019s a reason for that. \"We did it in order to come up with the most simple solution. One of the design practices that we like to follow is try to design the simplest possible thing for the user first. See if you can get away with that, prove that you need more complexity before you add it.\"\nParc 3.0\nThere\u2019s more ambition behind Material Design than just bringing a consistent look and feel across Google\u2019s software and webpages. It\u2019s bigger than Android L, bigger than Android Wear. It\u2019s about the relationship between the metaphors we use to think about computers and the technologies we use to interact with them.\nMaterial Design is about much more than Android\nDuarte points to \"the brilliant work that Xerox Parc did with windows that could overlap and mice that point and click, [it was] groundbreaking.\" But it wasn\u2019t groundbreaking because it was a virtualized version of a real desktop, but instead because it \"had object relationships.\" That meant that people could form a model of how the world of the computer worked and make sense of it. Apple did a similar thing with touchscreens, moving us past point-and-click to a world where we could directly touch and swipe elements.\nNow Google believes it has a software design model that moves us forward yet again. Wiley points to the multiplicity of input technologies we have available to us today: touchscreens, gestures, voice commands, even Google\u2019s own intelligent algorithms. They all need to combine to give our brains a model of how software works, one that functions across devices to help us intuitively interact with anything we encounter.\nMaterial Design is the framework that Google believes creates that model. It\u2019s too much to say that it\u2019s as revolutionary as Xerox\u2019s desktop model or even Apple\u2019s iPhone. But it does seem to have the necessary combination of simplicity and flexibility to help us make sense of the new technologies that we\u2019re being assaulted with every day. And if Google can actually make good on its promise to implement it across the web, Chrome OS, and Android, it will help us transition between them without having to reorient our cognitive models of what software is and how it works.\nRight now, Material Design is only just an idea, and it will remain as fictive as the mystical substance it\u2019s based on until Google actually ships more software that uses it. But as Wiley points out, \"We\u2019re at the very beginning of this.\" And Google is busy setting itself up for whatever comes next.\n\"What if we could design for the materials of the future instead of the materials of today?\" Duarte asks. \"That future is right around the corner.\"\n","Title":"Material world: how Google discovered what software is made of | The Verge","Tags":["google","report","design","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5606171"]}
