{"Main text":"This massive 3D-printed model shows off San Francisco in amazing detail\n115 blocks of a neighborhood undergoing constant change\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVirtual 3D models of cities are nothing new, but bringing one into the physical world is a bit more challenging. AutoCAD maker Autodesk and creative marketing agency Steelblue did just that, however, with this massive, incredibly detailed 3D print of San Francisco\u2019s SOMA neighborhood. All told, it encompases more than 115 city blocks, mainly in the northeast part of San Francisco\u2019s 7-by-7 mile footprint.\nThe map covers a number of the city\u2019s landmarks, including AT&T Park (home of the Giants), the Bay Bridge, and the San Francisco Ferry Building \u2014 but perhaps more importantly, it covers what is probably the city\u2019s most rapidly changing area in terms of real estate. The 3D print was designed for real estate developer Tishman Speyer to help the company with urban planning and construction decisions \u2014 each block of the map can be picked up and replaced to help developers see exactly what new construction will look like in the context of the neighborhood. In fact, a section of the map shows SOMA not as it is now, but as it\u2019ll look in 2017 when a number of major construction projects are finalized.\nThe model becomes really useful with the addition of a projector mounted over the map: developers can overlay data like street maps, future subway lines, traffic patterns, or simply color outlines to highlight different parts of the city. Right now, that involves a pretty elaborate setup, with the projector mounted high above on the ceiling, but Autodesk and Steelblue also built a translucent prototype, which would allow images to be projected from below the map.\nBeyond its utility for developers and urban planners, the map is an impressive piece of art in its own right \u2014 there\u2019s an incredible amount of detail in each of the dozens of blocks that make up this part of San Francisco. I happen to live in an area captured by the map, and the amount of detail poured into the buildings that I see every day when walking around the city truly brings the model to life. The print was done at a resolution of 16 microns, which made reproducing minute details possible \u2014 you can pick out individual seating sections in AT&T Park, for example.\nRight now, there\u2019s only one copy of the map, and it\u2019ll be in possession of the real estate developer whom it was built for \u2014 but Autodesk plans to print another and have it available for viewing at its gallery. Steelblue and Autodesk also have plans to print other cities \u2014 and possibly expand on the San Francisco map, as well. We\u2019ll have to see how they\u2019ll tackle the city\u2019s famous up-and-down topography, however \u2014 most neighborhoods in San Francisco are a lot hillier than SOMA.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe view from AT&T Park, looking north towards San Francisco's financial district.\nAT&T Park, in detail.
