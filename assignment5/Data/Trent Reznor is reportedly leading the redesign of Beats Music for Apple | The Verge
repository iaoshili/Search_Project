{"Main text":"Trent Reznor is reportedly leading the redesign of Beats Music for Apple\nYou're going to get what you deserve, hopefully\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNine Inch Nails frontman, Oscar-winning soundtrack composer, and new Apple employee Trent Reznor appears to be no mere figurehead over in Cuptertino. According to a new report from The New York Times, Reznor has been given a \"major role\" in redesigning the Beats Music service that Apple purchased last year. While there weren't many details on what exactly Reznor is working on, he was described as the \"point man\" for Apple's efforts at relaunching Beats Music under its own brand.\nReznor had previously been with Beats Music as its chief creative officer and  gave some insight into his role at Apple last October, saying he was \"fully in it right now, and it's challenging, and it's unfamiliar, and it's kind of everything I asked for \u2014 and the bad thing is it's everything I asked for.\" To get Beats Music ready to go, Reznor is working with Beats and Apple employees including Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, who works under Apple's head of software and internet service Eddie Cue. Whether Apple's design head Jony Ive is involved in the Beats Music relaunch is unclear, though we'd expect the new service to fall in line with the visual redesign to Apple's software that has rolled out over the last few years under Ive's direction.\nReznor's fingerprints will be all over Apple's biggest streaming music effort yet\nThe Times also rehashed a number of details surrounding Apple's relaunch of Beats Music that have already been revealed, including Apple's desire to have exclusive content on iTunes and the plan to  include it in the next major version of iOS . It also backed up earlier reports that Apple attempted to price its new service at $7.99 per month, undercutting many competitors by $2. The record labels  apparently pushed back , and now it seems Apple will stay in line at $9.99 per month when its service launches.\nApple is also planning to revamp its somewhat lackluster iTunes Radio service to go alongside the Beats relaunch, though it sounds like what exactly will change isn't yet set in stone.  Recent Apple hire Zane Lowe , formerly a DJ at BBC Radio 1, is reportedly involved and may even serve as a more traditional DJ on iTunes Radio on new, geographically targeted stations \u2014 similar to more traditional FM radio. That would likely be in addition to the current, genre-based station offerings that accompany the custom artist- and song-based stations that users can create themselves. There's no word on when we'll see Apple's efforts, but WWDC 2015 in June seems like a safe bet.\n","Title":"Trent Reznor is reportedly leading the redesign of Beats Music for Apple | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
