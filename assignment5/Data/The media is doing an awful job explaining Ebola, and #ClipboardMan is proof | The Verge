{"Main text":"\u2014 The Russo (@FootballRusso58) October 16, 2014\nThe vitriol seemed directly linked to the media's take on #ClipboardMan's attire. The Telegraph, for instance, published  a video of the event that told viewers that this was both a \"breach of protocol\" and \"an embarrassment for the [US] government.\"\nCredit: Telegraph\nBut here's the thing: although #ClipboardMan could be wearing more protection \u2014 gloves and a face mask wouldn't hurt \u2014 he doesn't look like he's touching Vinson. He doesn't look like he's touching the people wearing protection either. So if what we see in the video is all that happened, #ClipboardMan's risk of getting infected doesn't appear to be very high. After all, Ebola isn't airborne. It can only be transmitted by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of someone who's showing symptoms. Vinson, of course, has been showing symptoms for a few days now, but if she isn't projectile vomiting, and #ClipboardMan isn't going out of his way to touch things she has also touched, this probably isn't a big deal.\nHe isn't touching Vinson or the people wearing protective gear\nStill, this form of reasoning doesn't explain why he wasn't wearing a suit in the first place. Fortunately,  ABC News took the time to dig up some information. As it turns out, biohazard suits aren't just  hard to remove , they're also hard to see through. #ClipboardMan is the medical protocol supervisor charged with making sure that the people wearing protective gear don't accidentally trip over something, or touch a surface they shouldn't.\n\"Our medical professionals in the biohazard suits have limited vision and mobility and it is the protocol supervisor's job to watch each person carefully and give them verbal directions to insure no close contact protocols are violated,\" a spokesperson from Phoenix Air, the airline used to transport Vinson to Atlanta, told ABC News.\n\"it is the protocol supervisor's job to watch each person carefully.\"\nThis is a perfectly reasonable explanation for #ClipboardMan's lack of protective gear. He was making sure everyone else was being careful. Yet multiple news outlets rushed to point out his clipboard without supplying readers with an explanation. Ebola is a scary, gruesome disease, so it's only natural that some people are concerned, especially given  past \"breaches in protocol\" in Dallas. But that's why we need reporters to help people make sense of it all (Fox News' Shepard Smith is a  great example ). They have a responsibility to stop unnecessary panic \u2014 to explain why Ebola isn't easy to catch in the US \u2014 instead of causing further alarm with unfinished stories and inaccurate statements.\n","Title":"The media is doing an awful job explaining Ebola, and #ClipboardMan is proof | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","science","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
