{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThat brief appearance in Prometheus sounds like the last we're going to see of Alien's Xenomorph. \"The beast is done. Cooked,\" director Ridley Scott  tells Yahoo Movies . \"I got lucky meeting [H.R.] Giger all those years ago. It's very hard to repeat that.\" Scott says that a sequel to Prometheus, which was set before the events of the other four Alien films, is currently being written. We've been hearing about the sequel for some time, and Scott has previously said that a  script was completed , though now he's got \"15 drafts evolving.\" Actors Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace are said to be returning. But Scott seems tired of the series' most recognizable creature.\nAfter four movies (plus two Alien vs. Predator crossovers), \"I think it wears out a little bit. There's only so much snarling you can do. I think you've got to come back with something more interesting.\" Scott says the Engineers from Prometheus were a good start, but it seems unlikely that he'll find another Giger \u2014 a groundbreaking artist in his own right \u2014 to create anything as memorable as the Alien. After his upcoming film Exodus: Gods and Kings and an adaptation of 2012 novel The Martian, Scott will be taking on  an equally tall order : a sequel to his classic film Blade Runner.\n","Title":"Ridley Scott says the Alien isn't coming back | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
