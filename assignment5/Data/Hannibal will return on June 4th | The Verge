{"Main text":"Hannibal will return on June 4th\nThe show is also moving from Friday to Thursday\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNBC's serial killer thriller Hannibal will  return on June 4th for its third season. It will also be moving from the Friday night graveyard slot to Thursday nights.\nHannibal revolves around the relationship between FBI investigator Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen), a character popularized in 1991's Silence of the Lambs. Graham is charged with solving a series of murders while Lecter tracks his moves with eerie precision.\nSeason 2 ended in a cliffhanger that left the show's adoring \" fannibals \" waiting breathlessly for answers. From the trailer above, it looks like we can expect more twisted, nail-biting suspense and lots of shadowy figures.\nThe series premiere will air on NBC at 10 PM ET.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
