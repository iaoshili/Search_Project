{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Legend of Zelda is coming to Netflix. According to a recent report , the streaming company is working closely with Nintendo to adapt the classic franchise for the small screen. It'll even look and feel a bit like Game of Thrones, but for families. (Which means, obviously, less gratuitous nudity and bloodshed.)\nNetflix is reportedly still in the process of finding writers for the series, so it's anyone's guess what the final product will actually look like when it debuts. Well, after hours of deliberation, joking, and serious thoughts about representation, The Verge knows exactly how the series should look from a casting standpoint. Why did we spend hours on this? Because a) it's fun and b) it matters to think about who will be playing these iconic characters. We know it's not up to us \u2014 especially since so many of those below are busy A-list actors \u2014 but a site can dream. Let the casting commence!\nMaisie Williams as Young Link\nAs evidenced by her winning performance in Game of Thrones, Maisie Williams is already brilliant at playing youths fighting their way through high fantasy worlds, so we're sure she's willing to set forth on a quest to save the princess of her kingdom. If we had to guess, she pretty much already bears the Tri-Force of Courage. And as for why we would make Link, Zelda's love interest, a girl instead of a boy, it's because it doesn't matter either way.\nHBO\nNatalie Dormer as Adult Link\nNatalie Dormer is a badass. While we haven't yet seen her wield a sword as Margaery Tyrell or Cressida in The Hunger Games, she just has the kind of presence where you don't want to mess with her. Imagine her emerging from the Temple of Time, Master Sword in hand. Yeah. Badass.\nGetty Images\nQuvenzhané Wallis as Young Zelda\nZelda on Netflix should be tough, no matter how old she is. The 11-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis already has an Academy Award nomination to her name for playing the unstoppable Hushpuppy in 2012's Beasts of the Southern Wild. We imagine her playing a smart, resourceful, and funny Zelda is the same vein as Tetra from Wind Waker.\nTumblr\nAntonia Thomas as Adult Zelda\nAntonia Thomas was incredible as Alisha in Britain's Misfits, playing a complex character far beyond any typical damsel in distress. She's strong, smart, and has something of a regal aura about her. (Even if that might come across as bratty.) We think she'd play a pretty excellent Princess Zelda, and an even more brilliant Sheik when it came down to it.\nJosh Jenson\/Flickr\nMichael Shannon as Ganondorf\nThis is really a no-brainer. Michael Shannon played Zod in Man of Steel and Nelson Van Alden in Boardwalk Empire with the same kind of simmering intensity ready to flip right over into savagery. He's a reasonable man until he has to be a cruel and utterly brutal one. Cast him out into the desert and redden his hair, and we have no problem imagining him as the Gerudo King of Thieves.\nWarner Bros.\nLaurence Fishburne as King Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule\nThe King of Red Lions was a big part of Wind Waker's epic scope, and discovering that he was the old King of Hyrule all along made the game feel like the stuff of myth. You can always count on Laurence Fishburne for Shakespearean gravitas, the kind of reading that makes you think you're listening to something momentous. He'd play the perfect ruler of Hyrule.\nCleftClips\/Flickr\nJenny Slate as Navi\nNavi may be annoying, but Navi is necessary. If she had a voice actress, the woman behind  Marcel the Shell is a shoe-in. She'd make the fairy truly endearing. It just works.\nGage Skidmore\/Flickr\nZoe Saldana as Midna\nMidna's more mischievous than Navi ever was, but she makes up for it by being the Twilight Princess. We imagine Zoe Saldana playing Midna in her full-grown Twili form, wielding the Mirror of Twilight like a weapon when she's not brokering diplomatic ties with Hyrule.\nBeyoncé as The Fairy Queen\nThis really needs no explanation other than Beyoncé is already American royalty. Ruling the Fae should be no problem.\nAlan Light\/Flickr\nMargaret Cho as The Great Fairy of Magic\nIf you're at all familiar with Margaret Cho's oeuvre, you'll know why this make sense. The Great Fairies of Magic are larger-than-life, sexy, weird, and ultra-powerful women charged with giving Link upgrades. Imagine Cho floating in midair, in thigh-high boots, a red wig, and covered in vines, and you'll realize this is the role she was made for.\nUMBC Student Events Board\/Flickr\nNick Offerman as Darunia\nNetflix should look no further than the man who plays Parks & Rec's \"big boss,\" Nick Offerman. Not only is the NBC sitcom is about to wrap its final season, but he'd be the perfect fit for the roll of the burly, gruff, rock-eating patriarch of the Gorons. He's got the great facial hair. He's comfortable without his shirt on. And he's spent over six seasons playing a character who buries gold, so he's ready to go should the series call for Darunia to hoard the Goron's Ruby (aka the Spiritual Stone of Fire).\nGetty Images\n","Title":"Here's what the ideal cast of Netflix's Legend of Zelda would be | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
