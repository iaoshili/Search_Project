{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA Satanist statue cast in bronze is just months away from completion, and activists hope that it will find a home on the lawn of the Oklahoma State Capitol. Ultimately, the statue \u2014 which features the seven-foot tall, horned figure of Baphomet fawned upon by two exultant children \u2014 is intended to stand directly next to a highly controversial monument of the ten commandments that was donated by a state legislator in 2012 and subsequently placed on the grounds of the Capitol.\nThe Baphomet figure, complete with a goat head, angel wings, and a beard, comes from a recently-formed New York group identifying as The Satanic Temple, which  raised over $28,000 on Indiegogo earlier this year to commission a sculptor and create the piece. Satanic Temple spokesperson Lucian Greaves  tells ABC News that the statue is a symbol to \"celebrate our progress as a pluralistic nation founded on secular law.\"\nWe're just now getting our first look at the what the statue will look like, thanks to images of the mold released by The Satanic Temple this week. Unfortunately for the group's activist aims, there hasn't been much progress on securing a spot for the statue at the Capitol in Oklahoma, one of the most Christian states in the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is currently challenging the ten commandments statue in court on grounds that it violates the Constitution's \"establishment clause\" against a national religion, and Oklahoma has prohibited applications for additional statues pending the completion of that case.\nGreaves has made it clear that the group would no longer petition to have the statue installed should the ten commandments monument be removed, but he isn't concerned about finding somewhere else to place the statue should they fail to get permission in Oklahoma. \"There are no shortage of public locations across the US where religious monuments await a contrasting voice,\" he  tells Vice , which first published photos of the statue. And they're prepared should demonstrators destroy the statue: they're holding onto the cast and plan to take out an insurance policy on the statue.\n","Title":"Satanic group reveals crowdfunded monument for Oklahoma State Capitol | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
