{"Main text":"This sleek electric bike is wonderful and could be real, if you vote for it\nA clever concept with smart lights and a built-in lock\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA team of designers in Seattle are building a bike that could be your new best option for navigating busy city streets. Called the Denny, the bike concept includes a number of clever features that make it a bit more useful than your average two-wheeler. Not only does it have a removable electric motor to give you a bit of a boost, as well as automatic gear shifting, but its detachable handlebar doubles as a lock, so you never have to worry about bringing one along.\nThe bike also includes a surprisingly robust lighting set-up: there are integrated turn signals and head and brake lights, as well as smart, reactive lights that turn on based on the lighting outside. \"The Denny bike is about returning the rider (and ourselves) to those early days of carefree riding,\" explain the creators, \"when cycling was just about \u2018get up and go' freedom; the reason we all fell in love with bikes in the first place.\"\nWhether or not the bike ever makes it to production remains to be seen. Right now it's just a prototype, and the Denny is one of five entries in the Oregon Manifest bike design project, which tasks designers from cities across the US to build their own take on a bike of the future. A concept out of New York features a built-in USB charging station, for instance, while a prototype from Portland has a 3D printed titanium frame. You canÂ  vote on your favorite , and the winning design will be manufactured by Fuji Bikes, for an expected retail debut in 2015.\n","Title":"This sleek electric bike is wonderful and could be real, if you vote for it | The Verge","Tags":["concepts","design"]}
