{"Main text":"Louis C.K. wants to die 'in a terrible way' in the new Alien movie\nSigourney Weaver says the comedian might want a role in the film\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYesterday we learned that District 9 director Neill Blomkamp  would helm the upcoming Alien movie , but there was little in the way of solid details. Now it looks like we might know at least one actor attached to the film: Louis C.K.\nLast night Sigourney Weaver stopped by The Tonight Show to promote the sci-fi police state movie Chappie, also directed by Blomkamp, and Jimmy Fallon couldn't help but probe her for some Alien gossip. While Weaver didn't say for sure if she'd be involved, she did say Louis C.K. expressed interest in a small role. Weaver recounts C.K. saying, \"I wanna be in it, and I wanna die in a terrible way.\"\nThis is still just a rumor, but let's pretend it's definitely happening. Here are some ways Louis C.K. could die in the Alien universe:\n1. Decapitation by a squawking, toothy extra-terrestrial.\n2. Suffocation brought on by oxygen tank failure in an atmosphere unkind to human respiratory needs.\n3.
