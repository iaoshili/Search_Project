{"Main text":"'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' poster puts exploding building above Sept. 11 release date\nParamount quickly retracts the promo poster featuring the Australian release date for TMNT\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe upcoming Michael Bay-produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is set to open on September 11th in Australia, which was today highlighted by a new promotional poster published to Paramount's Twitter and Facebook streams. The image was quickly retracted, however, after users reacted angrily to the combination of its release date and the artwork above it, depicting the four turtles jumping out of an exploding skyscraper.\nEvoking the tragic events of the World Trade Center attacks in New York 13 years ago was certainly not Paramount's intention, as evidenced by the fact that this particular poster had already been used a week earlier , albeit without the offending opening date. And, unlike  AT&T last year , Paramount's blunderous tweet made the connection accidentally rather than trying to exploit the date to sell its product. Still, it's a significant faux pas for the film studio to make and won't endear the TMNT reboot any more to an audience that's already dubious about  how far it's strayed from the original material.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
