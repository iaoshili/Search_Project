The Rainforest Guardian skyscraper, which gained an honorable mention in eVolo\u2018s 2014 skyscraper competition , is the brainchild of designers Jie Huang, Jin Wei, Giaowan Tang, Yiwei Yu, and Zhe Hao and focuses on collecting and distributing rainwater into the land as needed during the dry and wet seasons.\n\"Firefighter\" aircrafts are like hydration drones\nThe Rainforest Guardian looks like an upside-down tower featuring a flat, circular top with pipes hanging down off of it. It collects water in two ways: catching the rain that falls from the sky, and sucking up the excess water on the ground during the rainy season. The water is then filtered and stored in reservoirs before it's used for either irrigating the land or extinguishing fires. Keeping the ground hydrated should help prevent fires, but if one does start, the skyscraper has \"firefighters\" \u2014 little drone-like aircrafts made with water tanks and spray systems \u2014 it can deploy to help put out the blaze.\nBut the designers want the skyscraper to be more than just a gigantic water jug. They've divided up the space at the top of the structure \u2014 its widest point \u2014 to house different things on separate floors, including the main water reservoir, a research station, a tourist and educational center, and a climate observatory. The structure does so much and looks so futuristic for a reason \u2014 it's only a concept at this point, but it does offer an oddly stunning solution to a growing problem.\n","Title":"Spaceship-like skyscraper fights fires and irrigates Amazon rainforests | The Verge","Tags":["concepts","design","architecture"]}
