{"Main text":"This fake 1980s Ghostbusters anime deserves an entire season\nThe Ghostbusters fight yōkai in this classic cartoon that never was\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor my birthday, my wife bought me a collection of GeGeGe no Kitarō stories, a manga that riffs on Japanese folklore. I'm infatuated with American folklore \u2014 I love everything from Paul Bunyan to the jackalope \u2014 but I'm discovering a chunk of my heart belongs to Japanese folklore, specifically tales about yōkai, which I'll gracelessly reduce to a cross between a ghost and a monster.\nKitarō is half Charlie Brown, half Superman: a gloomy boy hero that keeps peace between humans and his fellow yōkai. I mention my unusual obsession with him and the other spooky stories because I just watched this fan-made intro for a 1980s Ghostbusters anime that never was. In the middle, the Ghostbusters stand toe-to-toe with a gang of yōkai. It's a perfect match up: one wily gang of paranormal fighters versus the shrewd pseudo-ghouls.  Credit goes to Nacho Punch for an inspired idea.\nOf course, this isn't the first time we've seen a Ghostbusters anime.
