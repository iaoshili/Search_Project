{"Main text":"FCC extends comment period for Comcast\u2013TWC merger because Comcast filed a really long document\nA \"voluminous,\" nearly 850-page read\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Federal Communications Commission is extending the time you'll have to file a comment on whether you think that Comcast and Time Warner Cable should be allowed to merge. The reason behind the extension is that Comcast recently filed an enormous document containing new information with the commission. The commission actually refers to the thing as \"voluminous,\" noting that it's nearly 850 pages long.\nYou can read the document when the FCC's site starts working again\nThe commission says that this new document contains information that is \"critical to the review of the proposed transactions,\" and as such, more time is needed for the public to evaluate it. Unfortunately, you probably won't even be able to read the document right now because the FCC's filing system isn't really working.\nRather than closing on October 8th, the period for reply comments on the Comcast-TWC merger will now close on October 29th. Additionally, the FCC is pausing its 180-day \"transaction clock,\" which is a self-imposed timeline that it uses to let the public know when to expect its decision. The clock, which is currently on day 85, will resume on October 29th, once all of the comments are in. New comments can be filed here . In a statement, Comcast says that this pause is not necessarily a sign of trouble and that it tends to occur in large transactions.\n\"It is routine for the FCC to pause the review of significant transactions as it works to create a full record (this happened in our prior transactions as well),\" Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast government communications exec, says in a statement. \"We will work with the staff to determine the additional information the FCC is seeking (including the document production that the FCC had asked us to delay filing) and will submit supplemental answers and documents quickly thereafter so that the FCC can complete its review early in 2015.\"\nAs a reminder, a successful merger would create a combined cable giant with 30 million subscribers who would  have few legitimate alternatives for high-speed internet .\n","Title":"FCC extends comment period for Comcast\u2013TWC merger because Comcast filed a really long document | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5121167"]}
