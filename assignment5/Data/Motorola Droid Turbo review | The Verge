{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAnabolic steroids have been used by athletes, bodybuilders, and others for years to get bigger, go faster, and last longer in competition. They often work \u2014 fantastically so \u2014 but not without detrimental effects to the user\u2019s health, mood, and general well-being. Unsurprisingly, the use of steroids is banned from virtually all athletic competitions all over the world.\nI\u2019m not saying Verizon and Motorola injected the Moto X with anabolic steroids to create the $199 Droid Turbo, but they may as well have. The Turbo takes the Moto X and pushes it to its extremes: it has a faster processor, a higher-res screen, a higher-res camera, and perhaps most importantly, a much larger battery. On paper, the Droid Turbo is everything the Moto X is, only bigger, faster, and longer-lasting.\nBut just as you can\u2019t get juiced up on steroids without any consequences, the Droid Turbo provides a very different experience than the beloved Moto X does. Oftentimes, it\u2019s not any better.\nThe Moto X that Motorola released this year was a fantastic refinement of last year\u2019s design. It\u2019s slim in all the right places, has premium materials, and can even be customized with wood or leather finishes. The X\u2019s design is a big part of what makes it my favorite Android phone of the year.\nWhen I look at the Droid Turbo, I struggle to see any of those design refinements. The Turbo is chunky, heavy, and just plain ugly. (Some of that comes down to the greater weight and thicker profile of the Turbo, both of which are due its massive battery.) The X\u2019s metal frame is gone, replaced by a mundane soft-touch plastic, and the useful on-screen navigation buttons have been swapped for outmoded capacitive keys. Where the X curves, the Turbo is sharp.\nThe Turbo doesn't have any of the refined style of the Moto X\nThere aren\u2019t any customization options \u2014 no wood backs or leather finishes \u2014 for the Turbo, but Verizon is selling it in three different colors. The first two (a glossy black or glossy red) are just ugly, but the third one is unique. Verizon calls it Ballistic Nylon, and it has a textured fabric finish that reminds me of the nylon straps on a backpack. It\u2019s almost like the Turbo is wearing a bulletproof vest, which is probably exactly what Verizon wants you to think based on the ultra-aggressive marketing campaigns for the Droid line. The textured finish provides a little grip and resists getting scratched or dented like other materials, but I\u2019m concerned the fibers will fray over time (and some already have on my review unit). It\u2019s clear Verizon thinks this phone isn\u2019t for the dainty \u2014 it\u2019s heavy and tough and aggressive and projects a far more masculine appearance than Motorola\u2019s other phones.\nWhere the Turbo does seem to take a step forward over the X is with its 5.2-inch display. It\u2019s the same size as the screen on the X, but has a much higher 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution. It\u2019s a lot of pixels, but the screen isn\u2019t noticeably sharper than the X\u2019s 1080p display. I can\u2019t see the individual pixels on either of them, even when I strain my eyes to find them, and I bet you can\u2019t either.\nThe screen is still AMOLED and comes with all of the quirks related to that technology. It has some tinting issues and color shifts, and it could stand to be brighter outdoors, but only the most discerning people will actually have a problem with the Turbo\u2019s screen. Using AMOLED also enables Motorola\u2019s super useful on-screen notifications, which are one of the best parts of Motorola\u2019s smartphones.\nThe Turbo has a front facing speaker, infrared motion sensors, and minimal branding, just like the Moto X. But it lacks all of the personality of the X: the nifty design features, the ergonomic shape, the great-feeling natural materials. It just looks like a phone.\nMotorola and Verizon swapped out the Moto X\u2019s perfectly acceptable 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for a slightly faster 2.7GHz chip in the Turbo. It\u2019s paired with 3GB of RAM, and you can get 32 or 64GB of storage (for a $50 premium).\nIn theory, those upgrades should make the Turbo perform noticeably better than the X, but that hasn\u2019t always been the case. Apps open quickly enough, and the Droid Turbo is certainly fast, but it\u2019s not significantly better than the already-quick X, which makes me wonder why anyone should bother. More troubling is the weird jelly-like effect on the Turbo when scrolling within apps that isn\u2019t present on any other smartphone I\u2019ve used this year.\nAn example of the jelly-like scrolling on the Droid Turbo\nThe Turbo\u2019s camera is significantly higher resolution than the Moto X\u2019s \u2014 21 megapixels vs. 13 \u2014 and it often takes sharper, better photos than the X. But it\u2019s oddly slow: slow to launch, slow to focus, and slow to actually take a picture, which makes it annoying to use. I missed countless shots because my subject (usually my toddler) moved out of frame before the Turbo finally took a picture. Contrasted with the X\u2019s lightning-fast camera, the Turbo is frustrating to take pictures with, even if they often come out looking good. I\u2019d rather have a faster camera that takes decent pictures than a slow camera that takes better ones.\nThe real reason most people will consider the Turbo over the X is for its giant battery. The Turbo has a 3,900mAh cell, one of the largest I\u2019ve ever seen and certainly the biggest among phones in the Turbo\u2019s size class. Verizon and Motorola proudly boast 48 hours of mixed usage between charges, but my real-world tests didn\u2019t quite match that. Over a quiet weekend, I got the Turbo to stretch to 31 hours before kicking the bucket, and on busier days its stamina was closer to 24 hours. Those aren\u2019t shabby numbers by any means (and they are notably better than what I get on the Moto X), but they aren\u2019t exactly mind-blowing or even up to what Verizon and Motorola claim. The Turbo\u2019s battery life is comparable to what I get from a good phablet, like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 4.\n","Title":"Motorola Droid Turbo review | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","review","tech"]}
