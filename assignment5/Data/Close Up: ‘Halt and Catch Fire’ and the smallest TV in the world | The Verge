{"Main text":"21 Comments\nWe love TV and we love recaps, but a lot of times it\u2019s not the big-picture plot developments that make a show great. It\u2019s the little things; the details in the dialogue, set design, props, and performance. With Close Up, we\u2019ll be taking a look at the coolest moments and most interesting details in some of our favorite shows. Today we\u2019re looking at the latest episode of AMC\u2019s period drama Halt and Catch Fire: \u201CAdventure.\u201D\nAfter the near-meltdown that Joe caused last week , things are humming at Cardiff Electric. Joe does his best Ricky Roma to entrance a group of potential retailers, the Wall Street Quarterly article has come out, and expanded software and hardware teams are moving forward and in good spirits. To meet the size and weight goals of the Cardiff portable PC project, Gordon realizes a traditional monitor (by 1983 standards) simply won\u2019t cut it: they need to opt for an LCD screen. Unfortunately, those are pretty pricey, but his father-in-law has an in with a Japanese company that makes some of the best screens in the business. A meeting with the Japanese executives goes awry when Gordon has several whiskeys too many, but he\u2019s able to repair the damage in the end \u2014 though not without undermining Joe\u2019s ever-inflating ego.\nMeanwhile, Joe MacMillan, Sr. has shown up and is trying to meet with his son, but keeps getting blown off. He ends up running into Cameron, and uses some heavy-handed flattery in an attempt to get her on his side \u2014 but Cameron smells his tactics a mile away. That\u2019s not to say she leaves the exchange empty-handed, however.\nAfter Cardiff\u2019s new software manager assigns Cameron to work on printer drivers, she is less than thrilled. But Joe\u2019s dad explains the bloodthirsty way his son climbed the corporate ladder back at IBM, and when Cameron heads back to the office she takes a page straight from the MacMillan playbook. She undermines the new software manager, fires half the team, and using a computer game as an effective object lesson installs her own hand-picked group of coders that she\u2019ll lead herself.\nIf it sounds like the \u201980s...\nIn almost every episode, Halt and Catch Fire makes a point of establishing the time and place with some inspired period music cues . The opening of \"Adventure\" seems to be doing the same with a moody, synth-heavy track that calls to mind early Depeche Mode \u2014 only the song is actually from 2011.\n\"Capsize\" is the work of Big Black Delta, the solo project of Jonathan Bates (Mellowdrone). The band\u2019s spacey, experimental synth-rock seems right at home in the universe of Halt, matching Joe\u2019s existential angst and Cameron\u2019s in-the-groove-and-feeling-it vibe perfectly. The song is from the band\u2019s first full-length album, BBDLP1, though the songs on that record have since been repackaged with some additional tracks and re-released on the eponymous Big Black Delta.\nDon't take the inclusion of \"Capsize\" as a sign that the show is moving away from vintage (and often expensive) music cues, however. Series co-creatorÂ  Christopher Cantwell writes that the episode with the most expensive music budget is still on the horizon.\nThe smallest TV in the world\nGetting a better look at Android Wear was one of the highlights of Google I\/O last week, and Halt and Catch Fire puts it all in context by showing off an early 1980s wrist-worn television. The Seiko TV Watch featured a 1.2-inch screen and a separate TV tuner the size of a Walkman that plucked the television signals out of the air. Users were expected to wear the tuner on their belt, and the screen itself wasn\u2019t actually backlit \u2014 so you\u2019d usually have to be somewhere with decent lighting to get a usable image. At which point you could probably just watch a regular television.\nA 1983 New York Times article about the watch\u2019s launch notes that its $495 price tag was likely too high, and it certainly never took off as a mainstream product \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop it from leaving a cultural impression. The 1984 Guinness Book of World Records named the watch the smallest TV set in the world , and it received the big-screen treatment as one of Q\u2019s special gadgets in the James Bond movie Octopussy.\nNo, not that Lovelace\nWhen Cameron comes back from her business trip, the hardware engineers are bandying about possible codenames for the project \u2014  Death Star and Khan are in the running \u2014 but Cameron steps in and announces it will be called \"Lovelace.\" The engineers snicker, at first thinking it\u2019s a reference to Deep Throat actress Linda Lovelace, but she\u2019s got someone more relevant in mind.\nAda Lovelace was a 19th-century mathematician, the daughter of poet Lord Byron, and is considered the world\u2019s first computer programmer. Early in her career, Lovelace began working alongside Charles Babbage, another English mathematician and engineer who designed mechanical machines to carry out complex calculations. His early designs for \"difference engines,\" as he called them, gave way to a more complex machine for general-purpose computing that he dubbed the Analytical Engine. None of his projects were ever actually constructed \u2014 well, not in his lifetime anyway \u2014 but while working with him Lovelace created what is now considered the first program that could be carried out by a machine. It was Lovelace that saw the potential for computers to become something more than mere number-crunching machines, a vision that set the stage for computers as we know them today \u2014 and one that Google noted on her 197th birthday .\nWould you like to play a game?\nCameron picks her A-team of programmers by finding out who was smart enough, and unorthodox enough, to beat a computer game by diving into its code and figuring out the shortcuts. The game in question is Adventure (also known as Colossal Cave Adventure), and was developed by programmer William Crowther in the mid-\u201970s. Long before graphics were a viable option, Adventure relied on text descriptions to tell the player where they were, and allowed them to type simple commands \u2014 \"go north,\" or \"turn on lantern\" \u2014 to interact with the world. A programmer named Don Woods discovered the game at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and expanded it with Crowley\u2019s consent, releasing what\u2019s often considered to be the definitive version of Adventure in 1977.\nThe title spawned an entire genre of gaming. It led to the creation of Zork, a sprawling, fantasy-laced text adventure that was first distributed on the ARPANET. Seeing potential in computer gaming at home, Zork\u2019s creators helped found Infocom, a company the specialized in what was termed \"interactive fiction.\" Throughout the 1980s Infocom published dozens of text games, including titles like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (created with author Douglas Adams), Planetfall, The Lurking Horror, and Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare.\nAdventure also inspired a young Ken and Roberta Williams. The couple took the core concept of text adventures and added primitive, static graphics to create the early graphic adventure Mystery House. They went on to found On-Line Software \u2014 which eventually became Sierra Online \u2014  and published graphic adventure classics like the King\u2019s Quest and Space Quest series.\nWith the advent of more powerful computers and sophisticated graphics, text adventure games eventually fell by the wayside, but there\u2019s an elegance to them that\u2019s hard to match. Thanks to modern-day interpreters, they\u2019re still playable today \u2014 if you know what corners of the internet to explore.
