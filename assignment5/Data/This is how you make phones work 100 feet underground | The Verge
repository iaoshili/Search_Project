Never mind the fact that you are, at any given moment along its 1.5-mile stretch, surrounded by 21-ton rings of iron and submerged close to 100 feet below the Hudson River: not being able to post a tweet or text a friend in one spot is enough to forget that it was possible just a few feet ago. So what exactly makes it possible?\nLast week, AT&T and the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey brought me down into the center tube of the Lincoln Tunnel with a group of local journalists to answer that question in detail. Simply put, you can tweet from the tunnel thanks to a forward-thinking technological plan that was put in place 20 years ago.\nBack then, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey wanted to help extend the cellular service that AT&T had built out along the nation\u2019s highways. Through a lengthy series of overnight tunnel closures, the two sides worked to install a service called \"leaky coax,\" which was used at the time around the country by police and fire departments to relay communications in places where antenna-boosted signals would have trouble with fidelity. It consists of cables that run the full 8,000 feet of each of the three tunnels. The idea gets its name from the fact that the cables have holes in them that literally \"leak\" the cellular signal into the tunnel.\nIt's not a perfect system\nIt's not perfect, though. \"It\u2019s not very efficient. We use very low-power systems, so the loss over the cables was a real challenge,\" AT&T's Director of Radio Technology Carl Busseno said as we walked around the inside of the tunnel. \"So what we had to do is we had to actually break the system up into four quadrants within the tunnel itself.\"\nTo do this, AT&T installed base stations in both the New Jersey- and New York-side ventilation buildings, which were built above the tunnel to act as exhausts while pumping fresh air in. These stations combine with antennae outside both ends to split the 8,000 feet into 2,000-foot sections \u2014Â a length that makes the signal loss much more manageable.\nWhy not just use regular antennae throughout the tunnel? The immediate reason was space \u2014 AT&T was told that if they installed antennae along the walls of each of the three tunnels, they would likely be knocked off by the machines the Port Authority uses to clean the tunnel's walls. The long-term reason, though, was it would have forced a massive upkeep effort.\nThere's not enough room for regular antennas\n\"If we had put separate antennae in, we would have had to keep upgrading. But the leaky coax allows you to use any technology over it,\" said  Carl Busseno.   \"Now as we upgrade the network it\u2019s all done in the base station. The leaky coax stays the same.\" In other words, the 20-year-old plan idea has easily scaled over the years, and the same infrastructure that once supported the earliest cell phones can now support 3G, 4G, and soon enough, LTE signals.\nWhile this technology has quietly benefitted travelers and tri-state residents for two decades, it also has near-future implications \u2014 it\u2019s likely going to be one of the ways that cellular service makes it into New York City\u2019s subway system. According to Busseno, the plan is to use antennae along the straighter sections of the subway, essentially blasting the signals from platform to platform until they overlap enough to cover the whole tunnel. But that solution is too unidirectional to cover the ones that curve; that's where leaky coax comes into play.\nThere are lots of things in New York City that leak; most are bad. This is the rare exception.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe leaky coax runs 8,000 linear feet along the length of each of the Lincoln Tunnel's tubes.\nThe top cable is where the leaky coax technology lives, fastened every few feet along the 8,000-foot tube.\nPort Authority CTO Robert Galvin holds up a Motorola MicroTac 650, one of the popular cell phones at the time the technology was installed. The same infrastructure that allowed this phone to make and receive calls in the tunnel works with today's technolo\nThe New Jersey Lincoln Tunnel vent building is where AT&T and the other companies' base stations are housed, which send (and repeat) the signal through the tunnel.\nSince AT&T helped build out the technology in the first place, the company has its own room in which it houses all of the base station equipment.\nAT&T's Director of Radio Technology Carl Busseno explains how the company gets the signal to and from the base station room.\nInside the base station room is one twenty-year-old logbook, where all of the activity from the past two decades has been recorded.\nThe logbook contains entries for things like Ericsson employees visiting, tables being delivered, and details about upgrades to the overall system.\nOther cell companies have had to find space in the top floor of the ventilation building for their base stations.\nThe cell companies' base stations are located in Lincoln Tunnel vent buildings on both sides of the river, which are home to dozens of chalk-drawn diagrams and charts that the Port Authority workers use as reference.\nBusseno points out the the section of the room where all the upgrades to the entire system have been made.\n","Title":"This is how you make phones work 100 feet underground | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","us-world","tech"]}
