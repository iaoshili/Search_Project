{"Main text":"Minecon is coming back in 2015\nAnnual Minecraft convention will take place in London this July\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMinecon is back. The annual celebration of all things Minecraft will return in 2015, after going on hiatus last year. This year's convention will be taking place in London this July, and developer Mojang expects around 10,000 attendees. That's a good deal larger than the last Minecon, in which 7,500 people turned up in Orlando in 2013. Tickets will go on sale sometime this month, and they'll likely go fast: the 2012 Minecon sold out in just two hours.\nDespite last year's hiatus, the return of Minecon shouldn't be too much of a surprise, as the game remains hugely popular even though it was released in 2009. Of course, Minecraft has also changed quite a bit since the last event in Orlando \u2014 there's everything from  a feature film in the works to an upcoming  story-based adventure game from the studio behind The Walking Dead . It's become a cultural touchstone  referenced by late night talk shows and  Lego . Oh, and  Microsoft purchased the game and its studio for $2.5 billion , and could potentially  turn Minecraft into a killer app for its new holographic goggles .\nMinecon 2015 will be taking place on July 4th and 5th at the ExCeL London Exhibition and Conference Centre.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
