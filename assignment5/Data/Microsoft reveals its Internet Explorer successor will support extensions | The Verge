{"Main text":"Microsoft reveals its Internet Explorer successor will support extensions\nMore features are coming to Spartan\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is planning to support extensions in the successor to its Internet Explorer browser. Currently codenamed Spartan, the new browser will be included as part of Windows 10 across PCs, phones, and tablets. Spartan\u2019s extension support isn\u2019t clear, but Microsoft\u2019s browser development team  confirmed the feature on Twitter by noting that \"we're working on a plan for extensions for a future update to Project Spartan.\"\nSpartan's extensions could look a lot like Chrome's\nInternet Explorer 11  currently supports add-ons , but they\u2019re not similar to the popular extensions found in Chrome and Firefox. The Verge understands Microsoft is currently testing ways to allow Chrome extension developers to easily port their work across to Spartan. While the extension support might not be identical to that of Chrome, the results could be close. Internet Explorer has lacked fully functional extensions for years now, and Microsoft has relied on its ageing ActiveX technology to extend the functionality of its browser.\nThe new extensions support is likely linked to Microsoft\u2019s plans to separate out Spartan from Internet Explorer. While some versions of Windows 10 will ship with Internet Explorer and Spartan for compatibility reasons, the new Spartan browser will use a new  rendering engine named Edge . It\u2019s similar to Microsoft\u2019s existing Trident engine that powers Internet Explorer 11, but it\u2019s clear the company is moving away from having to support legacy document modes. We\u2019re still waiting to hear a lot more about Spartan, but Microsoft did reveal that the new browser also includes an inking mode to annotate web pages, Cortana digital assistant integration, and reading mode features. Microsoft will ship Spartan as part of Windows 10, but the company has not yet revealed whether it will also become available to Windows 7 or Windows 8 users.\n","Title":"Microsoft reveals its Internet Explorer successor will support extensions | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
