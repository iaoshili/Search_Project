{"Main text":"Controversial 'Los Angeles Plays Itself' documentary is finally coming home\nOnly a city with an inferiority complex would allow itself to be reduced to an acronym\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThom Anderson's 169-minute documentary about the City of Angels' complicated relationship with Hollywood is finally coming to digital platforms, according to IndieWire. Film distributor Cinema Guild announced its acquisition of Los Angeles Plays Itself yesterday on Twitter. Anderson's seminal treatise on Hollywood's favorite playground was never widely distributed in spite of positive reviews, which many suspect is due to its comprehensive use of footage from other films. But, that didn't stop the public from falling in love with Anderson's incisive criticism and call to better represent Los Angeles in its entirety. Indiewire writes that while an exact date has yet to be revealed, Cinema Guild expects the film to be released on DVD and video on demand systems in the fall.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
