{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMore than almost anyone, Grant Morrison has plumbed the weirdness that lies at the heart of comics. Since the 1980s, he\u2019s helped redefine the superhero genre, producing surreal, fourth-wall-breaking titles like Animal Man and Doom Patrol, as well as popular iterations of Batman and Superman and the DC Universe-wide Final Crisis storyline. The Invisibles, one of his best-known works, slowly unfurled from a straightforward story about a team of countercultural rebels into a mind-bending deconstruction of reality itself. His nonfiction book Supergods analyzed superheroes as mythological archetypes that we create and rework to express the basic elements of being human.\nMorrison\u2019s career is too long to neatly summarize, but one of its central themes is the highly permeable boundary between fiction and reality. His upcoming six-issue series, Annihilator, is no exception. Drawn by artist Frazer Irving, it\u2019s about a screenwriter named Ray Spass struggling to write a sci-fi blockbuster about a rebel named Max Nomax, who has been exiled to the penumbra of a black hole for committing \u201Cthe ultimate crime.\u201D Soon, he\u2019s writing not for a studio but for Nomax himself, who is simultaneously a fictional character, the ur-template for Byronic antiheroes throughout history, and a real man who gives Ray seven days to write him a past.\nDevil deals and black-hole prisons notwithstanding, Annihilator doesn\u2019t have the otherworldly trippiness of some of Morrison\u2019s best-known work. In some places, it\u2019s a take that to Hollywood banality; in others, it\u2019s an attempt to distill fictional characters down to their most basic essence. With the first issue out tomorrow, we talked to Morrison about myth-making, originality, and the dark undercurrents of modern fiction.\nInterview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nAnnihilator feels less packed with surreality than some of the things that I remember you for. It seems more traditionally designed and plotted.\nYou\u2019re absolutely right. It was deliberately designed to seem more like a Hollywood thing, and that\u2019s why it was the perfect project for Legendary, who are a Hollywood movie studio. So when they came to me and we talked about doing comics with Bob Schreck and Thomas Tull, this was the idea I thought was most appropriate for Legendary, because it was about filmmaking, it was about Hollywood, it was about the movies. So yeah, I mean, it\u2019s a lot more real than some of the stuff that I write. But also it, as you\u2019ll see, it goes into pretty bizarre areas. But I find that the mundane and the fantastic are pretty closely linked anyway, so I kind of enjoy doing both.\n\"It\u2019s a town of people selling their souls for fame or success or money.\"\nRay Spass reminds me a little of the Stephen King prototype, the down-and-out writer.\nThe thing about Ray is that he\u2019s not entirely down and out, he obviously has a little bit of money because he buys quite a nice house at the beginning of the book. But I think morally he\u2019s down and out, and creatively he\u2019s down and out. But he was based very much on a bunch of different people that I actually met in Los Angeles and found quite fascinating. People who\u2019d live and work in Los Angeles on a pretty regular basis. So I was kind of basing it on my observations of people in the town.\nYou\u2019ve talked about how Annihilator is sort of all about Los Angeles.\nAbsolutely. As I\u2019ve said, obviously you start to cover similar ground, but I find the place fascinating. I\u2019ve got a house there, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there and I have a lot of friends there, and while there\u2019s a certain softness and glamor and glitter to Los Angeles, I think what\u2019s really interesting is what\u2019s underneath. It\u2019s a very dark place, and it has connections to this strange occult stuff, the whole Church of Satan and Anton LaVey, which I\u2019ve mentioned before, or the Jack Parsons Jet Lab connection, or the Manson family, of the Doors and the Snake and the underground caverns that they used to talk about. And I think it\u2019s got a very strange undercurrent that I find quite fascinating, because it\u2019s completely at odds with the way most people think of Hollywood, probably.\nAnd it\u2019s a town of devil deals, it\u2019s a town of people selling their souls for fame or success or money, so I think it\u2019s got a very strange atmosphere. I tried to capture that, with Frazer [Irvine\u2019s] help, in Annihilator.\nIt\u2019s an incredibly dark comic.\nAt the same time, hopefully what we tried to do with it was make it funny, because I think if you\u2019re trying to confront the dark in that sense, I think it has to at least be leavened with humanity\u2019s great gift, which is a sense of humor. So hopefully it\u2019ll at least give you a few laughs as well.\nThere were a couple of bits that were really fantastic. I loved the \"cure for death\" page, because it totally captured something being fantastic and then going to the next page and saying, \"Wow, that\u2019s also really overwrought and dramatic. But still great.\"\nThat was like, the period at the end of that sentence, which sounded so full of bravado, and then you turn the page and have the sense of everything as a vast, black hole that doesn\u2019t go away.\nHow do you approach creating an archetype like Max Nomax, compared to just using an actual existing character? You\u2019re reinterpreting both, but how do you deal with them differently?\nI was trying to do Ray Spass as a contemporary screenwriter who\u2019s working in Hollywood right now,\nand right now, Hollywood, as you know, is pretty obsessed with superheroic characters or, as you see, pretty archetypal characters. It\u2019s easy to understand what Batman represents, for instance. So I was, I wanted to show that he was doing that kind of movie, that he was trying to create a hero for the 21st century, in these fraught and fretful times we live in.\nSo then I got to thinking about characters like Batman, and Hamlet, and that kind of high-cheekboned, Byronic, antihero character that\u2019s kind of haunted all of our literature and so many of our movies and books and TV shows, and it was really just about going back. Because ultimately I thought that all tracks back to Milton\u2019s Satan to be honest. So I kind of was telling a story about a devil, through the medium of science fiction. And I think the character came to me through these different angles, and then I thought about the different portrayals of that character in popular culture, so we connected them to Fantomas, you know, the early 20th-century surrealist hero who was kind of a pulp fiction character, or to characters like Diabolik from the 1970s Italian comic books, or Criminale, who was another, a character who dressed in a skull suit and went around robbing people and shooting things.\nThey were very dark antiheroes, and I was kind of trying to track the lineage of those guys right back to the original, and build up Nomax from basically Milton\u2019s Satan via lots of these other portrayals of the ultimate rebel antihero poet dissident character that we\u2019ve been haunted by.\nWhat\u2019s the difference to you between something like this, an archetype of something classic, and just a cliche?\nWho knows? I think it just depends on how you deploy them. Perhaps it can easily shift into cliché \u2014 I mean, as long as I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a cliché, then I\u2019m fine with it. But I think if other people start to see that, then yeah, obviously it becomes embarrassing. So hopefully Nomax won\u2019t be a cliché. We\u2019ve tried to give him a personality that\u2019s pretty strong and pretty direct, and again quite funny; he\u2019s got a certain take on things. So I think the only way to do it is to be aware of its origins, and kind of the ubiquity of these figures, but at the same time give them enough personality that\u2026 Max Nomax is very different from the other iterations of the dark man I\u2019ve mentioned, so hopefully he has his own personality as well.\nThe female characters that I\u2019ve seen so far tend to be love interests and prostitutes. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to change?\nIt\u2019s actually about that; there\u2019s a character who comes in in Issue 3 who\u2019s really central to the entire thing, and it\u2019s kind of about the attitude of men to women in Hollywood. Again it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll see unfold, but actually part of the story is about the way men treat women. About how the screen treats women.\nHow do you do that without just replicating it? How do you depict that without it just being another part of Hollywood \u2014 talking about how men treat women but just treating them the same way?\nBy making the character strong, and by giving her things to do, which aren\u2019t necessarily the traditional things that happen in stories like these. And that\u2019s honestly what it\u2019s all about, as you\u2019ll see, I think. The female character who enters this story is very important to how it plays out.\nDo you think these themes and myths are all something that are already set, and we\u2019re just going back to a monomyth? Or are we still developing new archetypes, and new myths, and new ideas?\nI honestly.. from having observed it, I think we keep going back to what are basically six human default personalities. We have these different characters: there\u2019s the comedian, there\u2019s the lover, there\u2019s the stern judge, there\u2019s the critic\u2026 I think people have always developed gods and ideas like that around these basic default states of the actual human personality. I think it\u2019s just part of how we\u2019re made up. It\u2019s almost like the periodic table of being human. And I think no matter how modern these characters look, I\u2019m not entirely convinced\u2026\nI think certain things like the atom bomb created a new archetype, and we saw how that appeared in fiction, and in pop culture. So yeah, there\u2019s probably the potential for new technologies and new ideas to create their own archetypes, but I honestly think the human personality hasn\u2019t changed much over our entire span of time. I know I live in the 21st century, so I have no idea what people felt like in the 1300s!\nBut that\u2019s kind of my take on it, right or wrong, I kind of think we do go back to the same well often, because I think these are the characteristics we recognize in ourselves and others as being kind of universal.\nAre there types that you wish you\u2019d been able to write so far that you haven\u2019t? Or that you\u2019re interested in?\nI guess as a writer you\u2019re often drawn to characters like Nomax the rebel, because a lot of writers like to self-imagine themselves as rebels against society when in fact most of the time we\u2019re just part of society. I\u2019ve kind of tried to write about characters that I felt at least some connection with, but I think through my life I\u2019ve always written about people who are slightly at right angles to society, and maybe that\u2019s just... maybe I need to write more about kings and queens and dukes.\nYou were talking about Annihilator and darkness and this being a place that we are culturally right now. Do you think there\u2019s something that follows that, something that we\u2019re going to be moving into?\n\"We seem to be very enamored by darkness.\"\nIt\u2019s hard to say, because we seem to be very enamored by darkness. Things just keep coming out like True Detective, which came out earlier in the year and was really talking about darkness and nihilism, and that obviously was inspired by a lot of the same books I read when I was working on Annihilator. But that was a great show and it really seemed timely and important and modern. I think whether it\u2019s created by the media \u2014 because really as we know, most people are living better lives now than they have at any time in history, most people are safer, especially in the Western world, the child mortality rate has gone down, the chance of dying has lessened \u2014 so we actually live in a much better world, but our entertainment seems really very interested in the dark areas of experience. It goes all the way from the zombies to the obsession with war and violence that we have. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because we\u2019re so comfortable we can afford to play with these things, or if there is just something wrong with humanity.\nBesides True Detective, what are you looking at right now in terms of contemporary artists, authors, etc.?\nNot an awful lot of stuff. I tend to just lock myself away and work. But again a lot of stuff kind of relates to what I\u2019m doing. I picked up a book quite recently called Luminarium by Alex Shakar, an author, and it just seemed to be talking about the same stuff that I\u2019m talking about in Annihilator. It\u2019s all about the abyss at the center of our lives that we try to forget about and we make stories about and we orbit around. So I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019ve been reading a lot of that, and then nihilism, like Raymond Brassier, the nihilist philosopher, and Thomas Ligotti, because I really wanted to get down into the dark areas of human experience.\nIf it doesn\u2019t sound too grandiose, what kind of stuff do you think people are going to be mining your work for, and everybody else\u2019s work for, in 40 years? The way that we\u2019re looking back at things from the mid-20th century and reinterpreting them?\nI don\u2019t know. I think honestly it will just be more Batman. I think a lot of us will be forgotten in 40 years. I really don\u2019t expect \u2014 my work is talking about the world I\u2019m in, with the people that I live in the world with right now, so I never think about the future. I honestly think I\u2019ll be forgotten in two generations, and what will be there is Sherlock Holmes and all the stuff that we\u2019re kind of fascinated with, unless people break out of their nervous fear of the future and start to innovate again. Right now it seems like everybody\u2019d kind of rather look backwards than forwards, because forwards seems a bit scary.\n","Title":"Into the black hole: an interview with comics author Grant Morrison | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment"]}
