These are the moments that lead sensible people to just say fuck it, pick up their Red Vines and soda, and head for the nearest exit. Life\u2019s too short, they say. If I really want to finish this, it\u2019ll be on Netflix, they say. I didn\u2019t spend $20 and drive here to make my life demonstrably worse, they say.\nIf only I could have done that same thing during Jupiter Ascending.\nPerhaps I should have been better prepared for the latest film from the Wachowskis, which opens today. Jupiter Ascending has been troubled for some time; the initial trailers didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence, and that was before the movie\u2019s release got moved from last summer to the dumping ground of February. And while The Matrix was a watershed moment in both visual effects and mainstream sci-fi that continues to engender goodwill, it was also 16 years ago. Since then, the filmmaking duo have proven their ability to create brilliant, kaleidoscopic visuals (Speed Racer) and ambitious, if overwrought, narratives (Cloud Atlas), but none of their movies have coalesced into a cohesive whole. Jupiter Ascending is somehow the worst of both worlds.\nMila Kunis plays Jupiter Jones, a young woman who cleans toilets for a living. When a pointy-eared Channing Tatum shows up (he\u2019s Caine Wise, a genetically engineered, speed skating wolf \/ human hybrid), Jupiter discovers that she\u2019s actually the genetic reincarnation of the queen of the universe. As such, she\u2019s in line to receive some of the queen\u2019s assets \u2014 which include Earth itself \u2014 but some of the royal children want to stop that from happening.\nThat already sounds pretty damn convoluted, and that\u2019s only the logline. Add to that competing family members, a corporation that the queen\u2019s family runs, the socio-political dynamics of the interstellar world itself, as well as layers of backstory on how the human race was seeded by intergalactic visitors. Jupiter Ascending is a shambling, rambling mess, and while it\u2019s certainly a welcome change any time an original work of science fiction is produced, when the net result is this convoluted, it\u2019s all too easy to see why studios are far more comfortable with adapting known material.\nFor every narrative weakness, however, Jupiter Ascending soars as a visual accomplishment. It\u2019s outrageously gorgeous, full of life and color and intricately designed spectacle. None of it may be particularly original, but it\u2019s a wonderful screensaver of a movie. The Wachowskis take full advantage of 3D \u2014 one imagines what Speed Racer could have done with the format \u2014 embracing its strengths and weaknesses to create a moving graphic novel full of sharply defined, exaggerated layers. If you fondly remember the ViewMaster, Jupiter Ascending will feel all too familiar: this is pure sci-fi fantasy, not worried about remaining grounded or realistic in the slightest.\nA wonderful screensaver of a movie\nThe outrageous, opulent design had me thinking quite a bit about Alejandro Jodorowsky, actually. Last year the wonderful documentaryÂ  Jodorowsky\u2019s Dune detailed the filmmaker\u2019s failed attempt to bring the novel Dune to the big screen in the 1970s. He assembled a group of incredibly talented artists and visualists to articulate his vision, and while the movie itself was never made, many of those design fragments seeped out into the world, seeding films like Alien and Star Wars. The unspoken truth at the heart of the documentary, however, was that Jodorowsky\u2019s vision for Dune was genuinely batshit crazy, and even if it had been made we would have gotten a visually stunning film that made zero sense.\nThat\u2019s Jupiter Ascending. And it\u2019s not just a matter of too many ingredients being thrown into the pot either; there are some basic character and story issues that make the film an inherently passive experience. That all begins with Jupiter; while she\u2019s ostensibly the hero of the story, she takes almost no action on her own. The entire film is her being whisked to one location, where she receives a piece of exposition, then being flown to another location, where somebody needs to step in and rescue her. Which is then followed by\u2026 well, you get the idea.\nIt\u2019s so exaggerated I started to wonder if it wasn\u2019t some sort of intentional choice or meta-commentary. One sequence in the film \u2014 a truly fun play on Brazil, complete with Terry Gilliam cameo \u2014 follows Jupiter as she\u2019s bounced around what feels like the intergalactic DMV, desperately trying to get her genetic queenhood authenticated. The entire time she\u2019s accompanied by a robotic companion that does all the talking for her, and that\u2019s what Jupiter Ascending itself feels like: an exhausting trial that you never want to experience again.\nAn exhausting cinematic trial\nDespite those problems, or perhaps because of them, I\u2019m still rooting for the Wachowskis \u2014 and their Netflix show Sense8 in particular. Ever since The Matrix Reloaded stepped outside the comfy confines of the hero\u2019s journey archetype, their films have seemed bloated and slightly lost. Not like they\u2019d forgotten how to tell stories, by any means, but that the tales they wanted to tell were poorly matched for the pacing and confines of a generally two-hour medium. Stretching out over 10 hours a season could be the exact right match, letting the incredibly talented filmmakers rethink television sci-fi much like they did with movies in 1999.\nIt\u2019s certainly got to be better than Jupiter Ascending.\n","Title":"Jupiter Ascending: it\u2019s time for an intervention | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
