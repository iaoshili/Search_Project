{"Main text":"The first Batman v. Superman trailer has been officially released\nHeavy metal Batman takes on the Man of Steel\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor those who absolutely, positively cannot wait to see the Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice trailer  set to debut at IMAX theaters on Monday , the official trailer has been released some hours after a low-quality version leaked online. This teaser trailer starts to illuminate the grounds for conflict between two of the world's favorite superheroes. Superman's boundless powers have apparently earned him the public's distrust, and Batman is playing his usual public protector role in taking on the man from Krypton. It's all set to a menacing, pounding soundtrack, and culminates in a badass quip from Batman, wearing a thick new suit of heavy metal armor. \"Tell me, do you bleed?\" enquires the Dark Knight, before following up with the words, \"You will.\"\nThe theme of the trailer and very likely the movie as a whole can be summed with some help from  Kanye + Comics :\n★★★\nUpdate April 17th, 6:49PM: Director Zack Snyder has posted a legitimate version of the trailer on Twitter , which is still packed with the aforementioned badass Batman quip. It can be now seen above instead of the original blurry camera footage.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
