{"Main text":"Artists made a Simpsons video that's better than most new Simpsons  episodes\nMy son's name is Bort\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike The Simpsons itself, this new video defies trend.\nThe \"pop culture touchstone reimagined as pixel art\" video has been played out for years \u2014 even  MTV plans to move on to the  Cory Arcangel HTML-grunge aesthetic \u2014 but this fan-made Simpsons intro, crafted in pastel pixel art, feels as fresh and strange as a three-eyed fish.\nOf course, it has credentials: it was created by pixel-masters  Paul Robertson (the Scott Pilgrim video game) and Ivan Dixon (Rubber House), and set to music by  Jeremy Dower . The producers of The Simpsons have partnered with a number of acclaimed artists in recent years, including  Banksy and Don Hertzfeldt . Perhaps the video will get the official Simpsons treatment in the coming seasons.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
