{"Main text":"The best reason to own a new PC is to play five-year-old games\nSometimes the past looks like the future\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLike wines, fiber supplements, and cast iron pans, some video games get better with age.\nI recently upgraded my PC. It\u2019s an expensive and irritating process, so I wanted to justify the money and time. Recent graphic showcases were boring and buggy and instilled an irksome sensation that I\u2019d made a mistake. On a whim, I downloaded a handful of my favorite games from the previous generation. I buried my PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in the back of our apartment\u2019s coat closet in 2013 and have missed my semi-regular dip into my comfort games. In an hour, I had BioShock, Far Cry 2, Bulletstorm, and a handful of other games from before 2010 ready to play.\nFor the past month, I\u2019ve almost exclusively played games from 2008 and 2009. January\u2019s a notoriously slow time for video game releases. I figured my diversion into the recent past would be just that, and by now, early February, these half-dozen oldies would be deleted from my hard drive to make room for the gargantuan storage space required by some fresh blockbusters, like Evolve or the Battlefield Hardline beta. But as new games approach, I find myself uninterested.\nI figured old games were a temporary distraction\nNone of these half-decade-old games look their age. I had upgraded my PC for flashy graphic showcases, but what it does best is improve upon my back catalog. Thanks to my new graphics card and the option on my PC to use that graphic horsepower to improve the superficials of older games, most of the blemishes I remember \u2014 the jaggy edges and the low resolution, which made games look both sharp and blurry at the same time \u2014 have been removed, polished, or beautified.\nBecause older games don\u2019t demand the entirety of my computer\u2019s power, the remainder of my graphics card can be used to run my adventures in 4k then downsample them to my 1080p television. There are all sorts of additional graphic tweaks, jargon that only a graphics card nut will appreciate, so out of mercy I will instead say that with a few clicks, I can make something old look like something new.\nNext\nA five-year-old video game doesn\u2019t look as visually robust as a game made today; even the most powerful computer can\u2019t add new features, like blood pulsing beneath a character\u2019s skin, realistic hair, or embers that raise from digital fires where they never previously existed. But the curious and exciting thing is that their minimal style has a clearer, refined aesthetic. Because games had to be designed around limits, every object feels intentionally chosen and placed.\nGraphic horsepower benefits simplistic style\nMy grandfather-in-law once described his experience on pot, saying, \"The browns are browner and the greens are greener.\" Looking back on these games, I relate. I, too, feel a little high. The lines are sharper, the image is clearer, everything runs better.\nIf you play new video games, you know they can sometimes be a little too new, as if they need a few more months in the incubator. Video game developers have used patches, files that can be installed after a game\u2019s release, to fix errors and squash bugs. Some games take months to patch, others \u2014 that rare game that\u2019s both beloved and substantially broken \u2014 can see patches for years. But five years in, it\u2019s safe to say changes that need to be made either have been made or never will be made.\nI like these games in particular because their release window, 2007-2009, felt like an audacious time for video games. Just Cause 2 is like Grand Theft Auto on a Jerry Bruckheimer scale. Far Cry 2 inspired its more popular sequels, but it\u2019s an aggressively violent and difficult game about the exhaustion of the diamond trade in a \"Central African State.\" And somehow the creators of Red Faction: Guerrilla made an entire game about being a terrorist that uses the destruction of buildings as his tool for social reformation.\nWeirdness wasn't entirely cost-prohibitive\nI\u2019m aware there\u2019s tremendous innovation happening in the video game industry, particularly in the indie space. And I\u2019m also aware that blockbusters are grander and more spectacular than ever before. But this period at the end of the '00s felt like the final days of the mid-budget game, where creative risk wasn\u2019t totally cost-prohibitive.\nOld games are coming back strong. In the past month, we\u2019ve seen polished re-releases of  Resident Evil, Grim Fandango, and Indigo Prophecy receive critical attention and, judging purely from Steam\u2019s top sales spots, some financial success. This month Nintendo will launch its New 3DS XL on the back of The Legend of Zelda: Majora\u2019s Mask , an update of the N64 cult favorite. And  Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime Trilogy , two of my favorite Wii games, are now available on the Wii U .\nVideo game lovers are a notoriously nostalgic bunch, but I look at these games in particular, and I see a thirst for the strange and reliable. Many of these games are parts of storied franchises, but they\u2019re the oddballs. And now, on superior hardware, these oddballs look splendid and work just as well.\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get around to the new stuff. But I\u2019m content for now with simple, strange, graphically minimal games that I count on working as intended. For kicks I made a list of the upcoming games I want to play: Darkest Dungeon, Apotheon, and Grow Home. They\u2019re strange, they\u2019re bold, and they should run just fine on my PC. If they\u2019re really good, I bet they\u2019ll get better with age.\nImages via these two NeoGAF threads that will swallow your time if you let them.\n","Title":"The best reason to own a new PC is to play five-year-old games | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment","essay"]}
