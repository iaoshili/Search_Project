{"Main text":"Sling TV now available in the US, and it's adding AMC to the channel lineup\nSuddenly Dish's internet TV service is about way more than ESPN\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWorry about invites no more: as of today,  Dish's Sling TV service is now available to all consumers in the United States. You can sign up for a week-long trial to decide if internet TV is worth the $20. But there's better news: the company has announced that will be adding AMC to the core channel lineup. That's pretty huge and fills what was originally a glaring hole in Sling's programming; you'll now be able to watch The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, and Mad Men along with your friends and family who are paying way more for cable. Dish notes that its AMC Networks deal also includes BBC America, BBC World News, IFC, Sundance TV, and We TV, but those channels will be coming sometime later. AMC itself will be available \"soon.\" For Sling customers, hopefully that means very soon.\nAt launch, you can watch Sling TV on the web (via Mac or PC), iOS, Android, Roku players, and Roku TV. Support for Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Xbox One, the Nexus Player, and other devices will be coming in the future. At launch, here's the full channel lineup:\nCore package ($20\/mo):\nESPN, ESPN2, AMC (coming soon), TNT, TBS, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, ABC Family, Disney Channel, CNN, El Rey, Galavision, Maker Network\nNews and Information Extra ($5\/mo):\nBloomberg, HLN, DIY, Cooking Channel\nKids Extra ($5\/mo):\nDisney Junior, Disney XD, Boomerang, Baby TV, Duck TV\nSports Extra ($5\/mo):\nESPN News, ESPN U, SEC ESPN Network, ESPN Buzzer Beater, ESPN Bases Loaded, ESPN Goal Line.
