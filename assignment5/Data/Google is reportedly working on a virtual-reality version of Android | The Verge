{"Main text":"Google is reportedly working on a virtual-reality version of Android\nAndroid is coming after Oculus Rift, The Wall Street Journal reports\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAndroid is moving from mobile devices to virtual-reality headsets, according to a new report. The Wall Street Journal, citing two unnamed sources, reported Friday that  Google has tasked a group of engineers with developing a version of Android to power VR applications. \"Tens of engineers\" are working on the project, according to the Journal, which will be freely distributed like its cousins for smartphones, tablets, and wearables.\nGoogle declined to comment on the report, which included few details about how Android VR will look or when it might become available. The move comes in the wake of Facebook's $2 billion purchase of Oculus and Oculus' subsequent move to develop new forms of storytelling powered by VR. VR dominated this week's  Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where  a new headset from Valve and  progress on Sony's Project Morpheus were among the biggest developments.\nThe Journal reports that Android VR is being led by Clay Bavor and Jeremy Doig. Bavor is partly responsible for  Google Cardboard , a low-cost, do-it-yourself alternative to expensive headsets that turns your smartphone into a viewer. The Cardboard app has been downloaded more than 1 million times since it became available last summer.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
