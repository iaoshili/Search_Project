(Former GM CEO Rick Wagoner himself rolled onto stage in a Volt at a CES keynote in 2008.) The production first-generation Volt was met with mixed reviews \u2014 it can only go a few dozen miles on electric before switching to gas, has finicky electronics, and doesn't look nearly as good as the concept did \u2014 but still represents a huge, ongoing bet for GM on the future of gas and electric. Since the Volt's launch, an additional vehicle \u2014  Cadillac's ELR \u2014 has adopted the so-called Voltec drivetrain.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nJust a fleeting glimpse\nGM was serious about revealing the car in earnest at the Detroit show next week: the Volt was shown on stage for mere moments, before being concealed again by a white cylinder of cloth. It doesn't look like we'll be seeing it again at CES \u2014 for this show, it's all about GM's connected car announcements.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"This is the 2016 Chevrolet Volt | The Verge","Tags":["breaking","transportation","ces-2015"]}
