{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis weekend\u2019s big movie is the sequel \/ prequel X-Men: Days of Future Past . It\u2019ll be slugging it out with Godzilla , but if you\u2019re looking for something a little less flashy, there are plenty of movies on the horizon that involve neither lizards, mutants, or angsty men with metal claws and high-maintenance hair. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nKingsman: The Secret Service\nThe last time he stepped behind the camera, director Matthew Vaughn breathed new life into an ailing franchise with X-Men: First Class. His new film is another comic book adaptation, and judging from this trailer combines frenetic action with Colin Firth\u2019s awkward cool in the perfect manner.\nLife Itself\nThe world of film, and culture in general, lost a vital voice last year when critic Roger Ebert died at the age of 70. This documentary from Steve James (Hoop Dreams) has been moving audiences since it first started screening at festivals, and was one of ourÂ  favorite movies at Sundance this year . It will be available in theaters and on iTunes on July 4th.\nMagic in the Moonlight\nAlong with Kingsman, Colin Firth also appears in Woody Allen\u2019s latest, where he plays a man tasked with proving that a self-proclaimed medium (Emma Stone) is a fake. Romance, wordplay, and comic absurdities ensue.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Kingsman: The Secret Service,' 'Life Itself,' and 'Magic in the Moonlight' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
