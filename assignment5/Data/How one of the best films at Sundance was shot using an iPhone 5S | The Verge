{"Main text":"How one of the best films at Sundance was shot using an iPhone 5S\nA breakout hit made with an $8 app\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTangerine , a breakout hit from this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, is full of surprises. There\u2019s the subject matter: transgender prostitutes working in a not-so glamorous part of Hollywood. And there are the characters: flinty, funny, nobody\u2019s victim. But the story behind the camera is as surprising as what\u2019s in front of it. Particularly because the camera used to shoot Tangerine was the iPhone 5S.\n\"It was surprisingly easy.\"\nPlenty of amateur films have been shot using iPhones, but by all reports, this is the first movie at the Sundance Film Festival to be shot almost entirely on an Apple device. It was a decision that indie writer and director Sean Baker made to accommodate the film\u2019s small budget. But you\u2019d never guess the camera, to look at it: Tangerine was shot in a widescreen, 2:35:1 aspect ratio, and its camera zooms through the streets of LA with a fluidity you\u2019d never expect from a handheld device. And yet despite his camera of choice, Baker says the iPhone made for a good partner. \"It was surprisingly easy,\" Baker says. \"We never lost any footage.\"\nSo how do you make a Sundance movie for iPhone? You need four things. First, of course, the iPhone (Baker and his team used three). Second, an $8 app called  Filmic Pro that allowed the filmmakers fine-grained control over the focus, aperture, and color temperature. Third, a Steadicam. \"These phones, because they\u2019re so light, and they\u2019re so small, a human hand \u2014 no matter how stable you are \u2014 it will shake. And it won\u2019t look good,\" says Baker. \"So you needed the Steadicam rig to stabilize it.\"\nThe final ingredient was a set of anamorphic adapter lenses that attach to the iPhone. The lenses were prototypes from Moondog Labs , and Baker said they were essential to making Tangerine look like it belonged on a big screen. \"To tell you the truth, I wouldn\u2019t have even made the movie without it,\" Baker says. \"It truly elevated it to a cinematic level.\"\n\"Jesus Christ, man, I was on The Wire.\"\nLike any conventional film, Tangerine underwent post-production. \"With a lot of these social realist films, the first thing you do is drain the color,\" Baker says. \"We went the other way. We pumped the colors and put the saturation through the roof. Just because the world there is so colorful, and the women are so colorful. We wanted it to match them.\" (Orange emerged as the dominant color in the film, inspiring its title.) The final step was to apply a digital grain to the movie, giving it a quality more reminiscent of actual film.\nAt first, the cast wasn\u2019t convinced shooting with the iPhone would work. \"I had some hesitancy about it, more out of pride,\" says James Ransone, who plays Chester, the pimp at the center of Tangerine\u2019s love triangle. \"I\u2019m like, Jesus Christ, man, I was on The Wire . I\u2019ve ended up in iPhone movies!\" But Ransone came to appreciate the flexibility of the device. \"There\u2019s a lot that can be done with an iPhone.\" (One example: Baker shot several scenes while riding his 10-speed bicycle in circles around his actors.)\nRansone said that the key to shooting Tangerine was having a team well-versed in traditional filmmaking. \"You still need to know how editing works. You still need to know how sound works. You still need to know how a camera works,\" he says. \"You can\u2019t just go out and shoot.\" iPhone footage hasn\u2019t yet caught up with true 35 millimeter film \u2014 a high bar \u2014 but Ransone expects it will some day. \"Yes, you can make a beautiful-looking film on a shoestring budget,\" he says. \"But you have to know 100 years worth of filmmaking.\"\n\"You can make a beautiful film on a shoestring budget.\"\nThe unusual creative process behind Tangerine doesn\u2019t stop with its camera. Baker made the movie after becoming obsessed with a donut store in his neighborhood, a seedy block on Santa Monica Boulevard with a notorious reputation. \"It was a chaotic corner \u2014 there was always something going on in Donut Time,\" he says. \"So I said, I wanna make a film about Donut Time.\" That idea led him and his co-writer, Chris Bergoch, to a nearby LGBT center, where they met Mya Taylor, an aspiring singer and actress, who in turn introduced the filmmakers to her roommate and eventual co-star, Kiki Kitana Rodriguez.\nThe two women began sharing some stories from around the block, (\"People love to hear drama. Especially filmmakers,\" Taylor tells me) and happened upon a striking bit of drama from the neighborhood: a trans woman became enraged when she heard her boyfriend had slept with a biological female \u2014 \"actual fish,\" as they say in Tangerine. The trans woman decided to hunt the other woman down, and thus Tangerine found its inspiration, with the writers collaborating with their cast on the script.\nThe result, at least for me, is the ideal Sundance movie: totally unexpected, set in a world I\u2019ve never visited, with a story the major studios wouldn\u2019t touch with a 10-foot selfie stick. Rodriguez is an effervescent blur as Sin-Dee Rella, an ex-con hunting down her pimp fiancée\u2019s mistress on Christmas Eve. She stomps down Hollywood\u2019s Walk of Fame like it\u2019s a catwalk, spitting fire at anyone dumb enough to cross her, and manages to terrify nearly every man she meets. Taylor, as her best friend and fellow prostitute Alexandra, tries to talk sense into Sin-Dee every step of the way, cleaning up the damage in her wake. Their sisterhood in the face of real danger brings depth to the frequently over-the-top comedy.\nTangerine isn\u2019t perfect \u2014 it slows considerably in its final third, and the big climax at Donut Time feels less convincing than the film that led up to it. But in a festival full of coming-of-age dramas and straightforward documentaries, it\u2019s a minor miracle: a good long look at the margins, captured by a $550 phone.\n","Title":"How one of the best films at Sundance was shot using an iPhone 5S | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","report","entertainment","tech"]}
