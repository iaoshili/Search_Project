Some of the layoffs are due to a decision to centralize the development of the flagship Evernote app in two cities \u2014 its headquarters in Redwood City, CA, and Zurich \u2014 rather than distribute the work globally.\nA tipster told The Verge that the layoffs included the head of product in Austin, as well as engineers, designers, and members of the support and quality assurance staff. The move raised fears among staffers that Evernote may close the office, which it opened two years ago to develop products like  Skitch and  Scannable . But the company said it would continue the development of Scannable, an app for scanning documents, in Austin.\nThese are the first layoffs to hit Evernote, a seven-year-old company that has raised $290 million and has more than 100 million users.
