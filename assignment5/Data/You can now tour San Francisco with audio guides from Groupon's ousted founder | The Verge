{"Main text":"You can now tour San Francisco with audio guides from Groupon's ousted founder\nAndrew Mason's Detour is now live in the App Store\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis summer  we told you about Detour , the new company from Groupon founder Andrew Mason dedicated to creating high-quality audio tours. After several months in private beta, Detour is now  open to the public : you can  download the iPhone app today . (An Android app is forthcoming.) Open it and you'll find seven tours of San Francisco, each focused on a different neighborhood or topic, narrated by different experts in the topic. In our tests, we found the app to be a fascinating guide to the city, with tours that play like particularly sharp episodes of This American Life.\nYou can pay $4.99 for an individual tour, or $20 for an annual subscription that gets you access to everything. Tours cover neighborhoods including the Tenderloin, the Marina, Union Square, and Fisherman's Wharf. A new tour will come out about once a month, Mason says.\nUnlike Groupon, rocketed to a $6 billion valuation, Detour is poised for slow growth: it's a media company as much as it's a technology company, and for now its product is available in a single city. But more are coming: Detour has partnered with popular radio show and podcast  Radiolab to create a tour of Austin, TX, that will be available in time for the South by Southwest festival next month.\n","Title":"You can now tour San Francisco with audio guides from Groupon's ousted founder | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
