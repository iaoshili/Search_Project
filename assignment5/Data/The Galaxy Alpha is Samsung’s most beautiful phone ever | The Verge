{"Main text":"The Galaxy Alpha is Samsung\u2019s most beautiful phone ever\nThis is what smart, efficient design looks like\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI\u2019ve already written about the subtle but important upgrade that Samsung made to its Note series with the addition of a metal frame to the new Note 4 and Note Edge devices. But preceding them on the announcement calendar was the similarly metal-rimmed Galaxy Alpha , which until today looked like a promising alternative to the Galaxy S5. Now that I\u2019ve held it in my hands, I can say it\u2019s so much more than that.\nThe Galaxy Alpha is terrifically thin and light, though that\u2019s not the first thing you\u2019ll notice about it. It happens to be damn good looking too. The sheen from those polished edges makes all the difference, combining with the lustrous Super AMOLED display to make a great first impression. Some devices look better in press photos than reality \u2014 the LG G Watch R is a recent example \u2014 but the Galaxy Alpha is exactly the opposite. You have to see it in person to appreciate its slick and refined look. Everything is appropriately proportioned, the 4.7-inch screen size feels just right, and ease of one-handed use is as good as you\u2019ll get from any device in that size class. Those who might have felt let down by the new Moto X moving to a larger 5.2-inch screen may find solace in Samsung\u2019s more compact Alpha. Ergonomically, this phone is a delight. I don\u2019t want to call it perfect, but it kind of is.\nI actually like a Samsung phone because of its design, not in spite of it\nLike the iPhone 5S, the Galaxy Alpha feels almost lighter than it should be. Scale up the iPhone\u2019s height and width to the size of a 4.7-inch display and you\u2019d have a device very similar to the Alpha. The chamfered metal edging is the same \u2014 good looking but also prone to scratching \u2014 and so is the comfortable fit in the hand. Samsung\u2019s handset seems to be anticipating the rumored 4.7-inch iPhone coming next week, and doing so in the best fashion possible. The Korean company has produced a phone that\u2019s attractive to the touch and to the eye, raising its game in time to fend off Apple\u2019s latest assault. Whatever new iPhone emerges from Cupertino on Tuesday will have to assert itself through more than just good looks and a fine feel in the hand.\nI'm not ready to crown the Galaxy Alpha as Samsung's best overall phone \u2014 for one, the size of its 1,860mAh battery worries me \u2014 but judged purely on its design and the desire it's produced in me to have it, this phone is a winner. It even manages to retain some of Samsung's familiar personality with its patterned surfaces and dimpled back. When paired with the iffy plastic of the past, they felt like the hallmarks of design failure, but here they add to the idiosyncratic appeal of the device.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"The Galaxy Alpha is Samsung\u2019s most beautiful phone ever | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","hands--on","design","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5865386"]}
