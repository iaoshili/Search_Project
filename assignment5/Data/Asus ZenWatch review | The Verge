{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSmartwatches have a pretty bad reputation for being ugly, mini computers that prioritize function far above form. Much of that criticism is deserved \u2014 just look at the first two Android Wear watches released this summer. There have been a few bright spots in the otherwise dreary world of smartwatch design ( Pebble\u2019s Steel and Motorola\u2019s Moto 360 come to mind), but if you care about how your watch looks, you\u2019re probably not wearing a smartwatch.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about Asus\u2019 ZenWatch. The $199.99 Android Wear-powered watch has a slim stainless steel design complemented by a nice brown leather strap, complete with a fancy metal clasp. Asus talks more about the ZenWatch\u2019s heart tracking, and the mood-measurement features that inspired its name, but I don\u2019t really care about any of that. This looks like a watch I actually want to wear, regardless of its features.\nOf course, the reason you buy a smartwatch instead of a traditional watch is for what it does, so good looks alone won\u2019t cut it in this world. A smartwatch needs to do a number of things to earn its title: provide quick access to notifications, tell the time, and last through the entire day without needing to be recharged (at the bare minimum), among other things. You can choose from any number of smartwatches to do those things, but if you want something that looks good on your wrist at the same time, you\u2019re going to want to check out the ZenWatch.\nSurvey the field of Android Wear watches available right now, and you\u2019ll see a lot of plastic and a lot of rubber. The ZenWatch is refreshingly devoid of either of those materials. It has an attractive brushed stainless steel body with a copper-colored band (Asus calls it \"rose gold\", but it\u2019s more like copper to my eyes) sandwiched between the two layers of plain steel. It\u2019s a good look that works with both casual and formal attire, which is a rarity in a sea of mostly dorky-looking smartwatches. The ZenWatch\u2019s design reminds me more of Apple\u2019s upcoming Watch than prior Android Wear watches.\nThe watch itself is thinner than most other smartwatches, and though the ZenWatch is bigger overall than the Pebble Steel, it\u2019s not uncomfortably big on my wrist, unlike the rather bulky Moto 360. It\u2019s still closer in size to a large men\u2019s watch than a unisex design, so those with smaller wrists might still find it too large.\nLike the Samsung Gear Live and LG G Watch, the ZenWatch has a square display. But the frame around the display is judiciously rounded, and the top even has a slight curve to it, softening the watch\u2019s appearance. The screen is a 1.63-inch, 320 x 320 pixel AMOLED panel, with good viewing angles and acceptable brightness levels. It\u2019s similar to the Samsung Gear Live\u2019s screen, but works better outdoors. My only real complaint with the ZenWatch\u2019s design is that the border surrounding the screen is a bit too large. I wish Asus either made the display larger or the watch smaller to eliminate it.\nThere\u2019s a single button on the underside of the watch to power it on and quickly access the Settings menu, but it\u2019s not really designed to be used often. The main points of interaction with the ZenWatch \u2014 and any Android Wear device \u2014 are through its touchscreen and with your voice.\nThe ZenWatch\u2019s strap is soft tan-colored leather, with a metal deployant clasp. You can quickly swap it for another band if the color or style isn\u2019t your fancy. The folding metal clasp is a nice touch: it looks nice, makes the watch easy to take on and off, and doesn\u2019t damage the strap the same way that traditional loop clasps do. On the downside, it adds thickness at the point of closure, so I often found the ZenWatch uncomfortable to wear while typing on a laptop. The strap is more durable than the Moto 360\u2019s, but it\u2019s still as pliable and comfortable as any other leather strap.\nThe ZenWatch needs to be charged every night or it won't make it through the next day\nThe ZenWatch doesn\u2019t have wireless charging, but requires a clip-on charging cradle for a Micro USB charger. You\u2019ll have to use that cradle every night. Like most Android Wear devices, I was able to get a solid day out of the ZenWatch before it needed to be recharged, but not much more. Turning off the convenient ambient display feature (which makes the ZenWatch practical as an actual watch) stretched battery life into the next day, but I was never able to go two full days without needing to charge it.\nThe ZenWatch runs the same Android Wear software as smartwatches from LG, Samsung, Sony, and Motorola, and it has the same set of features and limitations. We\u2019ve already gone in depth on Android Wear numerous times, so I encourage you to check out those earlier reviews if you\u2019re not familiar with it. Basically: you can see all of your phone\u2019s notifications on your wrist, send messages or perform Google searches with your voice, or do things like control your smart lights with one of the many apps that have been developed. It\u2019s a powerful platform, but still has a number of usability and reliability issues, which prevents me from recommending it to anyone without reservations.\nFor better or worse, the ZenWatch\u2019s performance is on par with other Android Wear watches, meaning that it\u2019s mostly fine, but can be annoyingly slow at times. It isn\u2019t as responsive to voice commands as the Moto 360, but that didn\u2019t prevent me from sending messages to my wife without touching my phone. More frustrating to me is the ZenWatch\u2019s poor response to the wrist motion to wake up the display.\nThe ZenWatch performs as well as any other Android Wear watch\nAsus isn\u2019t able to change the main interface of Android Wear (Google doesn\u2019t allow it), but it did add a few apps of its own for both the watch and your smartphone. The ZenWatch has a number of attractive exclusive watch faces that complement its more elegant design. Some of those can be customized to display extra information such as step count, watch battery life, phone battery life, or current weather conditions using Asus\u2019 smartphone app. I\u2019m particularly fond of the large digital face that I\u2019ve set to also display the date, my step count, phone battery, and weather. There\u2019s a camera remote, which turns the watch into a viewfinder for your phone\u2019s camera, along with a compass and a flashlight app that displays a solid color on the ZenWatch\u2019s display. (That last one\u2019s not very useful.)\nThe ZenWatch Manager app offers a few exclusive features that other Android Wear watches lack. It lets you set the ZenWatch as a trusted device on your phone, even if you don\u2019t have Android 5.0; sound an alarm on the ZenWatch in case you lost it in the couch cushions for some reason; or set up an alert on the watch if you leave your phone behind somewhere.\nAsus also offers a health and fitness app for both the watch and the phone that logs step counts, heart rates, and mood as measured by the ZenWatch. It\u2019s supposed to be the \"zen\" part of the ZenWatch. The Wellness app wouldn\u2019t work on my Android 5.0 Lollipop phone, but the watch portion still measured my steps and vitals.\nThe larger problem is the ZenWatch just isn\u2019t good for counting my steps or measuring my heart rate. Step counts varied wildly and were never in sync with the Fitbit I wear on my other wrist: sometimes they were thousands of steps higher, sometimes they were thousands of steps lower than what the Fitbit reported. The ZenWatch isn\u2019t a device I\u2019d wear at the gym anyways (the leather strap and metal body pretty much put that out of the question), but it\u2019s not too much to expect reliable step counting for my day-to-day activities and the ZenWatch fails in that regard.\nStep counts and heart rate measurements were all over the place\nMeasuring your heart rate on the ZenWatch isn\u2019t like with other smartwatches, which use a light underneath the watch to read your pulse. Instead, you place two fingers on the metal frame at the same time, completing an electrical circuit. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t any faster than the other method, and like the ZenWatch\u2019s step counter, can be all over the place with its readings. I\u2019m pretty sure my heart rate doesn\u2019t shift 100 beats per minute in two minutes of standing still, but that\u2019s often what the ZenWatch told me.\nFor all its faults and imperfect features, though, if I had to choose an Android Wear watch to wear every day, the ZenWatch would be it. It\u2019s less expensive than the LG G Watch R or Moto 360, but looks nicer and is more comfortable than either of those on my wrist. It\u2019s something I could just as easily wear out to a formal event as I would to work every day. Even my wife said it was a nice-looking watch, and sheÂ  hasn\u2019t been too kind to other smartwatches in the past.\nI\u2019d love to have more accurate step counting and better battery life, two things which could potentially be improved with software updates. I\u2019d also like Android Wear to be easier to use and more reliable, but that responsibility falls on Google more than Asus at this point. The ZenWatch makes the best of what\u2019s available with Android Wear right now, and I can\u2019t really ask for more than that.\nIf I had to choose an Android Wear watch, the ZenWatch would be it\nIf you\u2019re going to buy a smartwatch, you should buy something that you feel comfortable wearing all the time. The ZenWatch fits that bill, while still doing the things I want a smartwatch to do. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been able to say that about an Android Wear watch, and what makes the ZenWatch the Android Wear watch I\u2019d choose.\n","Title":"Asus ZenWatch review | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","review","tech"]}
