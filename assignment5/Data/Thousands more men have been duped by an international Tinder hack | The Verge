{"Main text":"Thousands more men have been duped by an international Tinder hack\nCatfishing men on Tinder is an international pastime\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEarlier this week,  The Verge reported on a hacker named \"Patrick\" who tweaked Tinder\u2019s API to dupe men who thought they were chatting with women into messaging with each other. Apparently, Patrick\u2019s hack was just the tip of the iceberg.\nA British hacker operating under the name Catfi.sh claims to be running a similar operation, but on a far greater scale: instead of running one bot, Catfi.sh is running up to 20 dummy profiles in the US and the UK at any given moment. Since launching his program shortly after Valentine\u2019s Day, he estimates he\u2019s ensnared 10,000 male users and relayed 100,000 messages. Every day, Catfi.sh says 200 new users fall for his bots and 2,500 new messages are sent.\nWhile Patrick designed his program as a joke with a slightly political bent, Catfi.sh originally developed his to make his Tinder experience more efficient. In effect, he says, \"I could trick other guys into talking to girls on my behalf.\" He created a digital ventriloquist act by transforming his own profile into a dummy. When a woman \"liked\" his profile, the program connected her to a random male Tinder user who would then communicate through Catfi.sh\u2019s profile. If the conversation was going well and approaching a date, Catfi.sh would come to life \u2014 reclaiming his profile and giving his ventriloquist the boot.\nThe system worked poorly, he says, but he discovered he could create the same double-headed catfish machine Patrick set up. \"I realized how hilarious the results were,\" he says, \"and haven\u2019t looked back since.\"\nUnlike Patrick, Catfi.sh didn\u2019t set up a telephone number scrambler. Sometimes, he says, the conversations include hundreds of messages and last weeks. On these occasions he sometimes steps in to sever the connection. But with so many messages in motion, he doesn\u2019t track the program as closely as Patrick. He believes that at least some of the men matched through his program have met up in real life.\nPeople have built Tinder bots before, but the scope of Catfi.sh\u2019s hack is staggering: he claims to currently have multiple bots operating in London, Glasgow, Manchester, New York, Houston, San Francisco, and elsewhere.\nEchoing Patrick, Catfi.sh says building bots on top of Tinder\u2019s API was \"very trivial.\"\n\"I was surprised by how little defense the Tinder API has,\" he adds. His program ran 24\/7, sending Tinder\u2019s API tens of requests per second from the same IP for over a month with no interference. (Tinder eventually did ban his IP and he now runs the program through Tor.)\n\"I can only assume that they haven't realized what's going on, although this becomes difficult to understand since someone at their end has clearly looked into me \u2014 they've manually banned several of my Facebook accounts and also an IP address,\" he says.\nReached for comment, Rosette Pambakian, Tinder\u2019s VP of Corporate Communications and Branding says, \"Keeping Tinder\u2019s ecosystem safe and enjoyable for our users is our top priority. We apologize to those who were affected by this misuse of our platform. Although this is not a security threat, we take these violations very seriously and will take action against accounts that deceive our users.\" She added that Tinder is looking to enhance anti-spam systems and add measures that would ensure that only Tinder clients can access the API.\nIn the meantime, Catfi.sh plans to continue running his bots. He\u2019s read so many of the conversations that they\u2019ve lost their novelty. \"But my friends enjoy them,\" he says, \"so I don\u2019t see a point to stop.\"\nIn the wake of The Verge\u2019s reporting, Catfi.sh went live with a site where he published 50  conversations he\u2019s gathered. They represent just 1 percent of what he has in stock so far.\nDoes Catfi.sh think there are other hackers running similar programs out there? \"Before Patrick, I would\u2019ve said no\u2026.But there are lots of programmers out there with a slightly mischievous side. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was a third.\"\nHacks like these pose an existential crisis for Tinder: social networks are built on trust, and if an individual can\u2019t be certain whether they\u2019re speaking with a crush, a bot, a marketer, or even a  brick , the app loses value. But this hack also poses a second, more intriguing question: between Patrick, Catfi.sh, hackers like them, and the thousands they\u2019ve fooled, how many men on Tinder are actually talking to a real woman?\nVerge Video: What is the future of sex?
