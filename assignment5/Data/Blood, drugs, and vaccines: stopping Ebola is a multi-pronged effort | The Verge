All had come to the University of Maryland, in Baltimore, to receive a dose of an experimental Ebola vaccine. \"We\u2019re finishing up our last set of vaccinations today,\" she says. And \"right around the new year, we will have the new data.\"\n\"We\u2019re finishing up our last set of vaccinations today.\"\nMonday was the last day of the University\u2019s early-stage Ebola vaccine trial involving healthy participants. It's aimed at determining whether the vaccine is safe, tolerable, and effective at provoking an immune response. The vaccine, called \"cAd3-EBOZ,\" is one of two Ebola vaccine candidates currently under human investigation in North America. The other vaccine, one that was developed by researchers at the Public Health Agency of Canada\u2019s National Microbiology Laboratory, begins human trials in Halifax, Nova Scotia this week.\n\"These two vaccines are the farthest along that are in clinical trials,\" says Scott Halperin, a microbiologist at Dalhousie University and one of the researchers investigating the vaccine in Halifax. But right now, it\u2019s hard to tell if either vaccine will make it to market. \"Until you actually test vaccines in humans, you really don\u2019t know which one will work.\"\nVaccines are at the forefront of research efforts to curb the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that has already claimed the lives of over 5,100 people. They\u2019re the type of intervention that could help those who are most at risk \u2014 healthcare workers and citizens in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone \u2014 protect themselves against infection. Yet both Lyke and Halperin are quick to caution against putting all our eggs in the preventative basket. To stop the spread of Ebola, the world also needs to stick to the basics of infectious disease interventions. And researchers need to explore treatments for those already infected as well, like \"convalescent whole blood\" \u2014 a treatment that essentially means injecting people with the blood of Ebola survivors.\nSurvivor blood and drugs\nThe World Health Organization recently  told scientists that they should the use the blood of Ebola survivors to treat others. The announcement was surprising to some because researchers have yet to conduct a large-scale clinical trial to look into its effectiveness.\n\"Based on what we know about science, it should work,\" Lyke says. Using antibodies contained in the blood of recovered patients is a well-established technique used for several infectious diseases. And several Ebola survivors,  including physician Kent Brantly , have already donated their blood to help treat Ebola patients.\nTransfusions from Ebola survivors \"should work.\"\nWithout a clinical trial, however, it's hard to determine how useful the transfusions have been, so the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium is planning a trial. \"What we need now is a well-designed study according to high ethic and scientific standards to confirm it works,\" says Roeland Scholtalbers, head of communications at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Belgium. In mid-December, the Institute will hold a trial in which 200 patients will receive blood or blood plasma from Ebola survivors. The trial will last about one year, but researchers hope to see results as early as March, which could inform a decision about possibly scaling up this intervention \u2014 or stopping the practice altogether.\nIf using the blood of survivors proves ineffective, there are a number of drug-based Ebola treatments that might yield some positive results. The  anti-Ebola drug Zmapp has already been given to a number of Ebola patients, and Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, was famously given the anti-viral brincidofovir before his death . Yet despite a favorable safety record, brincidofovir had only been tested against Ebola in petri dishes prior to being given to Ebola patients. And Zmapp \u2014 a drug that contains artificial antibodies \u2014 still hasn't undergone clinical testing, which means that we still don\u2019t know if it's effective, or even safe. Moreover, Zmapp is in extremely short supply, so many researchers have moved past it. \"We can\u2019t really give it to people anyways,\" Lyke says, \"until [the company that makes it] produces more.\"\nRecipe for an Ebola vaccine\nWithout an effective drug candidate or treatment, prevention becomes more important. Informing the public about how to avoid becoming infected is essential, but a vaccine could help thousands of people avoid the disease without having to think too much about it.\nThe two candidates that are being tested on humans are based on the same principles as all vaccines are. Both make use of an virus that normally infects non-human animals. To make an Ebola vaccine, scientists first manipulated a virus and deleted one of its genes. Then, they inserted a gene from the Ebola virus into the animal virus, so the animal virus manufactures Ebola proteins that are harmless to humans. \"So when the virus is given to people, and their bodies detect the Ebola protein on its surface, they make antibodies against that protein,\" Halperin says. A vaccinated individual would therefore already have the means to fight the virus off if they encountered Ebola in the environment.\nhealthy individuals have been more than willing to try the vaccine\nEach vaccine uses a different \"host\" virus: The Canadian vaccine makes use of a virus that normally infects cows, whereas the vaccine that's being tested in Maryland is based on a chimpanzee virus. That may lead to some differences between the way the two work. For instance, the Canadian vaccine has been shown to offer some protection to animals that have already been exposed to Ebola. \"About 50 percent of the non-human primates survived when they were given a dose of the vaccine after being given a lethal challenge of Ebola virus,\" Halperin says. If the Canadian vaccine is approved, it\u2019s possible that it might one day be used as a post-exposure treatment. The Maryland vaccine, on the other hand, shows a lot of promise, Halperin says, because the type of virus it uses tends to provoke immune responses \"quite easily\" in humans.\nCredit: NIAID\nIt\u2019s too early to tell if either of the vaccines will ever make it to market, given that neither has been used on humans with Ebola. But according to Lyke and Halpering, healthy individuals have been more than willing to try it out. \"There\u2019s a been huge response,\" Lyke says, \"People just want to participate.\"\nHalperin says that he received 150 calls over the weekend from people who wanted to participate in the trial, which was announced last Friday. \"When we announced that we were doing the study, we got about 30 phone calls within 20 minutes,\" he says. \"It\u2019s been remarkably easy to recruit volunteers.\" Halperin\u2019s trial will only involve 40 participants, so many keeners will have to be turned away once they\u2019ve been screened. Still, it\u2019s nice to see that degree of enthusiasm, Halperin says. Both research groups expect to have an idea of how safe their vaccines are, and which doses are optimal, after the new year.\nBack to basics\nThere\u2019s still an incredible amount of uncertainty surrounding the various Ebola drugs treatments and vaccines in development right now. The scientific principles behind them are sound, Lyke says, but \"there\u2019s nothing like Ebola. It\u2019s unique in terms of viruses.\" That makes it harder to treat; strategies that worked for other viruses could easily fail when confronted with this particular pathogen. As a result, Halperin and Lyke are both adamant that the best interventions remain those that we already know about.\n\"Prior to this outbreak,  Médecins Sans Frontières have always been able to contain [Ebola] using their tracking methods,\" Lyke says. So although \"this particular outbreak has been unusual,\" we already know how to stop Ebola. \"First and foremost, it\u2019s about having good sterile supplies along with IV fluids and the regular supplies that medical professionals need,\" Lyke says. Screening people for Ebola is also crucial. Down the line, she says, a vaccine might prove useful to stop the spread of Ebola, but it\u2019s important to keep focusing on providing healthcare workers with basic medical supplies and training.\n\"Ebola is a virus like many others.\"\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of public perception. There was  a lot of panic following the news of an Ebola patient in Dallas and later an Ebola patient in New York City, Halperin says, but \"Ebola isn\u2019t something that people in North America should be worrying about for themselves.\" In many ways, imagining a large Ebola threat in North America is hindering efforts to help people who are truly at risk. \"People here should be thinking about how to support what\u2019s going on in Africa, because this is a problem there, and our responsibility here is to do everything we can to assist.\"\nScholtalbers held similar opinions. \"I think it is important citizens worldwide are able to distinguish fact from fable,\" he says. \"There is an epidemic of irrational fear, while in the end, Ebola is a virus like many others.\"\n","Title":"Blood, drugs, and vaccines: stopping Ebola is a multi-pronged effort | The Verge","Tags":["report","science\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
