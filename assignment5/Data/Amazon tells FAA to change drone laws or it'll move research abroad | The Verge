Current rules make the commercial use of drones in the US \u2014 including test flights \u2014 illegal, and a planned overhaul of the law set to arrive in early 2015 could be even more restrictive , with licenses only issued after dozens of hours of flight in manned aircraft.\nAmazon has already begun exporting its research and is currently testing drones in Cambridge, England , where experimental flights don't require a special license and pilots are only expected to follow general rules such as staying away from large crowds and airports. The UK has already issued more than 300 licenses for commercial drone use with the majority used for photography and filming.\n","Title":"Amazon tells FAA to change drone laws or it'll move research abroad | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
