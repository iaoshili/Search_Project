{"Main text":"This is what Wonder Woman looks like in 'Batman v. Superman'\nComic-Con panel opens with surprise footage from Zack Snyder's big film\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDirector Zack Snyder surprised Comic-Con crowds this morning by opening up Warner Bros.' big panel with art and a teaser for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, as well as a first look at Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. While the footage isn't online, Snyder did tweet out the photo of Gadot \u2014 and it's perhaps the most exciting image that we've seen from the film to date. While Snyder's images  of Batman and Superman were both gray and moody, Wonder Woman appears to be staring something (or someone) down with intensity, while embers from a fire scatter all around her.\nFootage from the film was easily the most unexpected aspect of Snyder's presentation though, as the movie is still shooting and is planned for a release way out in 2016.  According to SlashFilm , the brief teaser begins with Batman in an armored suit that looks like it's right out of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns. Batman then turns on the Bat-signal, illuminating Superman up in the sky, who's staring down Batman. Clearly, the two aren't happy with one another. We're not sure how it'll play out just yet, but it sounds as though Snyder's film looks very good already.\nBelow, you can see the other three images that Snyder has released from the upcoming film.\n","Title":"This is what Wonder Woman looks like in 'Batman v.
