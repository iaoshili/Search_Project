{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been nearly a week since your girlfriend  Carly Rae Jepsen dropped her new single \"I Really Like You\" on the world, and it's still stuck in our heads. (We don't actually have a problem with that, to be honest.) Now, after we were  all but promised we'd see a music video featuring eternal It Guy Tom Hanks, here's the final product. And, in a knowing wink from Carly Rae herself, it's clear that she knows she can plant herself in your brain one more time.\nA knowing wink from Carly Rae herself\nHanks is the star of the video from beginning to end, as he pretty inexplicably lip-syncs Carly Rae up and down the streets of New York's Soho neighborhood on his way to a shoot with Ms. Jepsen. It's like any other day in a celebrity's life \u2014 dealing with fans, dodging paparazzi, getting random Tinder love \u2014 but like having \"Call Me Maybe\" stuck in your head on your way to work, Hanks just can't stop singing this new song. It's everywhere, all up until the moment he gives in with reckless abandon and dances with a group of complete strangers down a deserted street. As commentary on viral fame goes, all this might be sinister if it weren't so adorable.\nAnd then Justin Bieber showed up. Oh well. Whatever happens, get ready for this song to never leave your head ever.\n","Title":"Tom Hanks can't get Carly Rae Jepsen's new song out of his head in this new video | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment","music"]}
