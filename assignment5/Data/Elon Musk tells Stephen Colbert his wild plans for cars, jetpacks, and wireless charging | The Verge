{"Main text":"Elon Musk tells Stephen Colbert his wild plans for cars, jetpacks, and wireless charging\nAnd explains why he named his car Old Faithful\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast night, Stephen Colbert's guest on The Colbert Report was Elon Musk. And, after Musk dodged the question about his inevitable slide into supervillainy, he talked a bit about the future of Tesla, SpaceX, his plan to go to Mars, and a few ideas that are somehow even more ambitious.\nMusk told Colbert that he and SpaceX are focused on reusability for space flights: building a rocket that can take off, land, refuel, and take off again is incredibly important. He also says that he'll be sending people to space in two years. He talked about Tesla's desire to personalize your car, and told Colbert that he named his Old Faithful. But the most interesting part of the interview came when Musk asked Colbert what he wanted to see in the future. Colbert said he doesn't want cables, he really wants a jetpack, and then said he wanted wireless power to be everywhere, so we'd never run out of power again.\nMusk's response? \"Yeah, we'll do it.\" If we've learned one thing about Elon Musk over the years, it's that he probably means what he says.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
