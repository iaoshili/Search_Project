{"Main text":"Amazon brings one-hour delivery to New York City with Prime Now\nService rolls out in select areas of Manhattan today, with other cities coming in 2015\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon today  announced a new service called Prime Now, which promises one-hour delivery for a range of \"daily essentials.\" The service is available for Amazon Prime subscribers, and launches today in select areas of Manhattan. The company says it plans to introduce Prime Now to additional cities in 2015.\nTwo-hour delivery will be free\nWith Prime Now, Amazon customers can have books, toys, and everyday items like shampoo and paper towels delivered to their homes within one hour for $7.99. Two-hour delivery is free. The service will be available from 6 AM to midnight, seven days a week, with Amazon's new Manhattan facility serving as its hub.\nPrime Now is similar to older services like  Kozmo.com and  Urbanfetch , both of which offered one-hour delivery in New York and other major cities. Earlier this year, Google  expanded its Shopping Express same-day delivery service to New York and Los Angeles, as part of its ongoing bid to compete with Amazon Prime. It's not yet clear which cities will be next for Prime Now, but Amazon says it will notify users through the Prime app when it arrives in their area.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
