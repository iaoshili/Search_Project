{"Main text":"Ebola panic is getting pretty racist\nThe real culprits in Ebola's spread have been cuts to public health budgets\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe first time a reporter asked a CDC representative whether Thomas Duncan \u2014 the first patient to receive an Ebola  diagnosis in the US \u2014 was an American citizen, the question seemed pretty tame. One could excuse it as a general inquiry about the Duncan\u2019s nationality during the first press conference announcing his diagnosis. But after the CDC declined to answer, the question kept coming. \"Is he a citizen?\" reporters repeatedly asked. \"Is he one of us?\" they meant.\n\"Is he one of us?\" they meant.\nThe current Ebola crisis has been tinged with racism and xenophobia. The disease rages in West Africa, and has therefore largely infected people of color. But somehow Americans were among the first to get a dose of Zmapp \u2014 the experimental anti-Ebola drug \u2014 this summer, despite the fact that Africans have been dying from the current Ebola epidemic since its emergence in Guinea in December . There are a lot of reasons for that, of course. The drug is potentially dangerous and only exists in short supply. It\u2019s also extremely costly. And it originated in Canada , so it's unsurprising that North America controls its use.\nAnd now that Ebola has \"reached\" the US, American privilege \u2014 white  privilege, especially \u2014 is floating to the surface, in even less subtle  ways.\nFrom Vox.com : Living in a country ravaged by Ebola.\nThe difference in treatment for US patients and African patients is stark, beyond the use of experimental drugs. Some Ebola-stricken regions in West Africa don\u2019t have access to fuel to power ambulances, and many health workers lack the protective gear to stave off infection. Which is why it's so strange that Duncan's health has been used as an excuse to voice concerns about the presence of foreigners in Dallas. Instead of asking government officials why the WHO has a much smaller budget than the CDC or why it has suffered massive cuts in the last two years, Americans have preferred to focus on themselves.\nDuncan\u2019s health is an excuse to voice concerns about foreigners\nYesterday, The Raw Story wrote about how immigrants living in the same neighborhood as Duncan\u2019s family were facing immense discrimination. Some have been turned away from their jobs, David Edwards writes, while others have been refused service in restaurants. The color of their skin and their accents makes them a target, even though they never came into contact with Duncan, and therefore pose zero risk. It doesn\u2019t matter: they\u2019re dark-skinned and foreign. They\u2019re in Dallas. They might be infectious.\nNow, an ugly new hashtag has emerged: #Obola, a coinage that was popularized thanks to  a tweet by conservative writer Dinesh D\u2019Souza, and a Michael Savage radio segment . If you don\u2019t get the reference, I don\u2019t blame you. The President\u2019s name doesn't exactly resemble \"Ebola.\" But D\u2019Souza, a known \"birther,\" has somehow managed to liken a name like Obama with a disease that\u2019s raging in Africa \u2014 not in the US. Predictably, this has given racist xenophobic Americans a banner to rally around.\n#Obola is a terrorist.

Many have lost sight that the only way to become infected with Ebola is by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of someone who\u2019s showing symptoms. Others have ignored the fact that, so far, no one who came into contact with Duncan has developed symptoms of Ebola. Instead, there are calls for larger quarantines in Dallas \u2014 or a continent-wide one in Africa \u2014 which would only lead to more infections , and a greater sense of panic.\nXenophobic rhetoric has dehumanized individuals dealing with a terrible disease\nEbola is scary because it causes quick, gruesome deaths. But  it isn\u2019t easy to transmit . Had we acted sooner, had we prevented the WHO\u2019s budget from being cut, we probably wouldn\u2019t be dealing with such large numbers of infected people now. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know how to stop Ebola \u2014 we\u2019ve done it in the past. That\u2019s what we should be talking about. We should be asking why the first case of Ebola transmission outside Africa happened in Spain, a country that recently experienced public health cuts .\nWe\u2019re playing catch-up, and the CDC is optimistic. But when people spend more energy on dehumanizing individuals in Dallas than on urging politicians to help the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone, we all lose out.\n","Title":"Ebola panic is getting pretty racist | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world","essay\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5747384"]}
