No, it's not an iPhone case or a new iPad Air. It's  a $1,900 hand-painted pirate flag .\nThe Jolly Roger \u2014 sporting a classic, multi-colored Apple eyepatch \u2014 is central to Apple lore. The skunkworks team behind the original Macintosh hoisted the flag above their office on the Apple Campus as an embodiment of one of Steve Jobs' most famous slogans: \"It\u2019s better to be a pirate than join the navy.\"\nBack in 1983, when the Macintosh team moved into a new office building, programmer Steve Capps sewed together the black flag and asked graphic designer Susan Kare to paint the skull and crossbones on it. It's said that the flag flew over the office building for over a year before disappearing forever into the annals of computer history.\nNow Kare is selling bespoke replicas of the flag in two sizes: 3 feet by 5 feet and 4 feet by 6 feet for $1,900 and $2,500, respectively. That's a pretty penny, but each is hand painted and signed by Kare, who is a legend in her own right: she's the designer behind  the original Macintosh icons and fonts you all know and love.\n","Title":"Macintosh designer is selling $1,900 replicas of Apple's legendary pirate flag | The Verge","Tags":["apple","design"]}
