{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\n2015 will see Google launch a new model of its Glass headset, which will be powered by an Intel chip and offer longer battery life than the current Explorer Edition, according to The Wall Street Journal. Google Glass has already been through a couple of small iterative upgrades \u2014 one to add  compatibility with prescription lenses and another to  double the RAM \u2014 but the shift to a new processor could signal a more thorough overhaul of the entire wearable.\nLimited battery life and a forbidding, four-figure price tag have militated against Glass' widespread adoption up until now. With a more modern processor and a refreshed design, it could see consumer interest rekindled, though Intel seems more interested in promoting Glass as a workplace companion. The WSJ reports that the chipmaker's partnership with Google will include marketing Glass to \"hospital networks and manufacturers, while developing new workplace uses for the device.\"\nIt's not yet known what particular Intel hardware will be used to power the new Google Glass, though the likeliest candidate would be the low-power chip at the heart of  Intel's MICA bracelet . MICA is the product of Intel's  New Devices Group , which was set up last year \"to investigate what new kinds of devices will help drive the next stage of the microprocessor revolution.\" Perhaps its most salient spec relative to Google Glass is that Intel's wearable promises to last up to two days, which \u2014 if it can be recreated in the smaller dimensions of Glass \u2014 would lead to a doubling of the battery life of Google's original Glass headset.\n","Title":"Google Glass will return in 2015 with Intel inside, says WSJ | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"2689413"]}
