{"Main text":"Fitbit's newest fitness trackers are still causing skin irritation\nCompany says 'very limited percentage of users' developing rashes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFitbit is still irritating some of its customers. A year after the company had to pull its Fitbit Force from the market over complaints it was causing skin conditions, a number of users of the  Fitbit Surge health tracker have taken to Twitter  to document rashes and signs of skin irritation  reportedly caused by wearing the device . Fitbit has responded the complaints \u2014 which show red blotches and broken skin on wearers' wrists \u2014 by suggesting customers keep their $250 Surges dry, clean, and that they \"give [their] wrists a rest.\"\nHaving a break from my @fitbit Surge.

Fitbit says such reactions are \"not uncommon with jewelry or wearable devices that stay in contact with the skin for extended periods,\" and should disappear within hours or days when users take the device off.\n@fitbit your surge gave me an awesome rash pic.twitter.com\/d0reusablh\n\u2014 Batophobe(Huntboi) (@Batophobe) February 7, 2015\nThis is the second time the company has had to deal with this problem. Last year, Fitbit CEO James Park  issued an apology to customers affected by skin irritation caused by the Fitbit Force health tracker. A week later, the device was taken off the market entirely while the issue was investigated. At the time, Park said only 1.7 percent of customers reported that their Force tracker caused irritation, but the issue apparently remains with the Surge.\nFitbit's fitness trackers are designed to monitor your activity at all hours of the day: the top-of-the-range Surge has eight sensors and GPS to monitor your activity and position during workouts, and can even track your sleeping habits. Removing the tracker might clear the problems up, but wearables need to be worn to be functional \u2014 forcing users to take the device off for days at a time to avoid developing nasty skin conditions makes the $250 Surge a less enticing prospect.\n","Title":"Fitbit's newest fitness trackers are still causing skin irritation | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
