{"Main text":"Swatch announces new touchscreen watch with fitness features\nA Swatch smartwatch is still coming\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile we wait for Swatch to show off its  upcoming smartwatch this spring , the company has decided to update its current touchscreen offering, the Swatch Touch. The  Swatch Touch Zero One is a fitness watch geared toward volleyball players. It can track calories burned and steps taken, but it's mainly designed to track and focus on volleyball-specific maneuvers like low hits, high hits, power hits, and high-fives. The Touch Zero One will send that information to Swatch's app, where your skills as a volleyball player will be ranked from zero to 100. The Touch Zero One won't win any design awards with its yellow, clunky watch face and multi-colored band, but it's designed for function, not fashion. The Swatch Touch Zero One will retail for $160 once it's released later this year.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
