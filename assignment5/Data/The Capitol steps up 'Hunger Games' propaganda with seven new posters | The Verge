{"Main text":"The Capitol steps up 'Hunger Games' propaganda with seven new posters\nLionsgate releases promotional images ahead of 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPanem loves its citizens. At least, that's what the Capitol would like everyone to believe. Ahead of the upcoming release of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Lionsgate has released a series of posters depicting seven \"District Heroes.\" This isn't the first time that The Hunger Games' marketing team has attempted to bridge the gap between reality and fiction. Last year saw the release of an intricate, fashion-themed website called Capitol Couture that entwined fake interviews with sly nods to the second film in the series, Catching Fire.\nMuch like the world in the movies, the promotional material has changed in tone. Instead of designer labels, the glossy new images are branded with nationalistic slogans like \"our future is in your hands,\" and \"Panem Today, Panem Tomorrow, Panem Forever.\" Every representative is dressed in a manner symbolic of their home regions, which are each responsible for a different industry. The Livestock District's Felix Stam, for example, is lushly garbed in thick, dark furs and pictured with a serene-looking goat.\nThe details in the posters are magnificent yet disquieting, hinting at the socio-political issues afflicting the fictional nation. In spite of the ostensible honor of their positions, none of the \"District Heroes\" smile. Most stare impassively at the camera, some glower. The most haunting photo belongs to Lily Elsington, the six-year-old ambassador from District 12. On the Capitol's website , she is described as \"ready, willing, and eager to fuel the Panem of tomorrow.\" But the unhappy, soot-glazed ragamuffin displayed in the accompanying image looks anything but that.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is slated to debut later this year, on November 21st, with the conclusion of the dystopian series to follow on November 20th, 2015.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n\"After shorting out, then quickly repairing District 3\u2019s mainframe at the age of nine, Fibre Bissette, 32, has proven her fearlessness in the face of any challenge.\"\n\"The proud daughter of a deep-sea fisherman and a sixth-generation pearl diver, Naida Dolan, 22, channels her legacy as she proudly holds the day\u2019s catch.\"\n\"Thought to have gasoline pumping through his veins, Malcolm Kastel, 31, is devoted to District 6\u2019s mission of keeping Panem moving.\"\n\"Elias Haan, 26, has kept the axe handed down to him by his great-grandfather as a reminder of the hardships he and his great District have overcome.\"\n\"After a day in the fields, Triti Lancaster, 17, graciously offers a bundle of wheat to her fellow citizens of Panem.\"\n\"Raised amongst the herd, Felix Stam, 35, possesses a quiet understanding of the ways of animals and the circle of life that unites us all.\"\n","Title":"The Capitol steps up 'Hunger Games' propaganda with seven new posters | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","design","entertainment"]}
