{"Main text":"Motorola will offer customization options for the Moto 360 smartwatch\nMoto Maker expands\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMotorola's Moto Maker website has thus far been used exclusively for customizing Motorola smartphones, but starting next month it will expand to include the Moto 360 smartwatch,  Wired reports . The updated website will let users pick from the various options that are already available for the Moto 360, but instead of just choosing, say, \"Black case with leather band,\" they'll be able to mix and match different options.\nFor casings, Motorola will offer black, silver, and champagne gold colors, while the band options will be expanded. There will be two sizes each of leather and metal bands and a new single-link metal band. Finally, Motorola will release a few new watch faces, one of which you can set as the default from the website when you place your order.\nIt's a natural progression for Moto Maker, and if you wanted to, you could see it as thumbed nose at Apple. In  the recent New Yorker profile of Jony Ive , he clearly cast aspersions at Moto Maker's customizability options. But Motorola is undeterred, telling Wired that \"people are going to be more emotionally connected to their device if they're part of the design process.\" As for the Apple Watch, we don't yet know if Apple intends to let customers mix and match bands and watch colors, but  John Gruber has speculated that it may not , which makes sense given Ive's apparent disdain for customizable designs.\nNo word yet on when Moto Maker will be updated and what the pricing options might be.\n","Title":"Motorola will offer customization options for the Moto 360 smartwatch | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
