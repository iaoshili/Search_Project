{"Main text":"Watch the magic of sound and science in 'Cymatics'\nSound never looked so good\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTallying up nearly two million views across  Vimeo and  YouTube in two weeks, my favorite thing on the internet today is still \"Cymatics,\" a music video from Nigel Stanford from his new album  Solar Echoes . Stanford put together a series of science experiments that demonstrate how sound can move matter around and combined them into a pretty solid music track and a very awesome video. As explained in the  making-of post , Stanford and director  Shahir Daud filmed the demonstrations first and then took the sound that made them and created the track with it second \u2014 but don't let that take away from the magic here. The magic is science, and also the magic is a dude wearing a full-body chain mail Faraday suit getting zapped with a Tesla coil while using a kick drum to turn a stream of water into a perfectly formed spiral. Science!\nIt's possible you've seen the following affected by sound before: a chladni plate, water, ferro fluid, a plasma ball, a ruben's tube, and a Tesla coil. It's hard to believe you've seen them all manipulated by the same song in the same video before, nor done so well. You can watch a  bunch of videos detailing how each shot was created here .\n","Title":"Watch the magic of sound and science in 'Cymatics' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","science"]}
