{"Main text":"One year later, the Comcast merger apocalypse still isn't here\nAnd suddenly, everything looks different\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne year ago today, Comcast  announced a deal : it planned to merge with rival Time Warner Cable in a transaction worth north of $45 billion. The two cable giants could become one; federal regulators could approve the merger with a few swift stroke of their pens. \"We believe that this transaction is approvable,\" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said simply, as  executives prophesied the deal would be done by the end of 2014.\nAnd yet, we're still waiting. Nearly as quickly as the deal was announced, customer service horror stories about Comcast, always at a hum in discussions about the company, seemed to amplify. Writers, activists, and consumers all shared anecdotes online and with the FCC, testifying to why Comcast deserved the ignominious title \" worst company in America .\" Less than subtle  political machinations were uncovered. Tom Wheeler, former telecom lobbyist and FCC Chairman, was called a dingo during early talks on net neutrality, but suddenly, he's moving forward with  Title II net neutrality rules while  changing the definition of broadband .\nThe merger, once thought by some to be a fait accompli, might not be so assured. The ground beneath Comcast and Time Warner Cable shifted. It's not over just yet \u2014 the FCC will make a decision in the coming months \u2014 but here, briefly, is how things started going south for Comcast.\nWhy you should be scared of Comcast and Time Warner Cable merging\nOn the day of the announcement, skepticism was  already setting in :\n[W]ith the addition of Time Warner Cable, an emboldened Comcast will suddenly have a presence in every major media market in the United States, stretching from Los Angeles to New York City.\nComcast has very bad reasons for wanting to buy Time Warner Cable\nComcast made its case for the merger, but the numbers  didn't add up :\nThere is absolutely no way that Comcast can argue it would have meaningful competition in wired broadband or cable after the merger. It\u2019s impossible. Comcast was estimated to have about 20.7 million broadband subscribers and 21.7 million video subscribers at the end of 2013; Time Warner Cable counted about 11 million for both categories.\nThe worst company in America\nMore and more people, either inside Comcast or paying for service, came out with stories  critical of the company :\nIn mid-July, AOL executive Ryan Block placed a call to Comcast customer service in an effort to cancel his service. What ensued was an 18-minute, Kafkaesque struggle with an overly persistent employee, which Block partially recorded and posted online. The recording went viral, and has now been listened to more than 5 million times.\nPoliticians are supporting Comcast's TWC merger with letters ghostwritten by Comcast\nThe spotlight started shining on Comcast, and it  wasn't always pretty :\nFor instance, a letter sent to the FCC by a town councilman from the small community of Jupiter, Florida, was in fact largely orchestrated by some of the biggest players in corporate telecom.\nNet Neutrality wins: the FCC will propose strong Title II regulation\nThe FCC continued to review the merger, but delays set in. Meanwhile, the commission decided to take  a forceful regulatory stance on net neutrality, suggesting it's not as opposed to battling telecoms as once thought:\nIt's a striking victory for net neutrality advocates who have been fighting for years to solidify internet protections using Title II authority \u2014 and it's the first time the FCC has shown enough backbone to draw a line in the sand against companies like Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon, who are sure to fight viciously in courts to reverse this action.\nLearn more\n","Title":"One year later, the Comcast merger apocalypse still isn't here | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","tech"]}
