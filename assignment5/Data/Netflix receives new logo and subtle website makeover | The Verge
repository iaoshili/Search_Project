{"Main text":"Netflix receives new logo and subtle website makeover\nDesktop only for now\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Netflix website now looks cleaner and more modern, thanks to a redesign that includes a slightly transparent top bar and a palette of white and light greys. The streaming giant's previous, white-on-red logo has also been conspicuously replaced by the simpler version seen in the latest season of Orange is the New Black. Lacking the heavy drop shadows that defined its predecessor, the updated emblem uses flat, red text with minimal embellishment.\nThe recent updates appear to be largely cosmetic and unique to the desktop version of the website. Netflix has always been conscientious about how its overall presentation affects its users, and has revamped its look multiple times. Last year, the company  revised its television interface dramatically, making it more attractive and user-friendly.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
