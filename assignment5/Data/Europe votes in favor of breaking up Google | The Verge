{"Main text":"US & World\nEurope votes in favor of breaking up Google\nThe European Parliament can't force Google to change, but its call for 'non-discriminatory online search' gives others the mandate to act\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe European Parliament has today approved a non-binding resolution calling for the \"unbundling of search engines from other commercial services\" in order to ensure \"competitive conditions within the digital single market.\" This proposal stirred up plenty of discontent when it wasÂ  revealed a week ago , but it has been affirmed in its original form today, including the controversial unbundling provision. Without the authority to act on this resolution itself, the European Parliament is asking the European Commission and the EU's member states to ameliorate Google's dominant and apparently discriminatory position in online search by forcing it to decouple its search and ads businesses. The language is strong, describing search engines as \"gatekeepers\" that are of particular importance, and urging the Commission \"to enforce EU competition rules decisively.\"\nToday EP gives strong political mandate against monopoly: unbindling search engines if needed #Google #antitrust pic.twitter.com\/VJQoQSYpvj\n\u2014 Ramon Tremosa (@ramontremosa) November 27, 2014\nThe other important provision in today's resolution is the Parliament reiterating its unqualified support for net neutrality:\n\"All internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference, irrespective of its sender, receiver, type, content, device, service or application.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
