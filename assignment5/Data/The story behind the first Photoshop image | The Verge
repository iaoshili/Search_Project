{"Main text":"The story behind the first Photoshop image\n\"Jennifer in Paradise\" was the software's first color test picture\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen John Knoll took a photo of his topless girlfriend on a secluded beach in 1987, he didn't expect the picture to be pored over and manipulated by thousands of people. But John's brother Thomas was  working on the software that became Photoshop , and \"Jennifer in Paradise,\" as the picture came to be known, was the perfect candidate for the program's first color test image.  As The Guardian explains in its consideration of the photo's importance, John and Thomas often used the picture of Jennifer \u2014 once John's girlfriend, now wife \u2014 to perform demonstrations of their software. Those demonstrations, and the photo itself, helped Photoshop become the de facto name in image manipulation.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
