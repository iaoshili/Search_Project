To break through that anonymity, agents had to get creative \u2014 but new documents suggest that in catching the culprit, the FBI may have committed a crime of its own.\nDocuments uncovered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation show that the FBI created a fake web page designed to look like a Seattle Times article, and used the page to spread tracking malware onto the suspect's computer. Creating dummy pages is a common way to spread malware \u2014 typically known as spoofing \u2014 but it's more common among criminals than law enforcement, and many are already interpreting the fake page as an attack on the press. \"We are outraged that the FBI, with the apparent assistance of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, misappropriated the name of The Seattle Times,\" a Times editor told the paper . \"Not only does that cross a line, it erases it.\" The Associated Press echoed the concern, saying, \"this ploy violated AP\u2019s name and undermined AP\u2019s credibility.\"\nThat the FBI impersonated a newspaper's website to deliver malware to a target is outrageous. Over the top crazy.\n\u2014 Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) October 27, 2014\nCalled CIPAV , the FBI's spyware tool is designed to harvest a computer's IP address, MAC address, and most recent session login \u2014 effectively identifying the person who visited the page. In this case, agents sent a message to the suspect's Myspace page, containing a link to the dummy article. Once the suspect clicked on the link, the page covertly uploaded CIPAV to the suspect's computer, leading agents back to the person running the page. But there's still a lot of secrecy surrounding the CIPAV tool, particularly the bureau's protocols for deploying the spyware. Today's revelations suggest they may be covering up some unsettling tactics.\n10\/28 12:31pm ET: Updated to include Associated Press statement.\n","Title":"The FBI created a fake malware-spreading newspaper article to trace a bomb threat | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","national-security"]}
