{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis weekend Divergent is going head-to-head with Muppets Most Wanted, and with the summer movie season just around the corner there\u2019s going to be even more interesting match-ups on the way. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\n'The Maze Runner'\nAn adaptation of a popular young adult novel? Check. A grim future landscape? Got it. A rigid social order that\u2019s upended when one person dares to break the rules? You bet. This trailer for the adaptation of James Dashner\u2019s novel arrives just in time to get the attention of the Divergent crowd \u2014 and people that really like mazes.\n'Maleficent'\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a better bit of casting than Angelina Jolie as this classic Disney villain. Along with a glimpse at Maleficent\u2019s wings, this latest trailer also gives us a good look at Sharlto Copley (District 9) as King Stefan, better known as the father of Sleeping Beauty.\n'The Giver'\nAn adaptation of a popular novel? An oppressive future landscape? A regimented social order? No, this isn\u2019t a trailer repeat; it\u2019s The Giver. The big difference this time is the rather impressive cast \u2014 it features Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep \u2014 and the presence of director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger).\n'The Signal'\nThis trippy sci-fi flick debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, where it was one of our movies to watch . In his sophomore effort, director William Eubank tells the story of two MIT students tracking a hacker through the desert\u2026 before everything they know changes.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018The Maze Runner,\u2019 \u2018Maleficent,\u2019 \u2018The Giver,\u2019 and 'The Signal' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
