{"Main text":"Humanity is running out of oxygen in the trailer for 'Air'\nNorman Reedus from 'The Walking Dead' is fighting to survive\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou might consider yourself lucky if you survive the apocalypse, but if sci-fi movies are anything to go off of, what comes next is rarely a joyride. In Air, it looks like The Walking Dead star Norman Reedus and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Blood Diamond) are about to find that out for themselves. The two are the sole caretakers of an underground bunker that holds that last remnants of humanity in a deep cryogenic freeze.\nUnlike many of the sci-fi flicks being shown off at Comic-Con, Air looks like a slow burn of a thriller where the real dangers are mental, not physical. As Skybound Entertainment, the studio behind The Walking Dead TV show, games, and comics, explains, their \"sanity is tested as they struggle to survive in the last bit of habitable space on Earth.\"Â  According to The Hollywood Reporter , the low-budget film is produced by Robert Kirkman (also of The Walking Dead), and co-written by Christian Cantamessa, whose writing experience comes from video games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Red Dead Redemption.
