The company's design chief Jony Ive and famed industrial designer Marc Newson spent a year and a half working together on more than 40 different product designs \u2014 including some one-off Apple products \u2014 for last year's (Red) auction in New York. Now Newson's joined Apple's design team,  Vanity Fair reports.\nFrom charity work, to new Apple gear\nIve and Newson designed and remixed  all sorts of products for last year's auction,  which raised millions for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. That list includes 18k rose gold Apple EarPods and a red Mac Pro, alongside a very special one-off Leica camera made out of anodized aluminum, and even  a solid aluminum desk. It's unclear what projects he'll be doing at Apple, with Vanity Fair noting that Newson will work out of both the UK and Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.\nIve and Newson's aluminum table for the (Red) auction last year.\nNewson is an award winning designer, whose work includes everything from clothing, to shoes, watches, boats, restaurants, and even cabins for airplanes and spaceships. Vanity Fair notes that he's become close, personal friends with Ive over the years, and has been working on projects with Apple already.\nThere's a 38-minute interview with the pair and Charlie Rose over at Hulu .
