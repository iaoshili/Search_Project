MSN News, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, Sports, and Weather are all making their way to iOS and Android today, with the Weather iOS app coming soon. Microsoft is also releasing each app on Amazon's App Store for Kindle Fire and Fire Phone owners. All of the apps have been available on Windows and Windows Phone exclusively for months, originally as unique apps that were used to demonstrate the benefits of Microsoft\u2019s own platform. Microsoft is also taking advantage of Apple's HealthKit integration with the Health & Fitness app, allowing iPhone users to track steps and activity using the app.\nMicrosoft\u2019s move to bring these apps to rival platforms is the latest in a series of changes that position the company as a provider of services and apps for iOS, Android, and Windows.
