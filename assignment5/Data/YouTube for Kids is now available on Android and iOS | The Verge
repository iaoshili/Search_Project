{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe YouTube app that parents have always clamored for is now here:  just as expected , the company has today released YouTube for Kids, celebrating it as \"the first Google product built from the ground up with little ones in mind.\" Available for Android and iOS (and coming soon for kiddie tablets like the Kurio and Nabi), YouTube for Kids offers a curated selection of videos that are appropriate for young viewers.  Like Vine's own kids app , everything is contained in a \"bright and playful design\" meant to grab and hold the attention of younger users. YouTube for Kids is broken up into four sections: shows, music, learning, and explore. And with this being YouTube, you'll find a pretty extensive vault of popular children's content from Reading Rainbow, DreamWorks TV, Jim Henson TV, Mother Goose Club, Talking Tom and Friends, and others.\nA number of parental controls are built in. There's a timer that sets viewing limits, and you've also got sound options at your disposal to cut off music or sound effects if you've heard all the Thomas the Tank Engine you can stand for one day. Search can also be disabled, a move that restricts your kids programming options to what's on the app's home screen. YouTube says it's just getting started with the app and is inviting parents to send in feedback; there's a space for doing so built right into the app.\n","Title":"YouTube for Kids is now available on Android and iOS | The Verge","Tags":["apple","google","apps","tech"]}
