{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft has started rolling out a new Windows Phone update to its range of Lumia devices.  Dubbed Lumia Denim , the latest update brings some significant camera improvements to the Lumia 830, Lumia 930, Lumia Icon, and Lumia 1520. The first noticeable change is a new Lumia Camera app that launches faster and takes photos more quickly. Microsoft\u2019s Lumia 1520 has a more than capable camera, but the slowness of capturing photos often lets it down, and this update is designed to address that.\nHey Cortana command also part of Lumia Denim\nThe new Lumia Camera update also includes support for recording 4K-quality videos, improved capture for auto HDR, and Dynamic Flash. While the camera improvements are rolling out Microsoft\u2019s high-end Lumias, they don\u2019t appear to be arriving on the Lumia 1020, with no mention of additional support for the 41-megapixel shooter. Other improvements include a new \u201CHey Cortana\u201D command that will activate Microsoft\u2019s digital assistant on a Lumia 930 or Lumia 1520.\nMicrosoft is rolling out Lumia Denim to some Lumia handsets today in various countries, but it warns that \u201Ca wider rollout of Lumia Denim to all Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone 8.1 is expected to begin in early January, following partner testing and approvals.\u201D Lumia 520, 530, 625, and Lumia 1320 are starting to receive the update broadly, and some Lumia 930 and Lumia 1520 owners are also seeing the new changes. Given that Verizon customers are still waiting on the previous Lumia Cyan update to roll out, it could be some time before all Lumia Windows Phones receive Denim. If you want to check on availability for your own Lumia  Microsoft has a support site listing the roll out for each country and device.\n","Title":"Microsoft's Lumia Denim update arrives with big camera improvements | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tech"]}
