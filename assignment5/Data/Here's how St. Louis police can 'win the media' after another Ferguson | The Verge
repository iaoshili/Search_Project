{"Main text":"Here's how St. Louis police can 'win the media' after another Ferguson\nPolice academy offers 'highly entertaining' course on 'feeding the animals'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen protests erupted over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown last month, police in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson responded with heavy force and tone deaf comments. Now, the St. Louis police academy is apparently looking to correct course with a \"highly entertaining\" class on how officers can \"win the media\" after shooting civilians.\nAs  Gawker reports , the St. Louis County and Municipal Police Academy recently posted a  flyer outlining a new course called \"Officer-Involved Shooting \u2014 You Can Win The Media.\" The one-day program will be led by former Chicago TV anchor Rick Rosenthal and promises to be a fun time for all, with \"numerous video clips\" and \"NO PowerPoint!\" Using the Michael Brown tragedy as a case study, attendees will learn about \"feeding the animals,\" \"managing media assault and battery,\" and \"managing media when things get ugly (think Ferguson).\" They'll also realize that \"no comment is a comment,\" the flyer promises, while making the acquaintance of a \"900-pound gorilla.\"\nWe are joke to them. Read that flyer. This is entertainment for them. Animals. Gorillas. Not even subtle.\n\u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 20, 2014\nThe all-day course costs $75 and is limited to 80 officers, though it's not clear how many have signed up. The flyer has already drawn criticism from some who have taken issue with its language, suggesting that \"animals\" and \"gorilla\" are shorthand for protesters or reporters. You can read the full flyer below.\n","Title":"Here's how St. Louis police can 'win the media' after another Ferguson | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5770102"]}
