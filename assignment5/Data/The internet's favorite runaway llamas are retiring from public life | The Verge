{"Main text":"The internet's favorite runaway llamas are retiring from public life\n:-(\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been over a month since Llama 1 and Llama 2 stole our hearts during a  glorious high-speed chase through Sun City, Arizona. Now it looks like the furry celebs \u2014 whose names are Kahkneeta and Laney \u2014 have had their last taste of sweet, sweet fame. The USDA contacted the llamas' owners soon after the chase, saying they needed a license to showcase the animals at public events,  The Guardian reports . And the owners, Bub Bullis and Karen Freund, are not happy about it.\nBye llamas\n\"They just totally destroyed everything I had planned for my retirement,\" Freund told The Guardian. \"We\u2019ve taken [the llamas] to schools before. Now they\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t do anything, even like a photo shoot.\"\nThe USDA requires any warmblooded animals being displayed in public or used in educational presentations to be  licensed with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) . Certain animal exhibitors, like those in state fairs or animal preserves, are exempt. Kahkneeta and Laney, however, are not. Bullis and Freund have since attempted to contact the USDA, but because all correspondence must be done in writing, they've given up, The Guardian reports.\nNext month, the llamas will retire to a farm in Chino Valley, Arizona. Until we meet again, you beautiful creatures.\n","Title":"The internet's favorite runaway llamas are retiring from public life | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr"]}
