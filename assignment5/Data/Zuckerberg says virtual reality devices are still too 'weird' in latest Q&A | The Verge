Speaking at Facebook\u2019s third  \"town hall\" meeting (informal Q&As with users to get feedback about the site), the 30-year-old said the current crop of augmented reality and virtual reality hardware was still \"very, very rough\" but in as soon as 10 years' time they\u2019ll be the main way we access the internet.\n\"It won't look weird like some of the stuff that exists today.\"\n\"I think it\u2019s pretty easy to imagine that in the future we will have something that we can wear,\" said Zuckerberg, speaking from Bogotá in Colombia. \"It will look just like normal glasses \u2014 it won\u2019t look weird like some of the stuff that exists today.\" Zuckerberg\u2019s comments seems directed at the likes of Google Glass, but he also admitted that even the Facebook-owned Oculus Rift is at a similar, \"extremely early stage,\" comparing the current playing field as a whole to the first \"terrible\" mobile phones.\nPost by Q&A with Mark .\n\"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be ten years, or 15, or 20 but there will be another platform after computers that becomes the primary computing platform and we\u2019re really excited to build that,\" said Zuckerberg. \"We\u2019re working on that with Oculus, who we think are by far the leader in virtual reality at this point, and it\u2019s going to be very exciting to see how that develops.\"\nThe future will be full of social companies \u2014 and Facebook already owns a few\nAs well as answering questions on the future of computing, Zuckerberg also talked about the future of Facebook, saying that the biggest trend by far was simply going to be the increase in internet access around the world \u2014 \"I really think that in 10 years \u2026 more than two-thirds of people should be on the internet\" \u2014 but that there would also be a proliferation of firms providing social services. \"In the future there will be a bunch of companies that are doing great work,\" said Zuckerberg, adding that Facebook already owns a few of them. \"We have the Facebook product, we also have Messenger. Whatsapp joined us, Instagram joined us.\"\nZuckerberg was also questioned on the apparent hypocrisy of touting grand ideas about \"connecting people\" and encouraging expression, while also adhering to censorship rules of countries that Facebook operates in. \"The real question that we ask is \u2018does that actually give more people the ability to express more things?\u2019\" he said, adding that if you break the law in a country then that country will just block Facebook entirely, leading to even less communication. \"It becomes a very tricky calculus. We try to push back \u2026 [but] I can\u2019t think of many examples in history where a company not being in a country in protest of a law has actually changed that law.\"\n","Title":"Zuckerberg says virtual reality devices are still too 'weird' in latest Q&A | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
