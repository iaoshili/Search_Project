The problem was in the execution: netbooks were poorly made, slow, ugly, thick, hard to use, too small, didn\u2019t last long enough, and were just generally a mean thing to force upon anyone you care about.\nWindows manufacturers ran away from the netbook after it was attacked on all sides. By tablets, which were longer-lasting and easier to use; by smartphones, which became powerful enough to do most things; and by Chromebooks, which quickly ate up the ultra-cheap laptop market. But a Chromebook is just a netbook with a better sense of timing. Google got into the $200 laptop game only when there was enough cheap computing power available that it could offer a decent experience in an inexpensive package. It\u2019s actually not hard to build a good, cheap laptop anymore.\nMicrosoft has also been working for years to make Windows 8.1 into a platform that works on any device, in any situation. Even as computing power became commoditized, Microsoft began to offer desktop software that doesn\u2019t need much power at all.\nPut it all together and the next step is obvious: Microsoft is back into the cheap laptop game. I\u2019ve been using the first attempt, the $199 HP Stream 11, for a few weeks. It\u2019s an 11-inch laptop, with everything a Windows device should have except for the high price tag.\nThe work\u2019s not over yet, for Microsoft or anyone, but I think it might be time \u201Cnetbook\u201D stopped being a bad word.\nI have a hard time imagining the Stream 11 in a Fortune 500 board room or in one of those British Airways first class seats that reclines all the way down. This just isn\u2019t a particularly professional-looking device. It\u2019s the colors: the Stream 11 comes not in black or silver, but in pink and blue. Neither is what I would call business-friendly. Or subtle. My blue review unit shifts in color from a royal blue on the lid to a sort of sea-foam blue on the palm rest; I like how it looks on my coffee table, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be terribly intimidating using it to engineer a hostile takeover.\nDo you run a Dave & Buster's? This'll fit right in\nIt\u2019s made of smooth plastic, matte on the outside and a speckled polka-dot design on the palm rest. It\u2019s mostly very well-made, its sturdy and cohesive design flecked only by the occasional lip where two pieces of plastic don\u2019t come together quite right. It\u2019s both thin and light, at 2.74 pounds and little over three-quarters of an inch thick. It feels noticeably bulkier than the thin, sharp-edged MacBook Air or any of a number of Windows ultrabooks, but among $200 laptops, this one is hard to beat. Even the small scuffs on its plastic lid tends to accrue come off with a little spit-shining.\nOther than the color, there\u2019s exactly nothing strange or even interesting about the Stream 11\u2019s design. It has USB and HDMI ports on one side, an SD card slot on the other, an overwhelmingly mediocre set of speakers on the bottom, and a bad-but-usable webcam.\nIt has an 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 pixel display that is exactly the same as almost every other screen like it \u2014 it\u2019s pixelated and dim, and has terrible viewing angles. (Getting a better screen is always why I recommend spending a little more than the bare minimum on a laptop.) It gets between five and six hours of battery life, which isn\u2019t deal-breakingly bad but isn\u2019t exactly impressive either.\nIt has a good, clicky, island-style keyboard that I got used to very quickly, that has a surprising amount of travel and feedback for a device this thin. It also has, much to my sadness and not at all to my surprise, an infuriating trackpad. It recognizes a clicking finger as a swiping finger, and a swiping finger as nothing at all. It works if you\u2019re careful and slow and delicate with it, but the Stream 11\u2019s trackpad was always the thing that slowed me down while I tried to use it. That\u2019s actually still the best reason to buy a Chromebook instead : your $200 might buy you a decent trackpad.\nBad screen, bad trackpad, mediocre battery life \u2013 those are all the standard complaints with Windows laptops, especially cheap ones. The Stream 11 isn\u2019t a new thing, or a different level of thing. It\u2019s just a laptop.\nThat\u2019s the whole point, actually. The Stream 11 is just a laptop. In the history of netbooks, that\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever been able to say. After spending time with this device, I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why you\u2019d spend, say, $500 on a Windows laptop anymore unless you\u2019re desperate for a larger screen. No, the Stream 11 doesn\u2019t play games well, or often even at all, but neither does your average $400 Windows machine. This computer runs Photoshop poorly, as does any other cheap laptop, but it does basically everything else as well as it needs to. I get why you\u2019d spent $800 or $1,000 on a laptop, because it\u2019ll do more or look better, but it seems to me that $200 and $500 now buy basically the same thing in slightly different sizes.\nInexpensive and bad aren't the same thing anymore\nThe Stream 11 is powered like a Chromebook, with an Intel Celeron N2840 processor and 2GB of RAM, and it performs like one. The upside is that it\u2019s quiet and cool, and there\u2019s not even a fan inside. The downside is that it can often be a beat behind as I work \u2014 I click an icon and count \"one mississippi\" before anything starts to happen \u2014 but it\u2019s right in line with what I expect from a $200 computer. More importantly, it\u2019s at least fast enough that I\u2019ve never wanted to heave it out the window onto the pile of netbooks I just couldn\u2019t wait for anymore. It browses the web well enough, plays Netflix movies well enough, and runs Office well enough.\n\"It runs Office.\" That is, in a nutshell, why Microsoft and HP think you might want to buy a Stream 11 over your choice of Chromebooks. It comes with a year of Office 365 (which is itself half the price of the Stream 11), and promises a much more practical kind of productivity for most people. I do most of my work in Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail, but I\u2019m an anomaly; most professionals use Word, Excel, and Outlook. For those people, Office is everything. Just as the Chrome browser is the lifeblood of a Chromebook, its entire purpose and animating principle, so is Office to the Stream 11. This is an Officebook.\nDeciding between a Chromebook and a Windows device like the Stream 11 comes down to how you wish to use it. Chromebooks are primarily single-use devices, just a browser and nothing more \u2014 that\u2019s partly due to bad multitasking controls and offline support, but also to Google\u2019s clear sense of Chrome OS as a simplified kind of workspace. The Stream 11, on the other hand, attempts to do all the same things as laptops hundreds and thousands of dollars more expensive. It just does all those things a little bit worse. Would you rather have a laptop that does a couple of things really well and nothing else? Or a laptop that does a couple of things pretty well and a lot of things badly? There\u2019s no wrong answer, but picking a side makes picking a platform easy.\nThe HP Stream 11 is what Windows netbooks were always meant to be. It\u2019s the most computer, in terms of sheer functionality, that you can buy for $200. It offers to many users all of the apps, services, features, and tools they need to get work done when they\u2019re not sitting at their work or home desktop. It offers all that in a small, affordable package. To many of the people looking at a Chromebook as a way to get email and simple work done on the road, I\u2019d now also tell them to look at the Stream 11.\nI keep coming back to the colors, though. HP didn\u2019t make a blue and pink line of laptops because it\u2019s hoping SVPs will throw them into their Samsonite briefcases and take them into the Delta lounge. It made the Stream 11 for a different kind of user, the one Microsoft doesn\u2019t currently have but hopes to obtain: the students, the young professionals, the people who, like me, use Google Docs and Gmail instead of Word and Outlook.\nThis is a computer for work that's dressed for the weekend\nTo win those users, Microsoft and HP needed to do more. They can\u2019t win by offering the same experience and a few more apps \u2014 many people do everything in a web browser anyway, and that\u2019s easy to get anywhere. The Stream 11 needed to win by offering spectacular battery life, or a killer display, or an insanely thin or beautiful body, or some piece of software or functionality that you can\u2019t replace inside a web browser. The best cheap laptops, and the best Chromebooks, offer at least one of those things. (Let\u2019s not forget, either, that Office Online works just fine on a Chromebook.)\nIf you\u2019re looking for the cheapest viable way to work on Office documents while you fly, you need an Officebook, and the Stream 11 is the only real option. (Just maybe paint it black before you get on the plane.) There\u2019s a market there for Microsoft and HP, but there\u2019s work to do before it can turn a low-end Windows machine back into something everyone wants to buy.\nThe problem with netbooks was never the idea. It\u2019s still the execution.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"HP Stream 11 review: meet the next generation of cheap laptops | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","review","tech"]}
