A recent report by the USDA claims a research lab at the university exposed young baboons to hypothermia and housed the monkeys in unsafe, grime-filled cages.\nThe baboons were \"shivering and clearly distressed.\"\nThe January 25th report, obtained by Bloomberg, found the monkeys had been hosed down with cold water, and their cages contained \"an excessive build up of grime, debris, and excreta on the bars.\" The report also says the lab staff was ill-equipped to care for the 12 baboons, including ones as young as three months old, who were placed under their supervision.\nThis is far from the university's first citation for animal abuse. According to Bloomberg, the institution has been cited for animal abuse 16 times over the course of just two years. In 2013, the USDA reported  OU was euthanizing dogs by electrocution using a 9-volt battery and failing to administer painkillers to dogs about to undergo surgery.\nIn an email statement to Bloomberg, VP of research James Tomasek said, \"The University of Oklahoma takes seriously its obligation to comply with all federal and regulatory standards related to animal welfare.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
