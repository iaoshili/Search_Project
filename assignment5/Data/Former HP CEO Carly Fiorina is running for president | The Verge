{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn two weeks, the 2016 campaign will get its first candidate from the tech industry. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that on May 4th, Carly Fiorina will launch her presidential campaign under the Republican ticket. Fiorina officially entered politics in 2010 with a failed Senate campaign, although she also served as an adviser and central fundraiser for John McCain's presidential campaign in 2008. Fiorina was the CEO of Hewlett-Packard from 1999 to 2005, a tumultuous period during which the company merged with Compaq and struggled with the collapse of the dot-com bubble.\nUnlike many in Silicon Valley, Fiorina has been an outspoken opponent of net neutrality principles , particularly the FCC's recent Title II decision. Fiorina also raised controversy recently by calling the California drought a \"man-made disaster,\" in reference to environmentalists' influence on water use and retention policies. She has also stated that she is personally opposed to abortion, and voted as a citizen to ban gay marriage in California through the state's Proposition 8.\nFiorina has been hiring campaign staff for months , making her candidacy something of an open secret in political circles. Still, it's a major step for Fiorina, who will be entering a crowded field of candidates in the Republican primary, including Scott Walker, Rand Paul, and Jeb Bush. Fiorina is something of a long shot in the race, but will be the only former chief executive running on the Republican side, as well as the only woman. She is scheduled to speak at TechCrunch Disrupt on May 5th, the day after her announcement.\n","Title":"Former HP CEO Carly Fiorina is running for president | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","politics"]}
