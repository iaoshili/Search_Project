{"Main text":"Amazon is hiring drone testing pilots\nAds on the site seek candidates for \"flight operations engineer\" positions\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon announced its plans for delivery drones \u2014  Amazon Prime Air \u2014 late last year. And then, for a long time: nothing. As  observers pointed out , the project had at least a few hurdles to fruition. But the company seems to be making progress: it's posted open jobs for a \" flight operations engineer \" in both Cambridge and in Seattle .\nTwo years ago, Amazon bought UK drone startup Evi Technologies, and it seems the company's expanding R&D work in the Cambridge area. Amazon has been looking to fill positions like \" senior research scientist ,\" but the Cambridge engineer position, posted late last month, sounds more hands-on. Qualifications for the gig include five or more years of \"lead\" flight test experience, and three or more years of \"support\" flight experience. The Seattle job similarly requires five or more years \"of relevant aviation experience, either civilian or military, with either manned or unmanned aviation.\" A slightly less exciting but just as important job for \" flight safety manager \" is also up.\nHere's the full listing for the Cambridge pilot position:\nJob Description\nWe're working on the future.
