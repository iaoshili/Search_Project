{"Main text":"Washington DC is making a taxi app to take on Uber\nThe 'Universal D.C. TaxiApp' will start beta testing in March\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's no secret that some local governments, especially those with robust taxi systems, have been less than welcoming to Uber. The solution, usually, has been to  ban the startup from city borders. But Washington DC's taxi commission might be taking a different strategy: try to compete.\n\"Universal D.C. TaxiApp\" will hail one of 7,000 licensed taxis\nThe capital's taxi commission announced on Friday that it will begin beta testing the \"Universal D.C. TaxiApp\" in March. Riders will be able to hail one of the city's 7,000 licensed taxis if they're in the area, but private services like Uber and Lyft will still be allowed.\nOther cities around the country and the world have been less understanding. The company was banned in  Spain, India, and Thailand this week, after recently winning the right to  operate in Berlin . Whether Uber will use the same  business tactics with the commission as it has with private companies remains to be seen.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
