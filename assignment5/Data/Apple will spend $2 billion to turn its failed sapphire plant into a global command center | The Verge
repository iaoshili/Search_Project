{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple plans to spend $2 billion turning the site of its failed sapphire production plant into a data center. AppleÂ  tells Bloomberg that the site, located in Mesa, Arizona, \"will serve as a command center for our global networks.\" The 1.3 million-square-foot building will be powered entirely by renewable energy and is expected to create 150 full-time jobs and 300 to 500 construction and trade jobs \u2014 far fewer than the 2,000 or so jobs that the sapphire production plant was supposed to make. \"This multibillion-dollar project is one of the largest investments we\u2019ve ever made,\" Apple says.\nApple initially built the plant for GT Advanced Technologies, which Apple forwarded a bunch of money to so that it could start building furnaces and churning out a ton of sapphire. The plant would have been an beautiful cog in Apple's supply chain \u2014 located in the US and able to provide it with enough sapphire to use on displays for many of its gadgets \u2014 but as it turned out, GTAT couldn't actually make that much sapphire, and it quickly filed for bankruptcy. Though that leaves GTAT in a bad spot, Apple seems to have found a way to repurpose its existing investments. With cloud services becoming increasingly important in Apple's software, a new data center certainly can't hurt.\n","Title":"Apple will spend $2 billion to turn its failed sapphire plant into a global command center | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
