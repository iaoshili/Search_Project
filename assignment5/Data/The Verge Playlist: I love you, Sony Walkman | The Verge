{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere are two things I love in this world: breaking news and songs that reference outdated technology. So given  everything Sony-related this week , my playlist therefore had a very simple rule from the onset: every song must reference  the Walkman . That's it.\nMy absolute favorite example was De La Soul's \"Sh.Fe.Mc's\" (featuring A Tribe Called Quest) from the 1994 EP Clear Lake Auditorium: \"I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni.\" Alas, that isn't available on either Spotify nor Rdio ( hello, YouTube ). Everything else is, though, so please enjoy a small sample covering 13 years of Sony-influenced hip-hop.\nBiz Markie - This is Something for the Radio\n\"It sound doo doo extra crazy def on the Walkman\"\nDJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince - The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n\"Put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it\"\nRedman - A Day of Sooperman Lover\n\"Boogying to my Walkman with an 'S' on my chest\"\nThe Pharcyde - Oh Shit\n\"To the next man had my Walkman bumping on the 50 yard line\"\nDe La Soul (ft. A Tribe Called Quest) - Sh.Fe.Mc's\n\"I let my Walkman from Sony play cassettes from Raboni\"\nBeastie Boys - Putting Shame in Your Game\n\"I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on\"\nDel The Funky Homosapien (ft. El-P) - Offspring\n\"I was on the bus the other day, man, trying to listen to my Walkman\"\nDr. Dre (ft. Eminem) - Forgot About Dre\n\"One day I was walking by with a Walkman on when I caught a guy giving me an awkward eye\"\n50 Cent - Hate It Or Love It (G-Unit remix)\n\"Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud\"\nChildish Gambino - Hold You Down\n\"Listening to 'Sky is the Limit' on my Walkman\"\nCommon (ft. John Legend) - The Believer\n\"Real talking, in their ear like a Walkman\"\n","Title":"The Verge Playlist: I love you, Sony Walkman | The Verge","Tags":["culture","the-verge-playlist","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3834807"]}
