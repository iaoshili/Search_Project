{"Main text":"Tech\nSony invents a wearable display to make your glasses smart\nThe SmartEyeglass Attach! aims to be a modular Google Glass for those who already have glasses of their own\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOther than Google, Sony seems to be most bullish about the idea of  putting head-up displays on everyone through the implementation of screen-equipped headsets. Today, the Japanese company reveals its latest experiment in this direction: an OLED microdisplay that attached to a person's glasses and provides relevant information in a \"high-resolution\" 640 x 400 color format. Two additional modules, which are designed to rest atop the wearer's temples, connect up to the microdisplay and provide it with an ARM processor, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, an accelerometer, a touch sensor, and a 400mAh battery. Spec-wise, it's like attaching an Android Wear watch to your glasses.\nLike the Google Glass headset, Sony's new concept will  target sports and business applications first, though the company is keen to \"promote the adoption of wearable devices in new areas,  thereby contributing to the further development of the market.\" Sony wants to begin mass production at some point in the new year and will be showing off its headset at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas early next month \u2014 under the (presumably temporary) title of \"SmartEyeglass Attach!\" The  original SmartEyeglass from Sony, which superimposes information on transparent lenses, is planned to go on sale by the end of March, so Sony will soon have a diversity of awkward-looking choices for people keen to cram more information into their daily lives.\n","Title":"Sony invents a wearable display to make your glasses smart | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech","ces-2015"]}
