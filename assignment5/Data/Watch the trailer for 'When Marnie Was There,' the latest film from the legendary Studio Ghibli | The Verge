{"Main text":"Watch the trailer for 'When Marnie Was There,' the latest film from the legendary Studio Ghibli\nThere's more to this studio than Miyazaki\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRevered animator Hayao Miyazaki may have  bowed out of animation with the  stunning, controversial The Wind Rises , but his Studio Ghibli still has talent to spare. Hiromasa Yonebayashi is one such example; his directorial debut The Secret World of Arrietty was a critical and commercial success, and his latest film When Marnie Was There has just been released in Japan.\nLike Arrietty, When Marnie Was There is an adaptation of a British children's novel, this time by Joan G. Robinson; the plot sees an unwell girl called Anna strike up a friendship with the ethereal Marnie while staying at a seaside town to recuperate. The trailer above is in Japanese, but you don't need to speak the language to grasp many of the Ghibli hallmarks \u2014 like so many of the studio's other works, When Marnie Was There looks to feature the same stunning animation grounded in emotional resonance.\nStudio Ghibli hasn't announced plans for the rest of the world, but if The Wind Rises is any indication, you'll probably have to wait until 2015; that movie got a full release in North America this February after hitting Japanese screens the previous July.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
