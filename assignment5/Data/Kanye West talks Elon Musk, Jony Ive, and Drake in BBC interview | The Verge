{"Main text":"Kanye West talks Elon Musk, Jony Ive, and Drake in BBC interview\n\"The Futch\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTwo years ago, Kanye West sat down with BBC Radio 1 host and  new Apple employee Zane Lowe for one of his  greatest interviews ever . This week he  did it again , and it is a cacophony of Kanye quotes, newly abbreviated words, and tears. (Kanye breaks down while discussing his relationship with famed design professor Louise Wilson, who passed last year.) Kanye talks about his relationship with Adidas, his upcoming album and a potential  tour with Rihanna , how he implored President Obama to sit down with Elon Musk, and what he and Musk discuss when they get together (\"The Futch\"). It's quintessential Kanye, and it's a must-watch. Here's a taste of what to expect:\n\"I think innovation gets too much credit, in a way.\"\nWhen asked about the sound of his new album: \"It's a joyful noise unto the lord.\"\n\"Meeting Paul McCartney is like meeting Ralph Lauren. It's like whoa! The greatest of their field, period. Of all time.\"\nWhat Kanye said to President Obama: \"I would suggest you sit with Elon Musk.\"\nKanye on Jony Ive: \"He said that 'people are so concerned with being first as opposed to being better.'\"\n\"I believe that the world can only be saved through design.\"\n\"Art is to be free. Design is to fix.\"\nKanye's advice to Drake: \"Run. Fly. Go as fast as you can. Don't stop.\"\n","Title":"Kanye West talks Elon Musk, Jony Ive, and Drake in BBC interview | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
