{"Main text":"Netflix doesn't own its shows, but that could change soon\nOwnership benefits Netflix in the long run\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMost people would find it surprising that Netflix doesn't own House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black. But going forward, Netflix is making ownership of shows a priority. In an interview with Bloomberg Business , Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the streaming service will own a large number of the 20 or more shows that will launch on the service next year. \"We\u2019ve continued to expand our creative role on the shows,\" Hastings told Bloomberg Business. \"Now we\u2019re taking on ownership and production.\"\nIt's a shrewd move for a company who by all indications will be going head to head with HBO for the foreseeable future. While Netflix has grown to near parity with premium cable and network channels when production companies are choosing a home for a TV show, there's always the possibility it could be outbid, even for shows deeply tied to its identity like House of Cards. Ownership takes care of that issue, and will give Netflix additional revenue streams like DVD sales and licensing rights. While Hastings didn't reveal which shows Netflix had purchased, Bloomberg Business says it has acquired Flaked, an upcoming comedy starring Will Arnett.\nVox Video: Netflix's original series Daredevil has received universal praise\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
