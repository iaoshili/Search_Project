{"Main text":"The United Launch Alliance's new rocket will be called Vulcan\nPrivate space companies are competing hard for the spotlight\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhile SpaceX was preparing for what ended up being a scrubbed Falcon 9 launch , the United Launch Alliance (ULA) tried to steal a little spotlight by announcing the winning name in its rocket-naming contest. The new rocket will be built by Boeing and Lockheed Martin \u2014 the two partner companies that make up the ULA \u2014 and it will be called Vulcan.\n\u2014 ULA (@ulalaunch) April 13, 2015\nThe online competition ran for almost a month, and people were able to vote as much as they liked. Vulcan won out over options like Eagle, Freedom, GalaxyOne, and Zeus, even though it was added a few days after the contest began.\nUp until now the ULA has been using older rockets like the Altas V or the Delta IV heavy, which it used to launch the first Orion capsule test. This will be the company's first proprietary rocket, and will be another option for companies looking to get to low-earth orbit.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
