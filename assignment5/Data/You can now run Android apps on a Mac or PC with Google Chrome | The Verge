{"Main text":"Next\nARC is based on Android 4.4, meaning a lot of standalone apps are immediately compatible. Twitter works well, and Facebook Messenger loads just fine but does continuously say it\u2019s waiting for the network. I was impressed with Flipboard, and the ability to flick through using two finger gestures on a trackpad, and even Instagram works well for casual browsing. Of course, trying to use the camera in apps will immediate force the app to crash, and keyboard commands aren\u2019t always recognized properly. The biggest issue is that most apps are simply designed for touch, or in the case of games to use a phone\u2019s accelerometer.\nI tried a variety of games, and while simple titles like Candy Crush Soda work very well, others refused to launch properly or couldn\u2019t handle mouse input correctly. That\u2019s not surprising for apps that aren\u2019t even optimized, and it\u2019s clear Google\u2019s project has a bright future. While Microsoft is building out  Windows 10 and the idea of universal apps across PCs, phones, tablets, and the Xbox One, Google is turning Android into its own universal app platform. Google already built a way to  push Chrome OS straight into Windows 8 , and this latest Android experiment brings Google even closer to a PC market dominated by Microsoft. Developers can now run their Android apps on phones, tablets, PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, and even Linux-powered devices, and that\u2019s a big opportunity that will likely result in a lot of these apps arriving in the Chrome Web Store in the near future.\nUpdate April 3rd, 6AM: article amended to note you can add multiple apps.\n","Title":"You can now run Android apps on a Mac or PC with Google Chrome | The Verge","Tags":["apple","microsoft","google","tech"]}
