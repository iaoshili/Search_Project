{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA sequel to Blade Runner has been in the works for a few years now, but it appears that Ridley Scott no longer plans to direct it. In  comments to Variety , Scott is reported to have said that he will be producing, but not directing, the sequel to Blade Runner, unlike what's been planned up until now. The change of course is likely due to the full plate of films that Scott has been lining up. In addition to the Blade Runner sequel, he was also working on a Prometheus sequel and an adaptation of the novel The Martian.\nScott says that the new Blade Runner should start filming within the next year, according to Variety. He also gave some of the first details on what the movie will be about. Scott reportedly says that Harrison Ford has signed on to reprise his role from the original film, but Ford will apparently only factor into the end of the film. \"Harrison is very much part of this one, but really it\u2019s about finding him,\" Scott tells Variety. \"He comes in in the third act.\" Scott also says that the script makes sense in the way that it relates to the original.  He's previously called it \"damn good.\" There's no word on who might replace him as director.\n","Title":"Ridley Scott won't direct 'Blade Runner' sequel | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
