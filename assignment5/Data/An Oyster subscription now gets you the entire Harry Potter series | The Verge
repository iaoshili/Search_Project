Rowling titles\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEbook subscription service Oyster just increased its value in the witchcraft and wizardry community: the company has added the entire Harry Potter series to its library. The app, which offers users a buffet of books for a flat monthly fee, will add all seven Harry Potter novels, plus J.K. Rowling's faux-nonfiction titles, Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard to its catalog.\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Mollusk\nTo carry the titles, Oyster teamed up with  Pottermore , the all-things-Potter web portal. Earlier this month, Oyster's ebook count hit 1 million thanks to a  partnership with the publishing giant Macmillan .\nOyster's partnership with Macmillan covered only the publishing house's back catalog. Harry Potter is dated (the final book in the series came out in 2007), and the original series is already available on Kindle Unlimited, but a boost right now couldn't hurt. In October, Rowling announced 2001's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would be  released as a three-part film series beginning in 2016.\nLast year,  Oyster co-founder Willem van Lancker told us the company's goal was to foster \"a deeper sense of community around books.\" With Harry Potter, that work has already been done for Oyster \u2014 the franchise comes with its own built-in community.\n","Title":"An Oyster subscription now gets you the entire Harry Potter series | The Verge","Tags":["apps","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
