{"Main text":"Is this Android's new logo?\nBloomingdale's would be proud\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAndroid's  current wordmark , set in a futuristic typeface, has remained basically unchanged for as long as the platform has existed \u2014 but now, some 5 1\/2 years after the  T-Mobile G1's commercial release, it might be time for an update. Posted earlier this week by Twitter account  @upleaks , the alleged 17-second boot animation for LG's upcoming  G Watch features the usual stylings of a Google-influenced Android device \u2014 but the interesting part comes at the end, when an all-new Android word mark appears. It's entirely in lowercase and has a softer, friendlier feel than the robotic futurism of the current logo \u2014 the only questions are whether it's real, and if so, whether it'll be canon for all Android branding going forward.\nDuring its brief ownership of Motorola, Google oversaw a revamp of that company's longstanding word mark  to take on a rounder, more approachable look , so a facelift for Android's branding wouldn't be without precedent. The new Android logo \u2014 if it's real \u2014 bears a slight resemblance to the  well-known branding of the Bloomingdale's department store chain . That's almost certainly unintentional, but regardless, subliminally associating Android in consumers' minds with a high-end retailer might not be a bad idea: Google is in the midst of launching  Android Wear , a platform that could spawn a number of high-end smartwatches that wouldn't look out of place in a jewelers' showcase.\nWe've reached out to Google for comment.\n","Title":"Is this Android's new logo? | The Verge","Tags":["google","design","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5286837"]}
