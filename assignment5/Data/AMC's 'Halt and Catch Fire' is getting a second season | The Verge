{"Main text":"AMC's 'Halt and Catch Fire' is getting a second season\nThe struggling drama will have another chance to find an audience\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUntil recently, prospects weren't good for AMC's  Halt and Catch Fire . The drama, about a group of misfits attempting to clone IBM computer technology in the 1980s, saw a dip in ratings, and renewal wasn't certain. But it appears AMC is willing to gamble on the series: the show has been renewed for a second season.\nHalt and Catch Fire averaged 1.2 million viewers\n\"We have a history of demonstrating patience through the early seasons of new shows, betting on talent and building audience over time. We see that opportunity here and look forward to a second season,\" AMC president Charlie Collier said in  a statement .\nHalt and Catch Fire averaged 1.2 million viewers over the course of its first season, which you might compare to the 1.8 million average of last year's Low Winter Sun, an AMC series that was ignominiously canceled after one season. Critics, however, have been  more charitable to HACF, and, anecdotally at least, it's picked up a more dedicated fan base. There may still be time for it to blossom in popularity.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
