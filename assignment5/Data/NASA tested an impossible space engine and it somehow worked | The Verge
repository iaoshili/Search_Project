Earlier this week at a conference in Cleveland, Ohio, scientists with NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories in Houston, Texas,  presented a paper indicating they had achieved a small amount of thrust from a container that had no traditional fuels, only microwaves, bouncing around inside it. If the results can be replicated reliably and scaled up \u2014 and that's a big \"if,\" since NASA only produced them on a very small scale over a two-day period \u2014 they could ultimately result in ultra-light weight, ultra fast spacecraft that could carry humans to Mars in weeks instead of months, and to the nearest star system outside our own ( Proxima Centurai ) in just about 30 years.\nThe type of container NASA tested was based on a model for a new space engine that doesn't use weighty liquid propellant or nuclear reactors, called a  Cannae Drive . The idea is that microwaves bouncing from end-to-end of a specially designed, unevenly-shaped container can create a difference in radiation pressure, causing thrust to be exerted toward the larger end of the container. A similar type of technology called an EmDrive has been demonstrated to work in small scale trials by  Chinese and  Argentine scientists.\nWhile the amount of thrust generated in these NASA's tests was lower than previous trials \u2014 between 30 and 50 micronewtons, way less than even the weight of an iPhone, as  Nova points out \u2014 the fact that any thrust whatsoever is generated without an onboard source of fuel seems to violate the  conservation of momentum , a bedrock in the laws of physics.\n\"not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon.\"\nMost impressively, the NASA team specifically built two Cannae Drives, including one that was designed to fail, and instead it worked. As the scientists write in their paper abstract: \"thrust was observed on both test articles, even though one of the test articles was designed with the expectation that it would not produce thrust.\" That suggests the drive is \"producing a force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon,\" the scientists write. It may instead be interacting with the quantum vacuum \u2014 the lowest energetic state possible \u2014 but the scientists don't have much evidence to support this idea yet.\nThere are many reasons to be skeptical: the inventor of the Cannae Drive, Guido Fetta, has  only a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Chemical Engineering and is operating his company Cannae as a for-profit venture. Still, the fact that such results were produced by NASA scientists is promising and should warrant further investigation.\n","Title":"NASA tested an impossible space engine and it somehow worked | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
