{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe distinctive look of the Mini Cooper hatchback isn't easily distilled into other body types \u2014 the Mini Coupe, Roadster, and Countryman are living proof of that. But Milan-based coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring has teamed up with Mini's design team to build a truly spectacular one-off, electric-powered concept roadster that somehow manages to meld the classic British design with sleek Italian looks. The so-called Mini Touring Superleggera Vision will almost certainly never see the roads in this form, but that doesn't mean you can't fall in love with the design.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe concept is built in the patented superleggera style \u2014 Italian for \"superlight.\" A lightweight steel tube frame is covered with hand-pounded sheets of aluminum for an ultra-light design.\nThe front of the concept holds most of the Mini design legacy \u2014 a large grille and perky, circular headlights are evocative of Minis of old.\nDespite that big, classic Mini grille, this concept is an EV.\nBut it's clear from just about any other angle that this is a very different Mini. Like most true superleggeras, the rear extends far back.\nAnd there's a wild \u201950s-style fin on the boot that manages to work together with the half-retro, half-futuristic design.\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature are the LED taillights, which \u2014 yes \u2014 are a split Union Jack.\nThe taillights aren't nearly as kitschy as one might expect \u2014 they're so deftly executed that the rear looks as classic as an Aston Martin.\nSuperleggeras are all about saving weight. As Louis de Fabribeckers, Head of Design at Carrozzeria Touring says, \"In this car all unnecessary equipment or decoration is sacrificed, as performance is gained through lightness and efficiency of the bodywork and interior.\"\nThe design employs massive, hand-pounded sheets of aluminum that are placed onto a lightweight tubular steel frame.\nMinimal Italian design dominates the interior \u2014 the dash is one single piece of unpainted aluminum.\nThough the designers couldn't help but bring back Mini's classic circular center dial.\nThe three-spoke steering wheel is far more elegant than those found on a typical Mini.\nCarrozzeria Touring and BMW-owned Mini revealed the stunning concept this weekend at Concours d'Elegance at Italy's idyllic Villa d'Este near Rome.\nWhile a handmade beauty like this will never see production, we hope Mini makes good use of those truly wonderful taillights in a production car.\n","Title":"This handmade Italian roadster is a Mini Cooper unlike any other | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
