{"Main text":"39 Comments\nIn just a matter of hours, 150,000 rabid comics fans of all stripes will descend on San Diego for Comic-Con 2014. It\u2019s the mecca of all things nerdy for the summer, where some of the biggest names in geek culture and entertainment come to show off what\u2019s to come for the next few years. This year\u2019s event is a bit different, though: with movies like the new Star Wars and Avengers coming out, 2015 and 2016 already promise to be the biggest years in film history, and Comic-Con could very well be Ground Zero for a pop culture singularity.\nWe\u2019ve put together a primer for what to expect for this year\u2019s mega-event. There\u2019s plenty that\u2019s already been announced, but there may well be a few surprises that could steal the whole show. The madness starts tonight and runs all the way through Sunday. Make sure you\u2019re ready.\nThe big stories\nMarvel: Not only does Marvel have a few huge movies right around the corner, it has a whole lot more in the works \u2014 and there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019ll learn what they are during its panel on Saturday. Expect to hear plenty about  Avengers: Age of Ultron and  Guardians of the Galaxy , and potentially some details on six of Marvel\u2019s upcoming films, including  Doctor Strange and Captain America 3.\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies will conclude the second epic Middle Earth trilogy this December, and Peter Jackson will be on hand in San Diego this week to get everyone excited one last time. It\u2019s about time that we all get a look at the next film, and that certainly isn\u2019t out of the question given that Hobbit footage has been previewed at Comic-Con before.\nMad Max: Fury Road: George Miller is bringing his classic dystopian action series back after 30 years, and Warner Bros. is promising that he\u2019ll show off a first look at it this Saturday. With Miller still in the directing chair and  Tom Hardy taking over as Max , Fury Road is definitely one to look out for.\nGame of Thrones: The HBO juggernaut recently ended its fourth season, probably its biggest yet. The cast and crew will be at Comic-Con this year answering questions about where the series will go next. Also, series author George R.R. Martin will be around to deal with rabid readers anxious for his next installment.\nDC Comics TV: If Marvel will rule the box office, DC will own TV this fall. Expect plenty of news and impressions for highly anticipated shows  Constantine ,  The Flash , and  Gotham , along with updates on what\u2019s in store in the next season of Arrow.\nFight Club 2: Chuck Palahniuk\u2019s cult hit is  returning with a sequel 15 years after David Fincher turned it into a wildly successful film. The sequel will be a 10-issue graphic novel written by Palahniuk, and Palahniuk will be in San Diego on Saturday to talk about it and the original Fight Club with Fincher and this new book\u2019s illustrator.\nCommunity lives to stream again. But what about that movie?\nShow stealers\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For: We\u2019ve already seen  plenty of trailers for the new Sin City , but the film is coming to Comic-Con intending to make a splash: there will be a display of its classic cars and a panel with directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller.\nJupiter Ascending: After having its release date pushed way back at the last minute, there\u2019s good reason to be concerned about whether  Jupiter Ascending is any good. But with the Wachowski's coming off of their breathtaking Cloud Atlas, we\u2019re certainly still eager to see more of what looks to be another absolutely epic film.\nOutlander: Any time Battlestar Galactica creator Ronald D. Moore wants to show up with a new series, count us ready to watch.  Outlander promises to be a total epic , spanning time and genres, and we\u2019re more than ready to get a first look at it this Friday.\nCommunity: It\u2019s pretty much always been on the brink of cancellation, but Community truly escaped near-certain death last month when Yahoo announced that it would be picking the show up for a short sixth season after it was cancelled by NBC. With a cult following and a huge fan demand for a movie, it'll be interesting to hear what series creator Dan Harmon has to say about the show's future later this week.\nTusk: Kevin Smith is keeping the details of his next film fairly secretive, but he\u2019s finally ready to unveil its trailer this week at Comic-Con. Is it a horror film? Is it a comedy? We\u2019re not really sure. Tusk has something to do with a podcast host, a spooky forest, and a monster, and that\u2019ll certainly be a fun combination in Smith\u2019s hands.\nCould steal the show... if they show up\nStar Wars: Episode VII: Star Wars is currently in the midst of serious filming, so J.J. Abrams and his crew aren\u2019t expected to show up. However, considering how much he loves pulling things out of his mystery box for the sake of the fans ( just look at the recent X-Wing news ), maybe a cast member or two could make a surprise appearance.\nBatman v. Superman: Zack Snyder\u2019s superhero epic could blow the show away if it makes an appearance. Beyond Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck in the titular roles, the likes of Gal Gadot and Jesse Eisenberg have already been cast as Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor, respectively, along with rumors of  Jason Momoa appearing as Aquaman . Even Hercules star  Dwayne Johnson hinted at working with DC to play a character that can \"throw down\" with Superman. All told, this could be huge.\nInterstellar: Director Christopher Nolan is coming off the incredible blockbuster that was The Dark Knight Rises with  Interstellar, a sci-fi film that has a character venturing into space and through a wormhole in order to save the earth . It\u2019s due out this November, making chances good that it\u2019ll show up this week as a Comic-Con surprise.\nJurassic World: The Jurassic Park series hasn\u2019t had much going for it since Steven Spielberg\u2019s original movie back in 1993, but all of that could change with next year\u2019s Jurassic World.  Details on the movie have largely been kept under wraps , so Comic-Con might be the perfect place for it to finally roar and generate some big buzz.\nFantastic Four: Fantastic Four is another comic series with a bad history at the movies, but its upcoming reboot may finally have the right elements \u2014  namely, a strong director and a strong cast \u2014 to make it all come together just right. The film\u2019s already been shooting, and Comic-Con would be a great place for it try to win over jaded fans and make some new ones.\nWe're not expecting to see cast members from 'Episode VII' in Hall H, But you never know\nWe'd also love to see\nWarcraft: With Moon director Duncan Jones at the helm, there\u2019s good reason to pay attention to the film adaptation of Blizzard\u2019s classic video game series. Warcraft has already finished shooting, and  though it may not come out until 2016 , this is going to be a big one worth building buzz for.\nChappie: District 9 director  Neill Blomkamp will return next year with Chappie , the story of an intelligent robot that\u2019s kidnapped a pair of gangsters, both played by members of the eccentric rap group Die Antwoord. That description is enough to sell us on the movie; now we\u2019d just love to see some of it.\nFast & Furious 7: After the sudden death of Paul Walker, Fast fans are certainly hoping that the long-running series\u2019 seventh entry will give him a proper send off. Oh, and that the movie will be  just as wild as everything that came before it . We could just find out what that\u2019ll look like soon.\nTomorrowland: Coming in part from Lost showrunner Damon Lindelof, it should be no surprise that the  details of Tomorrowland have remained mysterious . What we know is that the movie is a sci-fi adventure and that it\u2019s being directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles). Altogether, that\u2019s a lot to like.\nTerminator: Genesis: There\u2019s a new trilogy of Terminator films on the way , and with Schwarzenegger back on board, we can\u2019t wait to see how the first one looks. We don\u2019t expect to see Genesis show up at Comic-Con, but the movie ought to make a big splash if it does turn up.\nThe Hunger Games: Lionsgate Entertainment announced early on that The Hunger Games won\u2019t have much of a presence at this year\u2019s Con. That\u2019s a shame, since Mockingjay Part I already looks like it\u2019ll raise the bar set high by last year\u2019s Catching Fire.  Summit will, however, debut the new trailer on Samsung Galaxy Tablets during the event. Which strikes us as silly, but what can you do?\nDon't forget about\nStar Wars Rebels: Even though Star Wars proper isn\u2019t expected to make an appearance,  Disney XD\u2019s new series Star Wars Rebels is coming out in a big way. The new series is set in the years after the rise of the Galactic Empire but before the original trilogy. So expect to see more Storm Troopers, evil Force adepts, and even a Cowboy Jedi before they\u2019re through.\nRobot Chicken: Robot Chicken has for years now blended raunchy humor with an eye for pop culture. (Just consider everything they\u2019ve done with Star Wars and just about every \u201880s cartoon you can think of). This year they\u2019re coming back to show off just how far they can push the envelope.\nThe Walking Dead: It may be going on its fifth season, but The Walking Dead still knows how to make a splash at Comic-Con. The cast will be on hand in San Diego this week to discuss what fans can expect from the fifth season, and we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see them tease a first look at it there either.\nSharknado 2: The Second One: Sharknado surprised everyone last summer by briefly taking over the internet. This year,  the shlock returns with a sequel , and Syfy is doubling down on it with a whole week of shark content. It\u2019s truly bizarre \u2014 but in a fun way \u2014 and we\u2019re interested to see what they bring to San Diego this year.\nThe Giver: Philip Noyce's adaptation of this classic dystopian novel is due out in just a few short weeks, so it's only naturally it make an appearance this year. Jeff Bridges is already a sci-fi mainstay, but star Brenton Thwaites put in a solid performance in this year's The Signal. We're looking forward to this panel.\nEverything else you'll see\nCosplay is not for the faint of heart\nDiverse characters: Comics companies \u2014 and Marvel especially \u2014 have been pushing hard on the diversity front. In the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen a  female Thor and a  black Captain America . We also saw  the death of a beloved character in Archie Andrews , who was killed protecting a friend who happened to be gay. These decisions will almost certainly make waves on the convention floor.\nToys: The splashiest parts of Comic-Con may be previews of movies and TV shows, but outside of that is a world of fandom. That world includes tons and tons of cool, exclusive, and intricate toys that you can expect to see popping up across the web throughout the week.\nCostumes: Comic-Con sees an absolutely massive turnout of fans each year, and that makes it the perfect venue for cosplayers to  show off some of their most impressive outfits . Expect to see photos of the amazing, the absurd, and the unexpected outfits of Comic-Con fans once they hit the floor later this week.\nPanels: On top of the major studio panels and Q&As, there\u2019s a panel for just about everything at SDCC, from Adventure Time fan meetups to seminars on how to self-publish your own comics. And it\u2019s sometimes the hidden gems that have the most worthwhile surprises.\n","Title":"The 31 biggest things to look for at Comic-Con 2014 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","sdcc-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5695384"]}
