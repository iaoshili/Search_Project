{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you want a smartphone to match your lux lifestyle, you can't settle for the same old iPhone as everyone else. You need something unique to show off just how special you are. That's where the 88 Tauri from Tonino Lamborghini comes in. Only 1,947 of these Android smartphones will be made, so you can be sure you won't run into someone on the street with the same device. And, yes, it does cost $6,000, but it ups your masculinity quotient by at least 50 percent thanks to all of those leather finishes and angular slabs of steel. It also takes \"the most luxurious selfie in the world,\" whatever that means.\nThose interested in picking up the 88 Tauri should be aware that, despite the raging bull logo and typeface, Tonino Lamborghini is not the same as the supercar company. The fashion brand is named after the son of Ferruccio Lamborghini, the founder of the legendary car brand. And, not that the specifications matter, but the 88 Tauri has a 5-inch, 1920 x 1080 display, a 2.3GHz, quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storageÂ  according to Russian site Hi-Tech Mail . So don't let outward appearances fool you \u2014 there's nothing special on the inside. It'll go on sale later this month.\n","Title":"This $6,000 'Lamborghini' smartphone will make you feel special | The Verge","Tags":["tech"]}
