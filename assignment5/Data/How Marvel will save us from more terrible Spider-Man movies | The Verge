{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony has one of the greatest comic book superheroes of all time, and it was screwing everything up .\nLast year's Amazing Spider-Man 2 wasn't a box office disaster, but it made notably less money than any of Sony's other Spider-Man films. Critically, it was a mess. And this was supposed to be the film that would kick off its own series of interconnected sequels and spinoffs.\nEnter Marvel, the company that birthed Spider-Man. Last night, the two studios announced a collaboration that ostensibly brings the web slinger into Marvel\u2019s ultra-successful, highly interconnected film universe for the very first time \u2014 all the while Sony gets to revitalize its franchise with help from someone who knows how to make a superhero movie that's does well with both critics and the box office.\nOn paper, it feels like an obvious win-win for everyone involved, but it\u2019s impossible to understate just how surprising this deal is \u2014 and what it means for Marvel going forward.\nHow Spidey Got Here\nSo why does Sony, not Marvel, own the film rights to one of Marvel's biggest characters?  This is where things get a bit confusing, so before we dive in, here's a fancy chart to help:\n(Image via The Geek Twins )\nBack in the '90s, before Marvel Studios became the juggernaut it is today, the company sold the exclusive movie rights to a number of its biggest comic book characters to other studios. Up until now, Spider-Man could fight alongside Captain America in pages, but on screen, those two properties were worlds apart.\nIt's been a jumbled mess , but over the years Marvel Studios has managed to get some of its characters back (see: Blade, Daredevil, Black Panther). The biggest holdout is 20th Century Fox, which owns X-Men, the Fantastic Four, the term \"mutant,\" and all related characters including Deadpool. (The only overlaps, due to some story weirdness, are Quiksilver and the Scarlet Witch.) Don't expect these universes to collide, however: Fox has fared much better with its Marvel superhero film rights, especially after the not-quite-reboot that was  Bryan Singer's X-Men: Days of Future Past , which ended up being both a critical and commercial success.\nWhat happens now?\nNeither Sony nor Marvel is explicitly calling this a reboot, but it's clear that's what \"new creative direction\" means. It's also a necessity for this deal to work. Marvel Studios\u2019 films all exist in the same interconnected universe. The consequences of one film affect all of them \u2014 for example, every film after The Avengers had to acknowledge that in 2012, New York got pretty messed up by alien soldiers and flying worm... things. The studio is notorious for its control of the overarching narrative, now spanning more than 20 films from 2008\u2019s Iron Man through at least 2019\u2019s Inhumans \u2014 with more sure to be announced. The Spider-Man stories that Sony has told thus far don\u2019t fit that world at all, so when Spidey enters the Marvel Cinematic Universe, be it his flagship film or a cameo elsewhere, he presumably won\u2019t have any of that past baggage.\nSome of the more interesting emails leaked during the Sony Pictures hack actually centered around  Marvel wanting to use Spider-Man . Then-co-chair Amy Pascal and President Doug Belgrad had discussed a scenario where Marvel would produce a new Spider-Man trilogy for which Sony would retain \"creative control, marketing and distribution.\" It struck us as very odd at the time for all the reasons mentioned above, but sure enough, \"final creative control\" was a key line in last night\u2019s press release. What that ultimately means is open to interpretation. It could be as little as Sony nodding their head to whatever ideas Marvel actually does. Yeah, that\u2019s probably what it means.\nGet ready for Civil War\nThe big question now is, when do we actually get to see Spider-Man \u2014 and who will play him? According to those aforementioned leaked Sony Pictures emails, Marvel Studios wanted him for Captain America: Civil War, which is scheduled to hit theaters on May 6th, 2016.\nMarvel's upcoming films\nGet ready for a very, very, busy few years :\n2015\nAvengers: Age of Ultron: May 1st\nAnt-Man: July 17th\nCaptain America: Civil War: May 6th\nDoctor Strange: November 4th\nGuardians of the Galaxy 2: May 5th\nSpider-Man: July 28th\n","Title":"How Marvel will save us from more terrible Spider-Man movies | The Verge","Tags":["culture","report","entertainment"]}
