{"Main text":"SpaceX releases dramatic pictures and video of failed Falcon 9 landing\nVideo from barge shows how close the rocket came to landing safely\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has shared the first images from last week's failed Falcon 9 barge landing. Musk tweeted the still frames taken from cameras onboard the drone ship to Doom creator and Oculus VR CTO John Carmack,  saying : \"It's kinda begging to be released\u2026\" Shortly after Musk tweeted out the photos, SpaceX followed up with  an incredible Vine of the botched landing. (Don't forget to turn on the audio.)\nMusk described the crash as a \"Full RUD\" or \"rapid unscheduled disassembly.\"\nMusk described the attempted rocket landing last weekend as \" close, but no cigar \" \u2014 but this assessment doesn't really do these images justice. The 14-story-tall Falcon 9 rocket is seen hitting the deck of the barge at a 45-degree angle as the four  stabilizing fins lose hydraulic power. The engines then fire in an attempt to restore balance but it's too late and the rocket smashes into the deck of the ship. The four images tweeted by Musk can be seen below, who cheerfully sums up the situation: \"Full RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event. Ship is fine minor repairs . Exciting day!\"\n@ID_AA_Carmack Before impact, fins lose power and go hardover.

Simply getting the rocket to the barge \u2014  a 300 feet by 100 feet target \u2014 was a big challenge and we can see that the company definitely managed that.\nIf the stabilizing fins work as intended in the future, then Musk might certainly achieve his historic goal: creating multi-use rockets that will make spaceflight dramatically cheaper. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level,\" Musk said in October  during a talk at MIT . Despite the explosion, these image show just how close SpaceX is.\n","Title":"SpaceX releases dramatic pictures and video of failed Falcon 9 landing | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
