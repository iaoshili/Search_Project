It's a role he's played several times before both literally ( Iron Man ) and somewhat figuratively (Iron Man 3).\nBut director James Gunn originally had something entirely different in mind \u2014 Stan Lee in a cage, as part of the Collector's museum, maybe flipping off Groot. Gunn filmed the scene with a double in the UK (pictured) and would've filmed \/ digitally replace with Lee later (\"not quite as difficult as it sounds\"). But it was not meant to be. Here's an excerpt  from his Instagram post :\nA couple of the guys at Marvel thought Stan Lee in a case was too broad of a joke in general, and that it took the audience out of the movie. I argued about it for a bit, but we ended up not keeping it in the film. In a pretty typical case of Internet-journalism-telephone, articles online yesterday said that Disney forbade the scene because of standards. However, that's incorrect \u2014 no one at Disney ever even saw the scene, and it was cut solely for creative reasons.\nIt would've given  Howard the Duck someone to talk to.\n","Title":"This was supposed to be Stan Lee's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' cameo | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
