{"Main text":"Samsung predicts 30 percent drop in profit\nCan the Galaxy S6 turn things around?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung Electronics has released earnings guidance for its first quarter of 2015, and the story's the same as the last few: the company's making good money, but less than before. Samsung predicts it made around 5.9 trillion won ($5.4 billion) in operating profit between January and March off about 47 trillion won in revenue ($43.2 billion). That represents around a 30 percent drop in profit and a 12 percent slide in sales from the same period a year ago.\nSamsung hasn't offered any further information or explanation for the falling numbers, but it's heading into a crucial quarter with the imminent release of the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge \u2014 the company's most impressive phones in years . If the S6 duo can outperform its disappointing predecessor, the Galaxy S5, it could help turn Samsung's sales slump around.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
