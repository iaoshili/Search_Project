As The Wall Street Journal reports , officials on Wednesday confirmed 59 cases of the disease in California, of which 42 have been linked to the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. So far, five Disneyland employees have been diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious disease that typically begins with a high fever, runny nose, and bloodshot eyes, before leading to a red rash. An additional eight related cases have been identified in Colorado, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Mexico.\n\"We can expect to see many more cases of this preventable disease unless people take measures to prevent it.\"\nThe US declared measles  eliminated in 2000, but cases have recently risen at alarming rates, as parents have  misguidedly opted to not vaccinate their children against the disease.

Experts fear that increased vaccination exemption rates could lead to further outbreaks in California, where the anti-vaccine movement has gained troubling traction in some areas.\n\"We can expect to see many more cases of this preventable disease unless people take measures to prevent it,\" Dr. Gilberto F.
