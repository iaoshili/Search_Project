It would affect the skyline. And it would be noisier and there would be a greater probability of something falling on your head. Those are not good things.\"\n\"Those are not good things.\"\nStill, he acknowledged, a sky full of flying Teslas would have its advantages: \"On the other hand, you'd be able to go from one place to another faster,\" he said. Musk said we could see similar same gains in travel speed through easier methods, namely eliminating traffic \"choke points\" and constructing giant systems of underground tunnels.\nMusk traced his sci-fi ambitions to an underlying desire for adventures \u2014 something that also explains his desire to travel on Mars, he said. \"It would just be the greatest adventure ever,\" he said. \"And we need things in life that are exciting and inspiring. It can't just be about solving some awful problem. There have to be reasons to get up in the morning.\"\n","Title":"Elon Musk just made a pretty good case against flying cars | The Verge","Tags":["tech","transportation"]}
