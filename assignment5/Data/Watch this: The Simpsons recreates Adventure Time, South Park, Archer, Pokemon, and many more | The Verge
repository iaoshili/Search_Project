{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSaxophone enthusiast Lisa Simpson closed last night's Treehouse of Horror episode with this terribly meta thought:\n\"I just had a worrisome thought. If there could be two incarnations of The Simpsons why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others?\"\nAnd so we get this wonderful montage care of \"some evil marketing entity,\" wherein various incarnations of The Simpsons family inspired by various cartoons from around pop culture all descending upon the house.\nThe cameo-fest starts with 3D Simpsons (possibly a nod to Pixar, given Homer is voiced by the animation studio's go-to actor John Ratzenberger) and a medley of nods to Japanese anime:\nHomer as Roronoa Zoro \/ \"Pirate Hunter Zoro\" from One Piece\nMarge as Rangiku Matsumoto from Bleach\nBart as Naruto, Maggie as Pikachu from Pokemon\nLisa as Mikasa from Attack on Titan\nSanta's Little Helper as Shenron from Dragon Ball Z the dragon form of Haku from Spirited Away\nAnd then come the rest of the multiverse:\nAdventure Time (in this world, Princess Bubblegum does end up with the Ice King)\nSouth Park (Maggie is Canadian)\nArcher (Sterling is looking a bit... older... in this incarnation)\nThe work of Sylvain Chomet (Triplets of Belleville) who previously didÂ  this couch gag\nLego\nDespicable Me (as Gru's minions, sans Gru)\nThe Island of Dr. Hibbert from \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\"\nThank you everyone in comments and emails for helping us fill in the gaps!\n","Title":"Watch this: The Simpsons recreates Adventure Time, South Park, Archer, Pokemon, and many more | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","watch-this","entertainment"]}
