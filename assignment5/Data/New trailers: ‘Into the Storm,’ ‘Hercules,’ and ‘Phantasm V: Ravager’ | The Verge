{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's been a big week for movie trailers. We've seen new clips for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , X-Men: Days of Future Past , and Jupiter Ascending \u2014 and there\u2019s still more to watch. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\n'Into the Storm'\nWe\u2019ve seen the found footage format used for horror movies and sci-fi movies, and now it\u2019s time for disaster movies. Sarah Wayne Callies (The Walking Dead) and an ensemble cast face off against some of the nastiest weather conditions this side of Twister. Do yourself a favor: do not watch this trailer before getting on an airplane.\n'Hercules'\nIf you\u2019ve been waiting for the director of Rush Hour 3 to team up with The Rock for a reboot of Hercules\u2026 well, this is your lucky day. In this teaser trailer Dwayne Johnson has a really weird beard, wears a lion head for a hat, and swings his club at giant animals. Then to top it all off, he screams his name really loud.\n'Phantasm V: Ravager'\nDon Coscarelli kicked off his cult horror franchise 35 years ago, and while there hasn\u2019t been an entry since 1998 that\u2019s about to change. Animation veteran David Hartman takes over directing duties this time around, having previously worked with Coscarelli on Bubba Ho-Tep. Plot details are thin, but longtime fans can rest easy: Angus Scrimm will be back as the horrific Tall Man.\n'Romancing the Stone'\nThis trailer to Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1984 action comedy may not technically be new, but we haven't seen it in quite some time. The clip harkens back to a simpler time, when actors like Danny DeVito would shoot special sequences full of exposition just for a movie trailer \u2014 and then break the fourth wall for no reason whatsoever. Who\u2019s this Ira person he\u2019s shouting at? You\u2019ll have to watch the movie to find out.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018Into the Storm,\u2019 \u2018Hercules,\u2019 and \u2018Phantasm V: Ravager\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
