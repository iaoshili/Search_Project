{"Main text":"Memory in the fleshA radical 1950s scientist suggested memories could survive outside the brain \u2014 and he may have been right\nBy Arielle Duhaime-Ross\nThe bomb was the size of a shoebox. The brown paper packaging that enveloped it was standard for US mail at the time, and its contents provided no indication \u2014 no ticking clock, no lit fuse, no clicking sound \u2014 of the explosion to come. Resting on the kitchen counter that separated Dr. James V. McConnell from his graduate student assistant, Nicklaus Suino, it awakened no suspicions. Even the bomb\u2019s trigger was subtle: all it took was for Suino to reach across the counter and touch the clear fiber tape that held it together.\nMcConnell was the target of the Unabomber\u2019s 10th bomb\nDespite their proximity to the explosion, both McConnell and Suino survived. The young graduate student suffered minor injuries and was kept at the local hospital overnight; McConnell experienced mild hearing loss. \"It was quite traumatic at the time,\" Suino recalls. \"Dr. McConnell and I both developed shock reactions to loud noises afterward.\"\nMcConnell was the target of Theodore \"the Unabomber\" Kaczynski\u2019s 10th bomb. Why would Kaczynski, a man obsessed by a quest to rid the world of threats from modern technology and science, go after a psychology professor at a Michigan university?\nSome thought it had to do with a prediction McConnell had made in the \u201870s, when he suggested that prisoners would one day be conditioned out of anti-social behavior . But McConnell was also famous for something else: in the \u201850s and \u201860s, McConnell had performed a series of memory experiments at the University of Michigan while Kaczynski was a student there \u2014 experiments that earned him a reputation as a kooky, arrogant, and deeply misguided academic who challenged everything we think we know about memory. McConnell\u2019s radical research suggested that memories could exist outside the brain \u2014 and even be transferred between organisms. The conclusions were so outlandish and dystopian that some speculated they attracted Kaczynski\u2019s ire .\nBut James McConnell may have been right.\nThe flatworms used in Michael Levin's lab, Dugesia japonica\nMcConnell\u2019s experiments have largely faded from scientific memory \u2014 those that remember him tend to use him as a cautionary tale. But at the end of the \u201850s, McConnell was a big deal: his charismatic personality, combined with his controversial scientific accomplishments, landed him on TV more than once, notably on The Steve Allen Show. Instead of dazzling audiences with complicated science, McConnell captivated them with awe-inspiring concepts. In fact, the experiment that brought him his first taste of national fame was remarkably simple.\nIn a 1959 study, McConnell sought to demonstrate that memories could be stored in cells outside the brain. To do so, he enlisted the help of the common freshwater flatworm, Dugesia dorotocephala.\nDr. James V. McConnell\nFlatworms were ideal because, like mammals and unlike, say, jellyfish, they have a centralized brain. They also have an exceptional ability to regenerate themselves from tiny morsels of flesh: sever the tip of a flatworm\u2019s tail, and within 14 days you\u2019ll have an entirely new specimen, fully equipped with a brand new brain. Moreover, flatworms can be taught to perform certain behaviors. Researchers can use electrical shocks to teach them to respond to lighting cues by moving to a particular part of a petri dish. That is, flatworms can be trained to remember a behavior and perform it on cue.\nIf McConnell demonstrated that the lowly flatworm could recall its training after its head had been cut off, and its brain had grown anew, the experiment would show that memories could live outside the brain.\n\"We didn\u2019t know what the tail would remember, if anything, for it had to grow an entirely new brain, new eyes, and almost an entire new nervous system,\" McConnell wrote in a 1965 collection of science-related articles entitled The Worm Re-Turns. But, according to McConnell\u2019s study, they did remember. The regenerated worms were able to recall the behaviors they had learned to execute under certain lighting conditions. \"The tail regenerates,\" McConnell wrote, and \"showed as good a memory of the original task as did the heads.\"\nPublished in the Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, a highly regarded psychology journal, the study earned McConnell a lot of press, with mentions in Time, Medical World News, Newsweek, and Fortune. \"Almost at once the mail began to come in asking for details,\" McConnell wrote.\n\"We didn\u2019t know what the tail would remember, if anything\"\nBut the fantastic takeaway of McConnell\u2019s study \u2014 that cells other than neurons could store information \u2014 caused many to question the study\u2019s methodology and conclusions. In 1960, he published a second experiment, one that pushed his theories far beyond what anyone would have imagined. This one left the scientific community completely stumped.\nWidely known as \"the cannibalism experiment,\" the study tested another McConnell theory: that memory could be transferred chemically from one flatworm to another through something called \"memory-RNA.\" Memory-RNA, McConnell suggested, was a special form of RNA \u2014 the intermediary form of genetic information that fills the gap between DNA and proteins \u2014 that could store long-term memories outside the brain. His method was unorthodox, to say the least: McConnell fed bits of trained flatworms to their untrained brethren. As a result, McConnell claimed, the untrained flatworms performed behaviors that the trained flatworms had previously learned. In short, the dead flatworms\u2019 memories had found a new home.\nThe inside cover of The Worm Re-Turns, featuring a crest McConnell designed. The \"SR\" stand for stimulus-response and the Latin is said to roughly translates to, \"When I am done explaining this, you will understand even less.\"\n\"Biologists and chemists said \u2018no way,\u2019\" recalls Reeva Kimble, who did undergraduate research for McConnell in 1959 and 1960. Reeva later married Daniel Kimble, the student who gathered data for McConnell\u2019s first regeneration experiment. McConnell\u2019s opponents couldn\u2019t make sense of his findings. For them, \"there was no mechanism to understand his result, so it had to be hogwash,\" Reeva says.\nMcConnell\u2019s cannibalism experiment was greeted with intense skepticism. Groups of researchers at competing universities did their best to replicate his study in order to disprove his work; if the study couldn\u2019t be replicated, it would be enough to expunge his ideas from scientific memory.\nSome researchers reported obtaining similar results when recreating McConnell\u2019s study, but many didn\u2019t. Others (rightly) faulted him for his small sample size and because the effect he reported was, albeit significant, relatively weak. Still, replicating work in which a human observes animal behavior precisely and manually is extremely difficult, and McConnell\u2019s conclusion was never fully debunked.\nFor his part, McConnell insisted that other scientists failed to reproduce his findings because no one was able to fully recreate the conditions of his experiment. Eventually, however, the psychologist\u2019s work was cast aside, or referred to as \"a failure.\"\nMcConnell\u2019s hobbies didn\u2019t do much to strengthen his scientific credibility. He liked writing, science and humor, so he combined them in The Worm Runner\u2019s Digest \u2014 a \"scientific journal\" that he used to reach the masses following the publication of his 1959 flatworm study. The journal contained real studies, but they were featured alongside poems, cartoons, and humorous takes on scientific research penned by colleagues and students. As a result, outsiders complained that they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the scientific subject matter and its more humorous content.\n\"We\u2019ve insisted that the Digest be a mixture of fact and fun, for it seems to me that anyone who takes himself, or his work, too seriously is in a perilous state of mental health,\" McConnell wrote in 1965, in a compilation of the Digest\u2019s articles. This attitude made him popular among his students, but failed to inspire confidence among his peers.\n\"He was very frustrated with people not taking him seriously,\" Suino remembered during a conversation in 2013. McConnell was disappointed with the dismantling of his memory work, he said. \"I think that he felt that a lot of people who went into his research with a bias against it.\"\nTwo-headed flatworms grown in Levin's Lab. Video courtesy of Junji Morokuma\nWhy were McConnell\u2019s ideas so unsettling? What he was proposing \u2014 the existence of a chemical memory trace that encodes training information in flatworms \u2014 is nothing short of astounding. Supposing that McConnell was correct, it would mean that the flatworm brain is capable of storing information in chemical structures which can be transferred to other parts of the body. Moreover, these chemical structures could form a \"language\" for memories that can cater to an infinite number of situations \u2014 and that other organisms can \"read.\"\nThe chemical transfer theory goes against current and past conceptions of memory. Aristotle, for example, likened memory to a wax tablet in the mind upon which a person imprints knowledge and recollection as time goes by. The impact of that explanation has been profound and long-lasting; many point to it as the source of the \"young, impressionable mind\" trope.\nScience has since moved on from the wax tablet analogy, of course. Currently, biologists believe that information is stored in neural networks in the brain, in the connections that allow information to be transmitted from one neuron to the next. That\u2019s as far as most researchers are willing to go when discussing the underpinnings of memory, however. Press a scientist to tell you how memories are encoded and decoded in the brain, and you\u2019ll soon find that the scientific community doesn\u2019t have an answer. How do our brains represent memories like seeing X-rays for the first time? The question is so difficult to tackle that many researchers have chosen to focus on determining what sorts of modifications take place in the brain when memory is stored instead \u2014 changes in neuron structure, for example \u2014 in the hopes that they might reverse-engineer memory formation.\nBut looking at modifications in the brain isn\u2019t the same as figuring out how memory is encoded, or where it's stored. Whoever finds the vault where we keep our memories is bound to go down in history.\nGraduate student Moran Neuhof assists with flatworm research in one of Michael Levin's labs\nMichael Levin doesn\u2019t recall the first time he encountered McConnell\u2019s 1959 memory study, but he remembers his reaction to it. \"I came across a primary paper of McConnell showing that memory can survive regeneration, and I thought, \u2018Well this is extremely profound because it really speaks to the ability of all tissues \u2014 those outside the head anyway \u2014 to store memories.\u2019\"\nLevin figured out how to grow a working eye on a tadpole's tail and back\nLevin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, is well known for his work on limb regeneration; his studies have been featured in the Journal of Neuroscience and on the cover of Cell. One of his most well-known experiments demonstrated that it\u2019s possible to trigger limb growth in young frogs by giving them a drug cocktail. He\u2019s also recognized for figuring out how to grow a working tadpole eye in a location other than the head \u2014 namely on the tail and back. \"He\u2019s really well-known in the field of amphibian regeneration,\" says Alejandro Sanchez Alvarado, a developmental biologist at Stowers Institute for Medical Research. \"I don\u2019t know of anybody doing work remotely similar to what Mike is doing.\"\nBut a few years ago, Levin took on a side project. After stumbling upon McConnell\u2019s work, he decided to take the basic principles behind the psychologist\u2019s first memory experiment and try it out for himself. After all, there were already vast amounts of literature on aneural organisms \u2014 organisms that don\u2019t have a brain to begin with \u2014 that can learn, so he thought McConnell might have been at least partially right. \"Everything from plants, to slime molds, to single-cell organisms can learn, even sperm can learn to run mazes,\" Levin says. But unlike those creatures, flatworms possess a \"true brain\" \u2014 a centralized nervous system located in their triangle-shaped heads. This makes them a lot more like humans than most of us are willing to admit.\nIt took four years and over a million dollars to recreate and improve upon McConnell\u2019s experiment. In an effort to sidestep the criticism his predecessor faced, Levin developed a rigorously documented, replicable experimentation method. Part of that was done by the invention of a machine, called the \"Automatic Training Apparatus,\" that could train and track the movements of multiple flatworms without human intervention.\nThe \"Automatic Training Apparatus\"\nLate last year, I traveled to Medford, Massachusetts \u2014 just outside Boston \u2014 to visit Levin in his lab at Tufts University. Simpsons figurines, mugs, and blankets dot his office; a three-eyed plastic fish watches over him from the bookshelf. Word got around one day that the researcher liked the show. Now the toys just keep coming in; the students think it\u2019s funny.\nEventually, Levin took me to a small room a few doors from his office to see the \"Automatic Training Apparatus.\" There, I watched Moran Neuhof, a visiting student from Israel, put 12 petri dishes \u2014 each filled with a flatworm \u2014 into Levin\u2019s machine. Pointing to a computer screen, Neuhof told me to observe an image of a worm as it moved inside a petri dish. Red targets tracked the worms as they swam around; an invisible grid helped translate their movement into time-stamped coordinates along the way. This is how Levin was able to objectively train the worms and record their behaviors, without ever having to be in the same room.\nDesigning the Automatic Training Apparatus \"was a nightmare,\" Levin says. Flatworms are tiny and quick, and they love to hang off the sides of a petri dish instead of swimming at the bottom \u2014 all of which makes them tough to track with a camera. The researcher collaborated with several engineering firms to make an apparatus capable of simultaneously, and autonomously, tracking and recording the movements of 12 worms. Minimizing human participation was critical \u2014 a fully automated process was meant to protect Levin\u2019s results from the scrutiny McConnell faced. \"If you don\u2019t believe me, you can take the tracking data and the Quicktime movies,\" Levin says. \"Analyze it yourself, and see what you think of whether they behaved correctly or not.\"\nThen, Levin and his team cut off their heads\nThe training protocol Levin devised is simple, but elegant:\nFlatworms are cautious and like to explore their environment, so when they\u2019re introduced to food in a new location, they tend to circle it for a long time before feeding, Levin says. This means that scientists can use \"latency of feeding\" \u2014 the time the worms take to approach a food item \u2014 as an indication of how well they remember a specific environment. If they remember that the environment is secure, or that it only contains one source of food, then they don\u2019t need to explore it; they can go straight for the food. So, Levin trained them to recognise the textured petri dishes. Once the worms learned to recognize the rough floors of the dish, they started going for the food more quickly. Then, Levin and his team cut off their heads.\nTwo weeks later, the researchers re-introduced the worms, now armed with new heads, into the dish, but only for a short period of of time. This shortened re-introduction is meant to signal to the brain that the memory stored in the flatworm\u2019s trunk is still relevant, Levin says. The next day, the worms were finally re-tested. \"Worms that had never before associated the roughness with the liver, took a long time to approach the food, and worms that had been trained went straight for the liver \u2014 that\u2019s the difference,\" Levin says.\nFlatworms swim in a petri dish as observed and recorded by Michael Levin's Automatic Training Apparatus\nThe Tufts University researcher has yet to establish a mechanism to explain his findings , which he published in the Journal of Experimental Biology in 2013. He hypothesizes that memories could spread beyond the brain thanks to electrical charges generated by cells in the rest of the body. But until more research is conducted, it\u2019s hard to know what to make of his results.\nOther mechanisms have been suggested. Eva Jablonka, a developmental biologist who studies the evolution of nervous systems at Tel Aviv University, thinks that small RNAs might be involved. Small RNAs are short copies of DNA that aren\u2019t translated into proteins. When the flatworm learns a behavior, the brain chemistry changes, and it\u2019s possible these changes alter small RNAs, Jablonka says. Because these molecules can migrate between cells, altered small RNAs could end up in stems cells that remain in the decapitated worm. When the worm\u2019s head grows back, the small RNAs migrate back to the head, changing the brain\u2019s chemistry and allowing it to learn certain behaviors more quickly. If true, the memory that Levin thinks is stored outside the brain wouldn\u2019t be memory at all. Rather, the small RNAs would allow the flatworms to recover a brain \"environment\" that helps them learn a specific behavior more quickly. But this scenario, Jablonka says, \"is still imaginary.\"\nIt\u2019s still possible that, like McConnell\u2019s work, Levin\u2019s study is flawed in some unidentified way\nAt this point, any attempt to explain Levin\u2019s results is problematic. The truth is that we don\u2019t know if Levin\u2019s conclusions are even remotely correct. It\u2019s still possible that, like McConnell\u2019s work, Levin\u2019s study is flawed in some unidentified way. It\u2019s also possible that the flatworm\u2019s unique regenerative abilities lie behind its ability to recall memories after growing a new brain. In that case, flatworms may be the only species with a central nervous system that can store memories outside of the brain. \"I find that highly unlikely,\" Levin says, \"but it\u2019s a possibility.\"\nEven if storing memory outside of the brain is universal among animals, that storage method might only work for simple pieces of information. Complex memories like the significance of the word \"truth\" or \"caring\" might not have a place beyond the brain. But if there is a small chance that the experiment is reproducible, and that this isn\u2019t a trait reserved to some tiny insignificant worm, the impact could be revolutionary.\n\"I think [this work] will start a renaissance in human memory,\" says Oné Pagán, a planarian expert and pharmacologist at West Chester University. \"Levin is one of the top researchers in developmental biology, so if anybody can pull it off, he can.\"\nComplex memories like the significance of the word \"truth\" or \"caring\" might not have a place beyond the brain\nLevin\u2019s work could completely alter the way we think of memory, with real-world applications, Pagán says. The new flatworm studies could one day lead to novel Alzheimer\u2019s disease treatments. In neurodegenerative diseases, \"there\u2019s a certain destruction of cellular structures that deal with memory,\" he says. So, \"if memory is stored outside the actual brain, that opens the door for people to potentially fully or partially recover those memories\" following stem cell therapies, for instance.\nStudies of flatworm memory recall could also give rise to new architectures for storing data and biological memories in computers. If information can be stored in many different types of cells, for example, then creating a robotic prosthetic with parts that can perform as computational devices \u2014 independently from others \u2014 might be within reach. Machines would be more robust, because a glitch in their central processors wouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to a complete loss of function; other \"smart\" parts could pick up the slack, and maybe even help the robot fix itself.\nFinally, Levin\u2019s findings could one day help researchers activate limb regeneration and wound-healing in humans. \"Let\u2019s say that you lost a big part of your liver,\" Jablonka says \u2014 \"if we were able to introduce the kinds of molecules that will help your body regenerate this liver, that would be a great thing!\"\nMichael Levin in his Tufts University lab\nAs with McConnell, the mass media has demonstrated intense interest in Levin\u2019s study, with articles appearing in Scientific American , National Geographic, NPR, Wired UK, and here at The Verge , to name a few. \"The worms\u2019 memories were just as accurate as those worms who had never lost their heads,\" explained Carrie Arnold at National Geographic . \"So these worms grew new heads with old memories, a remarkable finding,\" wrote Robert Krulwich at NPR . Levin\u2019s study showed that \"it\u2019s clear the action is happening somewhere outside of the brain,\" exclaimed Wired UK\u2019s Liat Clark.\nBut the scientific community\u2019s reaction to a revival of McConnell\u2019s work has been mixed.\n\"I think it\u2019s a fine piece of work,\" Alvarado says. \"The data that [Levin] obtained seems like a reasonable consequence of his manipulation.\" Jablonka also thinks Levin\u2019s methodology is sound. \"He automatized the experiment so they can follow a lot of animals at once,\" she says. \"Michael is a very original scientist.\" \"Levin\u2019s [study] was done in such an exquisite way,\" Pagán says. \"With appropriate controls and no human bias.\" And Scott Rawls, a pharmacologist who works with flatworms at Temple University in Philadelphia, agrees. \"From a mechanistic perspective, I think he covered the bases and did the experiment pretty well.\"\nThe internal engineering of the Automatic Training Apparatus\nOthers are less enthusiastic. \"The paper from Tufts might be right, but they still haven\u2019t quite done the experiment in a way that really convinces you,\" says Robert Kentridge, a psychologist at Durham University in the UK. What Levin has yet to do is show that the transfer is memory-specific, he says. \"The effect of stress could have the same consequences as learning.\" What Levin might have picked up on is behavior induced by a stress hormone, itself triggered by the texturized petri dishes Levin used. A superior experiment would have eliminated that possibility by training flatworms to also recognize an un-textured petri dish, he says. \"That would have shown that what\u2019s being transferred is quite specific and has nothing to do with a dish that might be \u2018stressful.\u2019\"\nKentridge isn\u2019t alone in thinking that the study could have been better designed. Noelle L\u2019etoile, a cellular biologist and nematode researcher at UC-San Francisco, says that Levin should have studied more variables and other forms of stimuli. The fact that the training protocol relied on a textured petri dish might have contributed to the results in ways that we don\u2019t yet understand, she says. The rough surface could have altered the neuron circuits that allow the worm to move, which would in turn help the worm get around more easily inside a petri dish. Those altered circuits might also become more efficient after training, she ventures.\nIt\u2019s crucial that other groups of researchers tackle this study, L\u2019etoile says. Levin should give his machine, or the design for his machine, to other groups to see if they can reproduce the findings. If they can show that Levin\u2019s results don\u2019t stem from a series of flukes, it would \"go a long way to support his contention that he has found something,\" she says.\nL\u2019etoile readily admits that McConnell\u2019s failures continue to loom large over Levin\u2019s study. It\u2019s a \"cautionary tale in the field of experimental biology\" \u2014 one that comes with \"a lot of baggage,\" she says. The fact that so many research groups had trouble replicating flatworm training protocols in the \u201860s and \u201870s means that the bar to convince her has been set very high, she says. \"I think I have a great deal of skepticism about [flatworm] training.\"\nGraduate student Moran Neuhof places a bit of organic beef liver in a petri dish for flatworm experiments\nFive years after the Unabomber attack, at the age of 64, James McConnell suffered a heart attack, and passed away. An obituary printed in The New York Times mentioned both his controversial experiments and the Worm Runner\u2019s Digest, which the author said \"often needled his colleagues.\"\nNeither Suino nor the Kimbles attended James McConnell\u2019s funeral, but his friends and colleagues remember him still. \"He was the person who convinced me to go to graduate school,\" Reeva Kimble says. Despite the criticism he faced, McConnell\u2019s showmanship and larger-than-life ideas resonated with his students. He was the researcher who showed them that science could be light-hearted and fun. He was also the researcher who didn\u2019t back down when he was challenged for making outlandish claims.\nMcConnell (left) with friends Reeva and Daniel Kimble. All wear sweatshirts emblazoned with McConnell's crest\n\"I think what [McConnell] was right about is that one should pay attention to these unusual things on the fringes of science that can disrupt the current way of thinking,\" Levin says.\nMcConnell\u2019s ideas were set aside, seemingly forgotten, for half a century. That\u2019s not unique; scientific ideas are regularly abandoned, in favor of more sensible, simple proposals. But science has demonstrated more than once that what humans perceive as being \"simple\" isn\u2019t always biologically simple. Our ideas are partly informed by culture \u2014 a culture that, in this case, believes firmly in the brain as the center of our physiological and psychological universe. This is undoubtedly correct. But it might not be the whole story.\nLike dormant memories, James McConnell\u2019s ideas have resurfaced. What science does with them now will depend on Levin and his peers, as they try to prove that the results are wrong \u2014 in a counter-intuitive effort to show that maybe McConnell was right. Should they succeed in poking holes in Levin\u2019s study, McConnell and his flatworms will likely remain a cautionary tale. But if they fail, James McConnell will be remembered, forever, as a pioneer.\n","Title":"Memory in the Flesh | The Verge","Tags":["features","science","longform"]}
