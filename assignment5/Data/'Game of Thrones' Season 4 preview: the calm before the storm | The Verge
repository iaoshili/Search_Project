{"Main text":"70 Comments\nBe forewarned: there are some serious season three spoilers ahead.\nWhen HBO\u2019s hit series Game of Thrones first premiered, there was one moment that fans of the long-running book series had been waiting to see play out, and last season they got it. For the uninitiated, the so-called Red Wedding killed off several main characters that had been around since the show\u2019s inception \u2014 and did so in spectacularly brutal fashion. The bloodbath totaled less than five minutes of screen time, but it resonated because of Game of Thrones\u2019 modus operandi: giving audiences a long slow build before unleashing gut-wrenching fury. The plotting, the witticisms \u2014 yes, even the gratuitous amounts of nudity and violence \u2014 represent hours of investment into major characters, so when they eventually meet their less-than-noble deaths, you feel it.\nSo now that Game of Thrones is returning on HBO this Sunday, there\u2019s really just one question to ask: how much more devastating can things get?\nAfter three years on the air, the adaptation of George R.R. Martin\u2019s saga has racked up more characters and storylines than any sane person can keep track of. So before we dive into what\u2019s to come, let\u2019s take an all-too-brief look back at how we left Westeros last season.\nTHE LANNISTERS\nThe cruelest family in the land is now back together in King\u2019s Landing. Patriarch Tywin Lannister is maintaining a firm grasp on power by serving as advisor to his sadistic grandson King Joffrey. The family misfit Tyrion Lannister \u2014 played to perfection by Peter Dinklage \u2014 has been sidelined and forced to marry Joffrey\u2019s ex-fiance Sansa Stark, although he\u2019s done that to protect her from the king\u2019s violent tendencies more than anything else.\nTHE STARKS\nOnce the presumptive heroes of the show, the Stark clan has been largely wiped out, and those remaining are scattered around Westeros. Stark daughter Arya is riding off to parts unknown with her brutal captor, known as The Hound. Bran \u2014 who was paralyzed by Jamie Lannister at the very start of the show \u2014 is heading north with a ragtag group, including his protector Hodor. Bran\u2019s prophetic dreams and mystical powers appear to be growing more intense.\nJON SNOW AND THE NIGHT'S WATCH\nJon Snow, Bran\u2019s bastard half-brother, has managed to escape from the free-roaming gypsies known as the \"wildlings.\" He\u2019s returned to the great wall that separates the unexplored northern lands of Westeros from the various kingdoms. Meanwhile, his friend Samwell has alerted the Night\u2019s Watch \u2014 a band of fighters stationed at the wall \u2014 that the mystical zombies they call White Walkers have returned.\nSTANNIS AND MELISANDRE\nStannis Baratheon, who up until this point had been waging a war to become the king of Westeros himself, is convinced to focus on the coming threat of the White Walkers. The person doing the convincing is his advisor, the witch Melisandre \u2014 but the limits of her powers aren\u2019t entirely clear.\nDaenerys Targaryen\nDaenerys Targaryen, also known as the \"mother of dragons,\" has her own claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros. She continues to reside on a completely different continent as the rest of the characters, where she is slowly amassing the resources needed to take her rightful place by force. She now has an army of former slaves and three rapidly growing dragons at her side \u2014 and seems prepared to do anything to take the throne.\nThere are plenty of new conflicts to go around\nAs it has in years past, the new season\u2019s premiere dives right in, jumping between as many of those narrative threads as it can in an hour\u2019s time. While it brings all the fan favorites to the forefront, the focus is on slow, expository scenes of debate and reflection. It\u2019s all set-up, lining up the alliances and conflicts we\u2019ll see play out in the season ahead, and there\u2019s plenty of both to go around. Reunited with his sister and incestuous lover, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) senses something is wrong right from the start. \"You come back with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same,\" his sister tells him, and she\u2019s right. Jaime\u2019s changed over the years \u2014 for a man that started out so evil, he\u2019s actually somewhat likeable now \u2014 and throughout the episode we see him coming to grips with the fact that he can\u2019t return to his old comfort zone.\nComplicating matters further for the Lannisters is the appearance of a new character, Oberyn Martell (a smirking Pedro Pascal). He\u2019s introduced in the most Thrones-ian way possible: two parts sex, one part random violence. He\u2019s a menacing foil for Tyrion, and makes it clear in no uncertain terms that he carries great ill will towards the entire Lannister family.\nBut while the Lannisters are learning that a legacy of treachery has its downsides, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss seem to be laying the groundwork for the remaining Stark children to come into their own. Jon Snow, returning to Night\u2019s Watch, has a level of confidence that we haven\u2019t seen from him in quite some time. And Maisie Williams shines yet again as young Arya Stark. We\u2019ve slowly seen Arya change as her formative years were defined by murder and betrayal, but here she takes a brutal step down a path that she may never be able to come back from again.\nA childhood of lies and murder has changed Arya Stark\nThe first two seasons of Thrones were one-to-one adaptations of specific books, but when it came time for the third novel, A Storm of Swords, Benioff and Weiss tackled just the first half of the story last season. Season four represents the completion of that tale, so fans who have read the book have a pretty good idea of the shocks ahead. One event in particular, the chronology of which has been slightly rearranged for the television adaptation, is expected very early in the season \u2014 and will assuredly change the course of the story in ways that Sunday\u2019s premiere doesn\u2019t even hint at.\nWill this new season bring another watershed moment like the Red Wedding? Even those who knew that massacre was coming were devastated by seeing it actually come to pass, but Game of Thrones has never lived on plot twists alone; spoilers for every season have been available in paperback for over a decade. Where the show has always thrived is fleshing out the world and all its facets (this is the series that inspired the neologism \"sexposition,\" after all). The premiere of season four is, if anything, the calm before the storm. It\u2019s indulgent, both in its pacing and content \u2014 and love it or hate it, that\u2019s Game of Thrones in its purest form.\nThe new season of Game of Thrones premieres this Sunday night.
