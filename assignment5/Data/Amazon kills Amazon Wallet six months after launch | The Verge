{"Main text":"Amazon kills Amazon Wallet six months after launch\nAmazon has exited the mobile payments race, but is leaving the door open for a potential return\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon Wallet is officially dead. According to  CNET , the company began informing users last night that it would be shuttering its mobile payments app today, removing it from Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. The app allowed users to upload gift, loyalty, and membership cards, but not credit or debit cards. While Amazon officially launched the app in beta, it did pre-load it on to its Fire Phone. Current users will still be able to use cards previously loaded on to Amazon Wallet, but balances will not be updated after today, leaving it up to users to track how much they've spent. \"We\u2019ve learned a great deal from the Amazon Wallet beta program and will look for ways to apply these lessons in the future as we continue to innovate on behalf of our customers.\" Amazon spokesman Tom Cook said in a statement to The Verge.\nAmazon hasn't said whether it will get back into the mobile payments game in the near future, but the space is heating up, with or without the online retail giant. With Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and whatever Samsung invariably announces in the coming months, it's looking like everyone will be paying for something with their phone very soon.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
