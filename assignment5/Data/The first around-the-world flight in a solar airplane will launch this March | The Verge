{"Main text":"The first around-the-world flight in a solar airplane will launch this March\nBertrand Piccard and André Borschberg will pilot the Solar Impulse 2 on a 21,748-mile flight\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn around two months, the team behind the solar-powered aircraft Solar Impulse 2 will attempt the first ever around-the-world flight powered only by sunlight. After  unveiling the Solar Impulse 2 last April , the Solar Impulse team announced today a timeline and route for the flight, which will launch in late February or early March.\nAfter taking off in Abu Dhabi, the Solar Impulse 2 will make stops in Oman, India, Myanmar, China, the US, and Southern Europe or North Africa before landing back in Abu Dhabi sometime in August.\n17,248 solar cells power four 17.4-horsepower electric motors\nBut it won't be easy. The Solar Impulse 2 has a 236-foot wingspan covered in 17,248 solar cells that power four 17.4-horsepower electric motors, but altogether it weighs just 5,000 pounds \u2014 less than an adult hippopotamus. The single-pilot cockpit is unheated and unpressurized, which means it will be more than a little uncomfortable for Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, the team who will share piloting duties on the multi-leg journey.\nPiccard and Borschberg have been with Solar Impluse from the beginning (Piccard is the president of Solar Impulse and Borschberg is the co-founder and CEO), and hold eight world records for flight, including the first  solar-powered flight across the US in 2013 in the  original Solar Impulse .\nThe Solar Impulse 2's across-the-world flight should clock 500 hours total flight time and around 21,748 miles.\n","Title":"The first around-the-world flight in a solar airplane will launch this March | The Verge","Tags":["tech","transportation"]}
