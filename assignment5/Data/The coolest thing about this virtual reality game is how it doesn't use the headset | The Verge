{"Main text":"The coolest thing about this virtual reality game is how it doesn't use the headset\nTick, tick, boom!\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe best virtual reality game I played at the Game Developers Conference \u2014 which has been devoted largely to VR \u2014 made smart use of a traditional three-ring binder, a pen, and some loose paper.\nKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes is the first game from Steel Crate Games. The bomb-defusing puzzle game is designed for two players and one VR headset. The person wearing the headset sees the virtual bomb and, using a controller, has the ability to snip, press, turn, and tap the explosive's various components. The person without the headset can't see the bomb, but has a real notebook \u2014 or a PDF file \u2014 that provides directions for defusing these particular bombs based on their appearance.\nFor example, if a bomb has five wires, and one wire is yellow, and the serial number on the side ends in an odd number, then the bomb defuser should snip the fourth wire. Â The VR player must communicate a bombs look, and the notebook player must instruct the defusing process. As the players cooperate, a red timer counts down. If time runs out, boom!\nThe small team and their game came together a little over a year ago at a Global Game Jam. They hope to release the game in an early format soon.\n","Title":"The coolest thing about this virtual reality game is how it doesn't use the headset | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","tldr","videos","entertainment","gdc-2015"]}
