{"Main text":"This is the $79 accessory that replaces all the MacBook ports\nGet your wallet ready\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple is  ditching all of its traditional MacBook ports for a single USB Type-C connector in its new 12-inch MacBook. It's a smaller reversible connector, and it's not compatible with existing full-size USB accessories. If you want to charge, use a monitor, and use a USB device all at the same time, then you'll need a $79 accessory. There are two options: VGA or HDMI; they're both $79 and sold separately from the  base $1,299 price of the new MacBook .\nThose who just want to use a USB accessory and not charge at the same time can opt for a $19 USB to USB Type-C adapter. Be prepared to get your wallet out for these new accessories if you want your new MacBook to be useful once you unbox it, though. Sadly, there's no adapter for those who need ethernet connectivity or SD cards, so you'll need to use USB to USB Type-C for both. If you simply want a spare power connector for a new MacBook then you'll need to pay $78, that's  $29 for a 2-meter cable and $49 for the actual power block . Yes, they're both sold separately.\nVerge Video from CES 2015: This is the reversible USB plug of your future\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
