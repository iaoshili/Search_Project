The Intercept has published The National Counterterrorism Center's Watchlisting Guidance report from March of 2013, distributed throughout the intelligence community as a roadmap to how the government tracks suspected terrorists and their associates.\nAnyone with \"a possible nexus\" to terrorism can be added\nThe report is unclassified, but its secrecy has been fiercely guarded before now, and the Attorney General has said that its disclosure \"could cause significant harm to national security.\" It does not appear that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden was involved in the leak; the article credits the document simply to \"a source within the intelligence community.\"\nAppearing on the watchlist can have serious consequences \u2014 individuals can be prevented from traveling or enthusiastically prosecuted for minor offenses \u2014 but the standard for placing someone on the list is much less rigorous than conventional law enforcement. The immediate family of suspected terrorists may be watchlisted without any additional suspicion, along with associates and anyone with \"a possible nexus\" to terrorism. Through a \"threat-based expedited upgrade,\" a White House official can also temporarily elevate entire categories of people onto the no-fly or selectee lists for as long as a month, a loophole that skirts the traditional standard of reasonable suspicion.\n","Title":"This is how the US government classifies people as terrorists | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","national-security"]}
