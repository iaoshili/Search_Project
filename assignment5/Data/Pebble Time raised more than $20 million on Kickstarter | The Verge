{"Main text":"Pebble Time raised more than $20 million on Kickstarter\nThat's a lot of watches\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe knew Pebble's recent Kickstarter endeavor was doing well. Earlier this month the Pebble Time became the  most successful Kickstarter product ever when it passed the $13.4 million mark. Now, the funding period is over and Pebble Time has  raised a total of $20,338,986 from 78,471 backers. The initial goal was $500,000.\nA hard record to beat\nThe original Pebble smartwatch was also launched through Kickstarter in 2012, and it remains the third most-funded project in Kickstarter's history. But because Pebble now has more than 100 employees and  almost $26 million in outside funding , the Time's Kickstarter always seemed to be more about hype than money. Almost as soon as it launched, the Pebble Time had already broken a Kickstarter record by surpassing the  $1 million mark in just 49 minutes .\nSo, $20 million isn't really a surprise, but it sure is a lot of money. The watches are scheduled to begin shipping in May.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
