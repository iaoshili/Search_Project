{"Main text":"Action Comics #1\nSuperman\u2019s first appearance, of course, was on the pages of 'Action Comics.' The first 14-page issue was released on May 31st, 1938, and it presented a version of Superman\u2019s origin story that isn\u2019t all that different from the tragic history that\u2019s usually presented today.\nFleischer Studios Superman Cartoons\nIt didn\u2019t take very long before Superman headed to the screen. Fleischer Studios began making animated Superman shorts that ran in theaters between 1941 and 1942, and they\u2019re famous for coining the character\u2019s phrase, \u201CThis looks like a job for Superman!\u201D The shorts are now in the public domain and available to watch on YouTube.\nSuperman and the Mole Men\nA decade later, in 1951, a live-action Superman finally came to the big screen for a feature-length film. Though a color shot of George Reeves\u2019 Superman accompanied the poster, the film itself was in black and white \u2014 perhaps explaining the outfit\u2019s two-tone style.\nAdventures of Superman\nReeves went on to play Superman in the \u2018Adventures of Superman\u2019 TV series, which was spun off of the film and began airing the very next year. By the show\u2019s third season, it had started to film in color too, presenting a better look at Reeves\u2019 outfit. At this point though, the outfit looks more comfortable than heroic.\nSuperman\nChristopher Reeve\u2019s famous \u2018Superman\u2019 series began in 1978 to much acclaim. It continued for a total of four films, ending with the quite poorly received \u2018Quest for Peace\u2019 in 1987. Reeve\u2019s Superman outfit certainly embodies the character\u2019s principled heroism, but this is still very much the outfit of a comic book character, rather than a movie star.\nLois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\nAfter Reeve hung up the cape in the \u201980s, Dean Cain stepped in for a television version of Superman beginning in 1993 and running for four seasons. The style of Cain\u2019s Superman didn\u2019t change much: if anything, it was a bit brighter and more cartoony than Reeve\u2019s. Though, to anyone familiar with the often-cheesy series, that probably makes some sense.\nSuperman: The Animated Series\nJust under a decade after the \u2018Superman\u2019 films ended, the hero once again became a successful animated star in \u2018Superman: The Animated Series\u2019. First airing between 1996 and 2000, the series came from some of the names behind the recently concluded \u2018Batman: The Animated Series,\u2019 to much the same results. The series presented a grounded Superman and found a similar level of television success.\nSmallville\nIt was a while before a live-action Superman returned to the big screen, but one did hit the small screen for quite a while starting in 2001. The Superman of \u2018Smallville\u2019 was a much different hero from the one that we\u2019re used to though, a young hero who wasn\u2019t always ready to jump into costume. In fact, while his classic outfit does appear in the show, for the most part this Superman was just Clark Kent wearing a red jacket and a blue T-shirt.\nSuperman Returns\nFinally, Superman returned to the big screen in 2006 in an all-too-fittingly titled film. Brandon Routh took over as the hero and presented one of the first big departures for Superman\u2019s on-screen outfit, introducing some texture to it and a clearly thicker material. The film saw generally warm reviews, but it ended up performing poorly at the box office and never saw a sequel.\nMan of Steel\nDirector Zack Snyder took Superman back to the big screen last year to much more success than the superhero had seen in a long while. It was a far more emotional look at the hero \u2014 having a story by \u2018Dark Knight\u2019 director Christopher Nolan certainly must have helped \u2014 and it served as the kicking off point for a much larger film universe from DC. Henry Cavill plays Superman here, and his outfit is by far the most different. For one, it\u2019s heavily textured and uses what looks to be a far more functional material. But more importantly, it eschews the campy red shorts that have long gone above Superman\u2019s blue suit.\nBatman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice\nIt doesn\u2019t look like much, if anything, will change between Cavill\u2019s debut as Superman and his coming return in 2016 \u2014 and that\u2019s by no means a bad thing. If anything, this first look serves to echo the gloomy peek at Ben Affleck\u2019s Batman that was released just a few months ago. It\u2019ll be a while before the two actually face off, but at this rate, it seems like there\u2019ll be a few more heroes to look at well before then.\n","Title":"See the evolution of Superman's costume in film and TV | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
