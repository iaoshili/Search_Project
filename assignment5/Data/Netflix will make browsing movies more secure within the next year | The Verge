Netflix will also roll out a revamped TV interface, according to the note, that \"will bring video playback forward into the browse experience.\" That's not terribly specific, but it sounds like a picture-in-picture mode or some type of new feature that previews selections as you browse them. And finally, since Netflix customers still stream licensed movies and TV content far more than the company's original programming, Netflix is exploring ways to balance out those viewing habits. \"We are also developing improved ways to promote Netflix originals to our members, using our data to help identify which members would be most likely to enjoy each original title.\"\n","Title":"Netflix will make browsing movies more secure within the next year | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech"]}
