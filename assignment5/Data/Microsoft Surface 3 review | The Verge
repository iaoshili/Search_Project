{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat is a laptop? What is a tablet? For most people, the answers are obvious. But for Microsoft\u2019s Surface line, it\u2019s been a bit murky.\nMicrosoft\u2019s first attempt, the Surface RT, flopped. So much so that the company had to take a $900 million hit when it failed to sell them all. Microsoft\u2019s second stab at tablets resulted in the Surface 2 with a sleeker design and better performance. It still wasn\u2019t easy to use on the lap, and the lack of a full Windows OS meant it was never really a laptop and never really a tablet due to a lack of touch-friendly apps.\nWhile mistakes have been made along the way, there\u2019s always been something charming and unique about the Surface and the fact that it\u2019s not just an iPad clone. It\u2019s never quite nailed what Microsoft was looking for, but there\u2019s always been promise there, hiding underneath that kickstand.\nSo now we have a third attempt, the Surface 3. It\u2019s Microsoft learning from all of its mistakes and bringing lessons from the bigger Surface Pro 3 down to a smaller and cheaper $499 tablet. Because it finally uses a full version of Windows, you can now run all the full Windows apps you\u2019d expect to use like Chrome, iTunes, and Photoshop. But is that enough? Is the third time the charm for Microsoft\u2019s tablet \/ laptop hybrid?\nWhen I first looked at the Surface 3, I honestly thought it was a Surface 2 from a year and a half ago. With the same silver matte aluminum finish, it still looks beautiful, modern, and premium. Dig a little deeper and you find some subtle \u2014 but important \u2014 changes. The Surface 3 is both thinner (8.7mm) and lighter (1.37 pounds) than its predecessor, and the dimensions have changed to make this more of a tablet than ever before. There\u2019s now a 10.8-inch display running at 1920 x 1280, which is slightly larger than the Surface 2, and a 3:2 aspect ratio finally makes it a lot more comfortable to use in portrait mode as a pure tablet. The display is bright and crisp and has great viewing angles. Surprisingly, I find the color reproduction is actually better than the Surface Pro 3, and the screen is brighter.\nThe design still looks beautiful and modern\nAs a tablet, the Surface 3 is still bigger, heavier, and thicker than the iPad Air 2, but you\u2019re also getting a whole lot more. There\u2019s a single USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, headset jack, and a microSD slot underneath the hinge of the kickstand. They\u2019re not the only ports, though: Microsoft has swapped its magnetic charging mechanism to Micro USB which means you can use a normal phone charger to juice up the Surface 3. It also doubles as a full-size USB port if you buy the necessary adaptor.\nIf you really want to have some fun, plug a Micro USB cable into the full-size USB and the charging port, and watch the Surface 3 charge itself. It doesn\u2019t really, but in a quirky moment, Windows briefly says it\u2019s charging before realizing it can\u2019t actually redefine the laws of physics.\nWhile the Surface RT and Surface 2 were difficult to use on your lap as a laptop thanks to the limited travel of their kickstands, the Surface 3 can work at three different angles. Disappointingly, it\u2019s not the same redesigned kickstand that the Surface Pro 3 uses, with the hinge to allow you to set it at any angle. On the Surface 3, the first angle is totally useless for the lap, and the second is only slightly better, but I found the third was the one I used the most. It\u2019s far from ideal, though, and I found myself longing for the adjustability of the Surface Pro 3. I use my laptop in weird positions a lot, with my legs crossed, on the floor of a trade show, in the back of a cab, and many other places.\nUsually I just move the screen back and forth to adjust the angle and rely on the sturdy base, but with the Surface 3 I found I had to adjust the way I was sitting instead. If you use it on a desk it\u2019s mostly fine, but it still becomes irritating if your desk doesn\u2019t work well with one of those three angles.\nPart of the lap use is eased by the introduction of a new Type Cover for the Surface 3. It\u2019s largely the same as the Surface Pro 3 version, just shrunk down for the 10-inch dimensions. It has new magnets that attach to both the bottom of the Surface and the screen so it\u2019s a lot sturdier. This is a great change, and it really makes a big difference for lap use. It features a full keyboard that\u2019s backlit, and I enjoyed typing away on it for brief periods of time. It\u2019s still nowhere near as nice as a real, full laptop keyboard, but it\u2019s close enough for me. Microsoft is clearly looking toward Windows 10 with the Surface 3, as the keyboard ditches the shortcuts for charms, settings, and other Windows 8 features for PrtScn, insert, and screen brightness controls. You\u2019ll need to buy a Type Cover separately for $129.99 as Microsoft still doesn\u2019t bundle the keyboard.\nWhile the trackpad has improved, it\u2019s still far too small. I complain about PC trackpads all the time, and I wish Microsoft and other OEMs would take note that they\u2019re simply not doing a good enough job. This is the primary input mechanism if you\u2019re using the Surface 3 as a laptop, and it spoils the experience if it mis-clicks or starts dragging files around randomly in File Explorer.\nThe Surface pen is accurate and natural to use\nA new way to interact with the Surface 3 is with a pen. While this has traditionally been part of Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro offering, the same pen from the Surface Pro 3 now works with this cheaper model. It\u2019s functionally identical, and it\u2019s really accurate and natural to write notes in OneNote, or just draw something in Fresh Paint. Like the Surface Pro 3, you can click the cap on the pen at any time (even when the screen is off) and it will launch OneNote immediately so you can start taking notes. It still feels like Windows needs some work to fully accommodate the pen in a more natural way, but using it inside certain apps makes me want to use it more. I just wish I could stow the pen away inside the Surface, but instead there\u2019s a weird loop you can attach to the Surface or the cover. Unfortunately, this pen doesn\u2019t come in the box like it does with the Surface Pro 3. You\u2019ll need to spend $49.99 to purchase it separately.\nBut the biggest change to the Surface 3 is what\u2019s inside. Microsoft has opted for an Intel Atom x7 processor, which means the Surface 3 can now run a full version of Windows 8.1 with support for traditional desktop apps. This isn\u2019t the same Atom processor from the dreadful days of netbooks, but the performance still isn\u2019t great compared to $499 PCs. I\u2019ve used iTunes, Chrome, Photoshop, and a number of other Windows desktop apps, and most of them run just fine at a basic level until you start to push things further. Steam is the big exception, as most of the modern games just won\u2019t run well at all. That\u2019s not really surprising, as this isn\u2019t exactly designed to be a gaming laptop for those titles, but if you want to play some basic mobile games from the Windows Store, it should handle those okay.\nDuring my days of testing I found that the Surface 3 just about got me through a day of work before needing to be plugged in. It stayed alive for 7 hours and 7 minutes in our battery rundown test, which is only 40 minutes shy of the Surface Pro 3. I\u2019d expect a little more from the Surface 3, but for many it will be enough. I have found that the Surface 3 is pretty aggressive at dimming the display or putting itself to sleep, even when it\u2019s plugged in. If you\u2019re charging and stop using the Surface 3, then it will sleep after just two minutes, so I\u2019d regularly go and grab a drink and return to a black screen. It resumes instantly, but I\u2019m not sure I need my laptop (or tablet) to turn off so quickly when it\u2019s charging.\nNearly enough battery for a working day\nOne of the irritating parts of the previous Surface models is the battery drain when it\u2019s not in use. I would regularly come back to my Surface RT or Surface 2 and find it had an empty battery, but the Surface 3 is much better. I found that it drains around 2\u20133 percent of battery over a 12-hour period without entering hibernation mode. That\u2019s pretty impressive, and I haven\u2019t worried about just putting it on standby and in my bag ever since. During all this time of battery testing and running apps or games, I never found that the Surface 3 got warm. There\u2019s no fan, no noise, and no heat, just like a tablet should be.\nThough it will be upgraded to Windows 10, the Surface 3 ships with Windows 8.1. The fullscreen apps and awkward navigation with a keyboard and trackpad on the Surface 3 is still a frustrating experience in Windows 8.1, but as a pure tablet, I still enjoy the gestures and the Start Screen. It\u2019s the mix that Windows 8.1 doesn\u2019t really get right, and it underlines the Surface as a product. It\u2019s a mash up, a weird combination of legacy and new. A laptop that isn\u2019t really a laptop, and a tablet that\u2019s nearly a tablet but doesn\u2019t have the touch-friendly apps to back it up. The Windows Store is at a standstill, and I\u2019m increasingly finding it hard to discover any meaningful finger-friendly apps.  StaffPad surprised me last week as a stunning Windows app, but it\u2019s designed more for the Surface pen than it is for touch.\nIt's a beautiful and confused machine\nMicrosoft has this same lack of apps issue on Windows Phone, and it feels like the company is waiting on Windows 10 as its hope for developer interest. Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for the Surface 3, and it should fix a lot of the weird inconsistencies of using this as a hybrid laptop and tablet, but it\u2019s not clear if it will lead to more touch-friendly apps for Windows. It also won\u2019t address the fact that the Surface 3 doesn\u2019t really know what it is. It\u2019s a beautiful and confused machine. It\u2019s fun to use, and it\u2019s really sleek and pretty, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d use it everyday. I love the fact that it\u2019s more versatile than an iPad, and I can immediately transition from playing a game to writing an article for The Verge without switching machines, but it\u2019s not good enough in either mode for me to justify giving up separate devices.\nAt its core, the Surface 3 is a shrunken-down version of the Surface Pro 3 that\u2019s cheaper and less powerful. For many, the $499 price is attractive, but once you\u2019ve added the Type Cover, it\u2019s nearly $630 \u2014 and that\u2019s just the base model. I reach for my Surface Pro 3 a lot at home because there\u2019s something about it I just love, but I always travel with a laptop. The Surface 3 won\u2019t change this for me. There ought to be a market for the Surface, because having the power of touch, keyboard, and pen in one single thin and light device is really compelling. But even three years into this experiment, there are just compromises I\u2019m not willing to make, especially on the laptop side. Unless you\u2019re on a tight budget, I would just recommend a laptop or at least the Surface Pro 3 with its adjustable hinge if you really want the pen and touch input.\nIt's time for a Surface laptop\nPerhaps that\u2019s just the story of the Surface. It\u2019s not the \"tablet that can replace your laptop\" so much as it\u2019s a tablet that wants to be a laptop, and maybe it\u2019s just time Microsoft made a Surface laptop. That\u2019s really what the Surface wants to be.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"Microsoft Surface 3 review | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","review","tech"]}
