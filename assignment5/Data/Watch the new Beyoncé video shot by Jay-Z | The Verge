{"Main text":"Watch the new Beyoncé video shot by Jay-Z\n'Die With You' is exclusive to Tidal, if you ignore the rest of the internet\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBeyoncé and Jay Z have been married for seven years now. To celebrate their anniversary, Bey wrote a song for Jay, Jay shot a video of her singing it, and they hosted it all exclusively \u2014 where else? \u2014 on  his Jay's new streaming service Tidal . The song is called \" Die With You .\" It's a sweet, piano-laced ballad that has Beyoncé reasserting her love for her husband in simple ways: \"I wake up just to sleep with you \/ I open my eyes so I can see it's you \/ And I live so I can die with you.\" It's very much an intimate home video, so naturally the whole world is interested.\nLest we forget that nothing is really exclusive on the internet, someone has already ripped the video and uploaded it to YouTube (and the song to SoundCloud), which you can watch above until someone inevitably makes the user take it down.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
