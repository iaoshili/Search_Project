{"Main text":"I, Casey Newton, interviewed a man named Casey Newton about his startup\nThe man behind identity-management service OneID chats with his doppelgänger\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs PR pitches go, this one had a good hook. \"Hi Casey,\" it read. \"I\u2019d like to introduce you to the other Casey Newton.\" For years I had been peripherally aware of the Other Casey Newton (O.C.N.). There are more than two of us in the world, of course, but to my knowledge there\u2019s only one O.C.N. here in Silicon Valley. I discovered him when I clicked on a link to what I thought was my LinkedIn profile : another white guy like me, only instead of writing about startups, he actually helped run them. At the time he was working for dull-sounding enterprise software companies, so I kept my distance. But I always wondered what he was like.\nIf you\u2019ve ever played Mortal Kombat, you know that at some point  Sub-Zero has to face himself . This was probably as close as I was ever going to get to that experience. And so I wrote the PR person back and said I would take the meeting. Via email, I tried to be up front with O.C.N. \"To be clear,\" I wrote, \"a LOT of this interview is going to be about Casey Newton and being named Casey Newton.\" He was game. We set a date.\nThat\u2019s how, one day last week, the Other Casey Newton and I met at The Verge\u2019s offices here in San Francisco. He\u2019s the CEO of a company called  oneID , which is releasing some new tools today. One is a free password manager and identity-management service that in some ways competes with apps like  1Password and  Dashlane . The other is a third-party login service, which works like Facebook Connect: other developers can integrate it into their apps and websites, letting oneID users log in without creating new accounts.\nHighlights of our discussion follow. This interview has been edited and condensed.\nCasey Newton: Who are you, and what are you doing with my name?\nOther Casey Newton: I\u2019m actually the Bay Area guy. I know you came in from out of town, so I should be asking that question.\nSome of my Twitter followers expressed concern that we may actually be the same person and that you\u2019re only here due to some sort of rift in the space-time continuum. So let\u2019s settle this once and for all: your parents are or are not Jim and Sally Newton, of La Habra, California?\nNo. John and Kathy.\nIn fact, you\u2019ve been working in technology for some time here, right?\nI have, yeah. I\u2019ve been in tech basically my entire career on the sales and biz dev front. I\u2019ve done everything from telecom and software to, ultimately, the web, where I\u2019ll never leave. I love it.\nI got into the startup scene; this is my second one. The  first one I joined at right around the same stage \u2014 employee no. 10 or 15 \u2014 and we had a good two-year run and were fortunate enough that  one of the major credit-card companies acquired the company. And that success gave me enough stupid pride that I could do it all over again.\nBut this time I was looking for a different challenge \u2014 we live in the Valley, and there are so many cool tech products out there. But most of them are just iterations of something else. And I really wanted something that was meaningful to me and, ideally, everyone I know. And oneID is that \u2014 everyone I know hates the password problem. If we can solve that for a good chunk of folks, that\u2019s great.\nSo you\u2019re working on oneID, which makes it even stranger that I\u2019m interviewing you, since in a way, we actually share an ID.\nThat has actually crossed my mind. Although when you go to get your oneID, you won\u2019t be able to have mine. So I beat you there.\nSo the username \u2018casey\u2019 is already taken?\nYup.\nAt this point O.C.N. turned the tables and asked me a question: how did I get into tech reporting, and in so doing start totally messing up his vanity Google searches? Answer: I had a previous life writing about state and local politics, mostly in Arizona. But I had a far greater interest in technology, and when I had the chance to move to San Francisco and write about it, I leapt at the chance. That was four years ago.\nNow you get to go wherever your interests take you.  Llamas ,  dresses , tech. Whatever.\nThe big three, as we call them in the news business. So tell me a little a bit how oneID works.\nAt this point O.C.N. tells me about oneID, which is conceived as a sort of passport for the web. The basic idea is that many developers and publishers don\u2019t like having to manage their own username-and-password systems, and many people hate having to create new logins for every app and website. oneID\u2019s solution is to store one of the keys to your accounts in its encrypted cloud, and the other on your device. When your device and account are connected, oneID will log you into the sites you visit automatically. The hope is that oneID becomes adopted as the web\u2019s standard login, killing off the password over time.\nBut passwords aren\u2019t going to die overnight, so oneID built a free password manager as a kind of bridge between the present and its hoped-for future. This appealed to me: 1Password is my favorite password manager, but installing it across all your devices can cost $50 or more. Unfortunately, oneID\u2019s password manager feels half-baked. You can\u2019t search your passwords, for example, and you can\u2019t import passwords from an existing manager. More importantly, the interface just feels confusing to me: I had trouble understanding how to add new logins, how to find old ones, and how to use the app to log in. There\u2019s apparently some powerful cryptography enabling the handshake between your devices and oneID\u2019s cloud, but neither the app nor the web client do a great job of walking you through it.\nThen again, it\u2019s possible I feel this way only because I am threatened by the potential social media dominance of Other Casey Newton \u2014 and so I invite you to check it out yourself. Anyway!\nAm I affecting your personal brand? Have you been in a situation where someone assumed you were a reporter?\nI did get an email once that said \"Did you write this?\" And then a couple of my friends who know who you are will [sarcastically] send me links with, \"Great article!\" It\u2019s starting to happen.\nDo you feel like this town is big enough for the two of us?\nI live in the East Bay. I only live here Monday through Friday. So you\u2019re on one side of Market Street, I\u2019m on the other. So let\u2019s just keep the lines drawn and send smoke signals when we\u2019re going to pass over.\nAnd with that, our interview drew to a close. Like many Casey Newtons, Casey Newton isn\u2019t just smart, friendly, or unbelievably handsome. He is also a great sport. And I wish him the very best, as long as he stays on his side of Market Street.\n","Title":"I, Casey Newton, interviewed a man named Casey Newton about his startup | The Verge","Tags":["apps","report","tech"]}
