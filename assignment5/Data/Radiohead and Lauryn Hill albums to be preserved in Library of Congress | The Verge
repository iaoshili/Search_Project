The library adds \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" records each year to its National Recording Registry, with the aim of preserving them for 15 years; public nominations helped OK Computer attain recognition.\n\"I see it as part of a certain ongoing phenomenon in rock music that maybe begins with the Velvet Underground but also The Doors, who are on the registry this year. Pop music is not entirely positive in its outlook, shall we say,\" curator Matt Barton said, in comments  reported by The Guardian . \"I think we can say that OK Computer really sums a lot of that up.\"\nHere's \"Paranoid Android,\" the extraordinary second track and first single from OK Computer:\nAlso selected for recognition by the library is 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the stunning and only solo album from the former Fugees member. Its trailblazing collision of R&B, hip-hop, and soul would have remained timeless and relevant without the library's preservation efforts, but there can't really be too many accolades bestowed upon this record \u2014 it's as great today as it ever was, and this latest decoration is well-deserved.\nHere's lead single \"Doo-Wop (That Thing)\":\nIn total, 25 recordings have been chosen for preservation this year, including the eponymous debut albums by '60s rockers The Doors and folk singer Joan Baez.\nThe full list is below.\nSorry, Wrong Number (episode of Suspense radio series, May 25, 1943)\nAc-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive (single) - Johnny Mercer (1944)\nThe Doors (album) - the Doors (1967)\nOK Computer (album) - Radiohead (1997)\nThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (album) - Lauryn Hill (1998)\nA Wild and Crazy Guy (album) - Steve Martin (1978)\nYou've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' (single) - the Righteous Brothers (1964)\nStand!
