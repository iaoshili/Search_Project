{"Main text":"Susan Miller, your internet BFF\nHow the star astrologer built a very digital, very personal empire\nBy Devon Maloney\nIt\u2019s a little after midday on a recent Saturday in Los Angeles, and I\u2019m escorting the reigning queen of astrology past a veritable throng of adoring subjects. She\u2019s just finished a 90-minute lecture (or perhaps more accurately, a motivational speech) at the Conscious Life Expo, a three-day jamboree of workshops and lectures whose guests run the gamut from sound healers to ancient alien experts.\nWe\u2019d spoken on the phone a few times before this, but within seconds of our meeting in person \u2014 with fans still trying to reach past her publicist to give her gifts and tell her just how much she means to them \u2014 Miller takes off her designer heels, clutches the crook of my arm like a prom date, and says, cheerfully, \"Walk with me.\"\nTogether with her publicist and an expo handler carving the path, our royal cabal weaves slowly, delicately, shuffling our way through maybe 50 people, many of whom Susan attempts to stop and chat with (inviting several to join her the next morning for breakfast, a meal we\u2019d already planned as our interview time). They\u2019ve all stayed behind in an attempt to connect with their idol, the celebrity astrologer whose public persona has become as much about the Susan Miller Mythos as her frequently uncanny predictions.\nAttendees of the Conscious Life Expo paid $65 to hear Miller speak, but the bulk of the astrologer\u2019s empire still rests on the 50,000-some-odd words she churns out every month for free \u2014 doggedly, some might say obsessively \u2014 meeting her readers where they are on social media. With the launch of a brand-new online TV show and the ever-multiplying host of outlets on which she peddles her cosmic insight, Miller has become a self-styled internet celebrity and a personal adviser to millions of intensely dedicated online fans.\n\"I do have a lot of irons in the fire, but I\u2019m disciplined,\" she tells me a few weeks later from the hospital (more on that later). \"It\u2019s just that I\u2019m launching so much, and everybody wants me to do [their project] first. \u2018Do me, do me!\u2019 I feel like a mother with a lot of children, and they\u2019re all tugging at my apron.\"\n\"If I see a bus coming at you, I have to push you out of the way.\"\nShe pauses for a moment.\n\"But you know what the old [saying] is: \u2018a change is as good as a rest,\u2019\" she says, her voice crinkling into an audible smile, the same way it does on stage when she\u2019s telling one of her many autobiographical anecdotes. \"You can\u2019t pick when life is going to give you opportunities. Sometimes nothing happens, so you have to kind of run with it when you can.\"\nMuch has been made over the past few years of the astrologer\u2019s meteoric rise to fame, thanks to (among other things) her ardent fashion-world coterie and all the press that comes with it. Her horoscopes \u2014 not only those notoriously prolific monthly essays for her own website, AstrologyZone.com, but now also for 10 other international fashion magazines, from Elle to Vogue Japan \u2014 offer intimate, personalized readings while still pulling millions of eyeballs. At this point, her chatty, practical delivery is just as important as the forecasts themselves. The resulting readership is an often-rabid crowd that boasts VIPs like Gloria Vanderbilt, Rihanna stylist Adam Selman, and even will.i.am.\nShe\u2019s quick to stress, in person and at every appearance she makes, that astrology is not fortune telling. In fact, her approach is far more like that of an empathetic life coach than a psychic. One could argue that the practical rationality she brings to an otherwise ambiguous practice is what makes her so successful.\n\"I have to have faith that I\u2019m telling millions of people the right thing,\" she tells me over lunch at the hotel restaurant the afternoon after her Expo appearance. (True to form, we have to reschedule that breakfast meeting so she can meet with those fans \u2014 they\u2019ve come to LA from overseas to hear her speak.) \"It\u2019s all my math, but if you don\u2019t do anything, nothing will happen. And that\u2019s where people get confused: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re [going to get hit by a bus]. Are you watching where you\u2019re going? I can tell you that it\u2019s probably not a good idea to bungee jump on a certain couple of days \u2026 But it\u2019s up to you, maybe if you take care, it\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m your friend, and if I see a bus coming at you, I have to push you out of the way.\"\nCompared to the rest of the Conscious Life attendees, who meander through the hotel\u2019s adjacent, bustling lobby on their way to the exhibit hall as we dine, Miller is a Wall Street analyst among Renaissance Faire cosplayers. Though her warmth keeps her audience\u2019s attention, it\u2019s pretty safe to say her international following wouldn\u2019t be half as devoted or widespread if it weren\u2019t for her intuitive, if unfussy relationship with the internet.\nShe launched AstrologyZone.com in 1997; for 16 years, she says, she wrote her tailored horoscopes faithfully on the side, often with little public validation. But in the 2000s, when astrology made its way back into the young, pop lexicon , all her work paid off. Since then, she\u2019s developed a massive, highly engaged Twitter following; written nine books; and negotiated and launched a subscription-based app. Today she continues to accept countless editor pitches and on-air appearance requests \u2014 in addition to her regular monthly AstrologyZone tomes and now monthly TV show tapings out here in Los Angeles. \"It\u2019s a good thing I only need to sleep four hours a night,\" she tells me proudly.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe this woman is a creature of the digital era\nYet in person, it\u2019s hard to believe this woman is a creature of the digital era: she\u2019s so analog, addressing you (whether you\u2019re a journalist, a high-fashion exec, or just a fan) directly, like a girlfriend or neighbor, in a manner that suggests she\u2019s too social to have time for online habits. But at the same time, she can spin a garrulous interview so lively and astutely talking-points-y that it makes perfect sense how she\u2019s able to churn out 50,000-plus blog-words every month in a matter of days.\n\"Look, I\u2019m concentrating,\" Miller says now, leaning toward me, showing me her empty hands. \"I\u2019m one of these people who don\u2019t look at my phone every five minutes. I\u2019m really with you. I think the nicest thing, the best gift you can give someone is your attention.\"\nIt\u2019s that sort of direct sincerity that, her producers say, will make for great television.\n\"Susan has grown a huge, huge juggernaut of traffic without ever sounding like she\u2019s lost her voice or doing the awful corporate sell-out,\" says Paul Duddridge, the producer and director of the new Astrology Zone with Susan Miller, which is hosted by online streaming production company and Hulu partner Television Four. (She says she originally developed a pilot with Lorne Michaels\u2019 Broadway Video, but those plans had fizzled; it was only recently that she met Duddridge and the TV4 crew.) \"What she has on her website is a complete, direct relationship with her readers, from day one. That is what we can do with new media. Since the beginning of \u2018new media,\u2019 she has had that.\"\nThere\u2019s almost no way to have a conversation with Susan Miller that does not include a detailed account of at least part of her life story. In a way, these picturesque yarns are inextricable from her reputation: the daughter of a specialty grocery store owner and a reader \/ amateur astrologist, Miller grew up learning natal charts from her mother and business strategies from watching her father do inventory; in the press and on her site, she frequently credits her success to her \"Little Mom\"'s pragmatic yet romantic faith in the future, both in the stars and in her daughter\u2019s professional life.\n\"My mother always told me that I must go to the highest technology,\" she says, \"[and] that I would start my career by writing. I said, \u2018Nobody writes in our family.\u2019 She said, \u2018I know, but we\u2019re gonna work on your grammar. And when you get older, some newly invented form of communication, so new that we don\u2019t know the name of it yet, will change the way you work and be the channel in which you make your ultimate contribution to the world.\u2019 I never forgot it.\"\nMiller spent years working on the business side of magazines and as a commercial photography agent \u2014 a job that would lead her to the media execs who gave her her first-ever online astrology columns. In 1996, she bought the AstrologyZone domain to write her own horoscopes, all of them multiple times the length allotted by established publications. She\u2019s remained a relatively early adopter since then: In 2009, she joined Twitter, where she regularly interacts with followers who tweet at her frantically, seeking love and career advice. In 2013, she and games developer Phunware launched her daily horoscope app . She considered YouTube videos at one time, but she says she \"need[s] beautiful lighting,\" and besides, \"I had to be paid for my TV; I have overhead and need to pay for my crack habit \u2014 my [all-free] website \u2014 with other jobs.\")\n\"She genuinely loves what she does and believes in it.\"\nEven though AstrologyZone has barely seen a redesign since it first donned its mid-'90s Angelfire chic, the fruit of Miller\u2019s forays into new media is apparent in every fan she speaks to: from the general admission spiritual crowd at Conscious Life to a room full of young, moneyed creative types in plush armchairs at West Hollywood\u2019s members-only SoHo House, her acolytes reference her past posts and explanations of different celestial concepts, audibly murmuring their appreciation, often in unison, whenever she shares a particularly astute reading.\n\"Susan\u2019s success [when I met her] was based on the same thing as her success now: she genuinely loves what she does and believes in it, and also genuinely loves people,\" says Cindi Leive, the editor-in-chief of Glamour, via email. Leive, a self-described horoscope skeptic, met Miller when she edited her at Self magazine. Today, she oversees the astrologist\u2019s Glamourscopes online video series , sort of mini-versions of her new show. Miller counts Leive among her closest friends. \"[Her] secret \u2026 has nothing to do with astrology and everything to do with Susan herself and her contagious enthusiasm.\"\n\"Susan is super-intelligent and just gets it,\" says Mickey Boardman, editorial director of Paper magazine and self-professed Susan Miller  stan . Boardman, initially a friend of Miller\u2019s daughter Chrissie, bonded with the astrologer via Twitter before meeting her at a dinner a few years ago; since then, Miller\u2019s own byline has appeared in Paper, with natal chart analyses written for the characters of Mad Men . \"She [is able to] speak to creative types in a way that we really understand, and she\u2019s great about moving with the times.\"\nHer drive to provide tailored experiences for a diverse audience is a business strategy, of course, but it\u2019s also something like a compulsion. She tells me fashion magazine editors from New York to Milan are regularly banging down her door with a never-ending queue of assignments, and she\u2019s only turned down one or two. Despite her wall-to-wall schedule, she insists I text her directly instead of setting anything up with her publicist.\nAt every turn, she seems to be gobbling up another opportunity\nShe also continues to accept interviews with reporters, even when they consistently write things that she says have \"wounded [her] so badly.\" This applies to her fans, too: in an age where online writers are urged not to read the comments, she reads every tweet, every reader quoted in a news story, every comment on her videos. Somehow she still refuses to meet their criticism with anything less than understanding (\"I keep reminding myself it\u2019s not me they\u2019re mad at,\" she told the New York Post last December ).\nAnd she\u2019s not just being polite when she invites persistent, almost intrusive Expo-goers to breakfast with her \u2014 she means she wants to have breakfast with them (or at least feels duty-bound to grant them that smartphone-free attention). If you, Susan Miller fan, want it and can pay for it, she will literally write you an entire book about your horoscope . At every turn, she seems to be gobbling up another opportunity, overflowing docket be damned, nearly incapable \u2014 or at least unwilling \u2014 to say no.\n\"[On the West Coast], when you say, \u2018You\u2019re laid-back,\u2019 they take it as a compliment,\" she says, laughing. \"In New York, we hit you! Oh my god, the biggest insult you can give a New Yorker is that you\u2019re laid-back!\"\nTrying to be in all places at once can, however, come with some serious consequences. Since birth, the petite astrologer has combated a so-rare-it-doesn\u2019t-have-a-name autoimmune disease that has become almost as famous as the horoscopes themselves. While most of the time all it does is limit her energy, sometimes, like this past week, it completely levels her: in 1992, three years before she founded AstrologyZone, she says she bled nearly to death in surgery, after which she says she had near-death aftershock hallucinations for weeks; in 2009, a broken left leg (the fourth break) waylaid her for months; and this past December, a hellish colonic infection cold-cocked her for several weeks (during which the New York Post ran that story quoting a few fuming fans that, as Miller says, \"gave the haters energy\" enough to tank the star-ratings on her app). She rattles off the exorbitant costs of her medications and horror stories about insurance companies cutting off coverage mid-treatment for a disease that, in their opinion, technically doesn\u2019t exist, while repeating the same thing she\u2019s told many reporters before me, just as casually: \"One dog bite to this leg, and I\u2019m dead.\"\nSo periodically, her reports go up a few days after the first of the month. This, as many outlets have doggedly reported , has been viewed by some vocal fans as completely unacceptable. They lose their damn minds across the internet, both outraged and straight-up panicked without her guidance, around which many say they plan their daily lives  \u2014 perhaps with good reason:  according to a 2013 New York magazine profile , her advice once won a friend a Porsche. (At her Conscious Life lecture, she boasts to the crowd that, against the advice of her accountant, she insisted upon buying stock in Apple \u2014 back when it was valued at 25 cents a share.)\n\"I don\u2019t think anybody just complains to complain,\" she says, again defending even those who consider her work a public service to which they are uniformly entitled. \"When [my readers] are angry, I think they may have been hoping I may have something to say that would trigger a creative idea, and now they don\u2019t have it.\"\nThe dichotomies of Susan Miller \u2014 the effusive celestial medium and the shrewd New York businesswoman, the fashion-conscious technophile and the interpersonally conscious family historian, the nonstop workaholic and the fragile House, M.D. case \u2014 have helped inspire the cultish fascination that surrounds her. But that last one could also undo her at any moment.\nTelevision remains one of Miller\u2019s last unconquered frontiers, and she and Duddridge say they have plans to eventually bring the web series to a wider audience, both via international streaming platforms and, ultimately, to mainstream cable. \"With Susan, you\u2019ve got a built-in audience, and if you do right by them, treat them with respect and actually tailor the project to them, you can take out that generalist cynicism [with online broadcasting] and let the audience have a direct relationship with the artist in question,\" says Duddridge. \"Up until now, this hardcore commercial juggernaut has been treated as a piece of frippery on mainstream TV, but Astrology Zone is proving what the grammar can be for a network.\"\nMeanwhile, Miller\u2019s eyes are on a far more elemental prize.\n\"I\u2019m just trying to keep my side of the sidewalk clean, do a good job, give people ideas so they can help themselves,\" she says, first to her lecture audience, and then later, again, to me. \"You walk through a bookstore, all those self-help books? They tell you what to do. I don\u2019t tell you what to do. I\u2019m not Oprah; I\u2019m not Queen Bey. I just want to be their friend.\"\nThree weeks later \u2014 after the expo, mere days before March horoscopes are supposed to drop \u2014 Susan is in the hospital. Again.\n\"This illness is either \u2026 you\u2019re wonderful, or you\u2019re crawling in the Sahara desert,\" she tells me over the phone from her bed at New York Presbyterian Hospital. The horoscopes arrived today, on schedule, but instead of posting late this time, she\u2019s opted for 600-word horoscopes, as opposed to the several thousand readers usually get. (\"\u2026I feel [these are] really special,\" she explains in her preface, \"as I wrote [them] with all the love I have to give you.\") \"I\u2019m not going to make a habit of it,\" she explains. \"But I was so, so sick that I couldn\u2019t [do more]. I literally couldn\u2019t type. I was in bed and couldn\u2019t even lift my arm.\"\nDespite having just given what sounds like an apology on behalf of her cardiovascular system \u2014 Miller isn\u2019t discouraged by the gossip she reads about her from fans on Twitter.\n\"You can get ideas from even your most frustrated reader.\"\n\"You can get ideas from even your most frustrated reader,\" she says. \"[In December] I was so, so sick, and a whole bunch [of Twitter fans] said, \u2018This [month\u2019s horoscope] isn\u2019t the real Susan, she\u2019s not writing. Her mother may have been writing [the horoscopes all along],\u2019 and that was hurtful. But I kept reading, as hard as it was, and then one of them said, \u2018The real Susan would\u2019ve given us little stories and anecdotes or little asides.\u2019 And I love writing those! I wasn\u2019t putting them in lately, and I thought, \u2018Oh, my goodness, they love that.\u2019\"\nShe says she spoke to Duddridge, who agreed that her anecdotes (many of which you\u2019re liable to hear more than once if you follow her with any regularity) worked for the show, and they made sure to keep the stories safe from the cutting room floor.\n\"Sometimes the reader is so upset, they sound all tangled in wires, and you have to get to them,\" she says, \"but every once in a while something will pop through, and I\u2019m grateful to that reader. Sometimes it\u2019s your critics that help you [the most].\"\n","Title":"How Susan Miller conquered online astrology | The Verge","Tags":["culture","features","long-reads","entertainment","longform"]}
