Since then, the crew has had to turn off nonessential equipment to conserve power. Today's effort follows  Saturday's successful mission , during which the engineers managed to remove a failing ammonia pump. The live feed of the repairs can be viewed below:\nThe last Christmas Eve spacewalk  took place in 1999 , when astronauts conducted repairs on the Hubble Space Telescope.\nUpdate: The crew has successfully installed a new ammonia pump, negating the need for a third spacewalk:\nThe crew has completed installing and hooking up the new ammonia pump to the #ISS .  Time to clean up the work site. pic.twitter.com\/9wMHQr66dj\n\u2014 NASA (@NASA) December 24, 2013\nUpdate 2: NASA announced on Twitter that the spacewalk is finally over.
