{"Main text":"Who will buy a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition?\nThis is Apple's Vertu\nUpdate: Read our  Apple Watch review .\nThe Apple Watch Edition will start at $10,000 and will go all the way up to $17,000, Apple\u2019s most expensive consumer-focused product ever. It\u2019s undeniably pricy, but Apple is going after the high-end Swiss watch market, which is still thriving . The Apple Watch Edition will be available in limited quantities and sold in high-end stores like Collete in Paris and Selfridges in London next to traditional watches from Rolex and Zenith. Even though it\u2019s priced to compete against high-end watchmakers, the Apple Watch Edition is missing many of the defining features most people who will drop five figures on a watch expect when spending that kind of cash. Here are some of the major hurdles Apple needs to overcome.\nExclusivity\nYes, Apple will sell limited quantities of the Apple Watch Edition. But there are other Apple Watches, and the company will sell millions of them. Buying a limited edition Apple Watch Edition isn\u2019t like buying a  Rolex Cellini or a  Patek Phillipe Calatrava \u2014 two of the watches Apple is competing against \u2014 it\u2019s like buying an 18-karat gold iPhone. Yeah, it\u2019s solid gold, but it\u2019s still an iPhone. Millions of people have it. You can\u2019t go a day without running into one. And that\u2019s not great when you\u2019re dropping well over $10,000 on a supposedly exclusive watch.\nResale Value\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight: the market for the Apple Watch Edition is not the same market as the Apple Watch or Apple Watch Sport. Is there some overlap? Sure. Some well-off early adopters and Apple fanatics will buy the Edition, but this is a blatant play for people who regularly pick up Swiss-made timepieces. If you want an Apple Watch Edition with a leather band, it\u2019ll cost you at least $15,000, the same price as a Rolex Cellini. If you\u2019re spending $10,000-plus on high-end watches on a consistent basis, you\u2019re expecting to recoup most of that when you decide to move on and get a new watch. And that is likely to be impossible with the Apple Watch Edition.\nThe Apple Watch Edition won\u2019t maintain its value\nThere are models of the Patek Phillipe Calatrava \u2014 which retails for $29,000 \u2014 from 1960 that are selling today for $17,000 . Even in 10 years, no one expects the Apple Watch Edition to be worth anything other than its weight in gold. Despite having roughly the same amount of 18-karat gold as the Calatrava \u2014 valued under $2,000, depending on the price of 18-karat gold \u2014  the Apple Watch Edition won\u2019t hold its value.\nAnd that\u2019s the problem with the current batch of smartwatches. Technology companies are entering an industry where time can add value, not decrease it. Pass down a Rolex from 20 years ago to your children, and it still has value. Give them a IBM ThinkPad from 1995, and they will think you\u2019re punishing them. Watch valuations aren\u2019t just about materials, either: it\u2019s about how the watch was constructed, its mechanics, how many were up for sale, how prestigious the brand is, how good the watch looks, and how it will age. Watch valuations aren\u2019t fully quantifiable, and Apple exists in an industry that attempts to put a number on everything.\nSecurity\nYou can walk down the street wearing a  $30,000 Rolex Submariner Date \u2014 the company\u2019s most popular watch \u2014 and no one would be the wiser. That\u2019s because it looks just like this Omega , and this Steinhart , and this $180 Seiko , and this $86 Invicta . You would have to be into watches to notice a high-end watch from a distance. But the gold Apple Watch Edition is a flashing sign above your head screaming \"I have money!\" Owning the most expensive product from the most popular company on Earth isn't exactly keeping a low profile. And if you\u2019re using the Watch as Apple intends, you\u2019ll be glancing at it much more often than you would a traditional watch, which won\u2019t help you stay inconspicuous. While some potential buyers will be just fine with that, many won\u2019t want to draw the unneeded attention.\nLegacy\nApple is one of the most storied and respected companies in modern history. But that legacy does not extend into fashion, or more importantly watchmaking. There\u2019s a reason the top watchmaking brands like Rolex, IWC, and Patek Phillipe have maintained their spots at the top of the industry for well over 60 years \u2014 it\u2019s a tough field to break into. Upstarts have opportunities at lower price points, but the upper echelon is reserved for the accomplished.\nApple is leveraging its reputation as a legendary tech company to sell a gold watch\nApple is leveraging its reputation as a legendary technology company to sell a 18-karat gold watch, but it may not be enough. Even high-end fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Burberry haven\u2019t garnered favor with their attempts to make watches, and they came in with a deep fashion pedigree. Could Apple\u2019s technology be the deciding factor? Perhaps, but that is a tall order, even taller than shifting into the phone market. These companies have been entrenched for over a century, and that time means more in watchmaking than just about any other industry.\nWhat is it for?\nHere\u2019s the biggest problem with the Apple Watch Edition. Most people spend thousands on watches for one of three reasons: they either collect watches, want to acquire an heirloom to pass down, or they want to make a fashion statement. Outside of collectors, the Apple Watch Edition doesn\u2019t check any of those boxes, and hasn\u2019t provided a fourth reason. Notifications? Probably not worth $10,000. Taking calls from your wrist? Tracking your health information? Possibly, but rumored features like a blood pressure monitor and blood oxygen trackers which would make this a slam dunk were left out of the Apple Watch.\nWhat you have is either a $10,000 watch that doesn't look as good as its competition, or a $10,000 notification center that you can also buy for a tenth of the price. It probably won\u2019t be on the wrists of celebrities and all over Fashion Week in September, and it\u2019s unlikely it will become a must-have luxury item. What does that leave us with? Who would buy a $349 device refitted with all-gold-everything and a price tag to match? The same people who buy products from Vertu. As a watchmaker told me, the guy who wears a Rolex every day may like the Apple Watch, but doesn\u2019t like that the regular version \"doesn't signal to the world what a Rolex will.\"\n\"The Edition takes care of that, or at least the monetary part.\"\n","Title":"Who will buy a $10,000 Apple Watch Edition? | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","apple-watch-spring-event-2015"]}
