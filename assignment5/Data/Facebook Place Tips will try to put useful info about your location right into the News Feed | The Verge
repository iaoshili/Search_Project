{"Main text":"Facebook Place Tips will try to put useful info about your location right into the News Feed\nA pilot program begins in New York City today\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFacebook is in the middle of an ongoing battle to make sure it always surfaces useful, relevant content in your News Feed \u2014 which is what makes a new feature the company is piloting a bit of a risk. As of today, Facebook users in New York City will be able to test out a new feature called Place Tips. Assuming you have location services enabled, the Facebook app will try to guess when you\u2019re in a popular or interesting location and surface relevant tips, photos, and posts from the place in question.\n\"News Feed today is a pretty good tool at connecting you to friends and news,\" says product manager Mike LeBeau,  \"but if we\u2019re Facebook and our job is to connect the world, what else do we want to connect you to?\" The answer to that question is \"the world around you,\" and given the proliferation of Facebook use on mobile devices, it\u2019s a logical move to make \u2014 and one that\u2019ll help the company surface the massive amount of photos, tips, and other data it has tied to specific locations and businesses.\nA new way to surface Facebook's location-based posts\nBased on the screenshots and the quick demo Facebook gave me, a Place Tip is a fairly unobtrusive slice that shows up in the top of your News Feed. It\u2019ll pop up when it looks like you\u2019re near, for example, New York\u2019s famous Strand Bookstore, and you\u2019ll see a feed of info should you choose to tap on it. Once you open it, you\u2019ll be able to check in to the location and see photos and posts shared by your friends who\u2019ve also visited the same spot. Naturally, it\u2019ll also surface information from the location\u2019s official Facebook page.\nLeBeau was quick to stress to me that nothing about Facebook\u2019s privacy settings had changed in regard to location, and users would only share their location if they chose to (and then only with the people they\u2019ve allowed to see such info). It simply surfaces publicly shared content related to that spot, as well as anything your friends may have shared with you from that location.\nOf course, in a city as densely packed as New York, nailing down your exact location is a bit of a technical challenge, something Facebook says was part of the reason it is launching Place Tips there. \"There are a lot of difficult technical problems to solve here,\" says LeBeau. \"Knowing for sure which business to surface\u2026 we\u2019re using GPS and Wi-Fi to try and figure out where you are.\"\n\"There are a lot of difficult technical problems to solve here.\"\nFacebook is going beyond the hardware built into your phone to find out where you are, though \u2014 the company is also deploying Facebook BlueTooth Beacons in \"a few small businesses that we\u2019re excited about.\" For starters, beacons will be deployed at the Dominique Ansel Bakery, Strand Book Store, The Burger Joint at Le Parker Meridien Hotel, Brooklyn Bowl, Pianos, the Big Gay Ice Cream Shop, and Veselka.Â These beacons will be used to concretely identify when someone using Facebook is in a store that has them deployed \u2014 although given the close proximity of businesses in New York, the possibility for misidentification still exists.\nThat\u2019s why this is all starting off as a pilot. \"We want to be really confident if we\u2019re going to show you something at the top of your News Feed,\" says LeBeau. \"As we started building this, we realized we need more confidence to show you the right and relevant things.\" As someone who uses Foursquare\u2019s Swarm app in crowded San Francisco with few location identification problems, it seems that Facebook can likely get this right, as well. When that happens, it\u2019ll start to roll out to more cities and more users, as well as the Android app (for now, the pilot is only for iOS users). For now, though, you\u2019ll need to be in New York City to give Place Tips a shot.\n","Title":"Facebook Place Tips will try to put useful info about your location right into the News Feed | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
