At 1pm ET.\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 24, 2014\nYou can rent it for $6. You can buy it for $15. http:\/\/t.co\/5LqxWRsvMn .\n\u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 24, 2014\nOn Tuesday, the Alamo Drafthouse revealed that Sony Pictures would now allow the film to be played in select theaters. As the day progressed, the  number of theaters playing The Interview grew into the hundreds. Notably, however, no major US theater has joined the list.\nLast Friday, President Barack Obama told the world that he thought it was a \" mistake \" for Sony to cancel the release of The Interview. Later that same day, the movie studio's CEO, Michael Lynton, defended the company's decision, saying it had no choice but to cancel the film's Christmas release date after  all major US theater chains refused to screen the film. He also  reiterated in a televised interview that \"we have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie.\"\n\"We have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie.\"\nThe question, until today, was how Sony would get the movie in front of the public's eyes. In that very same CNN interview on Friday,  Lynton said that \"there has not been one major VOD distributor [or] one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said they're willing to distribute this movie for us.\" He added, \"we don\u2019t have that direct interface with the American public so we need to go through an intermediate.\" That statement suggested that Lynton had entirely overlooked Sony's very own Crackle streaming video service, which is home to a number of Sony Pictures films.\nThe FBI has linked North Korea to the massive cyberattack that's crippled Sony Pictures since November 24th. The hacking group, which calls themselves the Guardians of Peace, has released massive amounts of internal Sony data and demanded that the company halt the release of The Interview. During Friday's press conference, Obama said the US \"will respond\" to the North Korean attack on Sony but didn't clarify beyond saying it would be \"proportional.\"\nFollowing threats of physical violence, all major theaters dropped the movie and Sony later canceled the premiere altogether. According to CNN, the hacking group last emailed Sony on Friday, threatening to release more data unless it (somehow)  removes all signs that The Interview ever existed . The film's official Facebook and Twitter pages, along with the clips from Sony Pictures' YouTube channel, did in fact disappear for a few days. Everything returned on Tuesday, however, when independent theaters started announcing Christmas Day showtimes.\n","Title":"Sony is now offering The Interview online via YouTube, Xbox Video, and Google Play (update) | The Verge","Tags":["culture","breaking","us-world","entertainment","national-security\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
