{"Main text":"Microsoft building service to stream apps and games to phones and tablets\nArcadia could bring a world of new apps to Windows\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is continuing its experimentation with streaming apps and games on Windows.  ZDNet\u2019s Mary Jo Foley reports that the software maker is building a service codenamed Arcadia, a reference to a planet in the Halo game series, to stream apps and games to Windows.  Microsoft previously demonstrated a similar streaming service at the company\u2019s annual internal meeting last year, but that largely games-focused technology has reportedly been discontinued in favor of a renewed focus on apps and games. Microsoft is currently developing Arcadia, and a  recent job posting hints that the work is part of the operating systems group (Windows) at the company.\nWhile Microsoft continues to work on  potentially bringing Android apps to Windows , ZDNet reports that the company floated its upcoming streaming service as a way for consumers to access additional apps that aren\u2019t available on Windows and Windows Phone. The streaming idea has reportedly been tabled, but Microsoft\u2019s work on running Android apps on Windows continues. It\u2019s not clear when Microsoft will bring app and game streaming to Windows, but the job listing also mentions that iOS and Android experience \"is a plus,\" suggesting that the company could launch its future service across multiple platforms. That would make sense given  Microsoft\u2019s focus on Android and iOS , but the service won\u2019t likely launch soon as it\u2019s only in the early development stages.\n","Title":"Microsoft building service to stream apps and games to phones and tablets | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
