If you don't know Villeneuve's name, you should: he's the filmmaker behind both Prisoners and Enemy, two films from 2013 that demonstrated a keen ability to generate tension, not to mention eliciting incredibly strong performances from his actors.\nThe as-of-yet untitled sequel to Blade Runner is said to take place several decades after Rick Deckard and Roy Batty battled it out in the original film, and while Scott won't be directing his presence should be felt. He's producing the film and came up with the story alongside original co-writer Hampton Fancher (Fancher is writing the new installment alongside Green Lantern and Smallville writer Michael Green). The Alcon Entertainment project is scheduled to begin shooting in summer of 2016.\nShooting is scheduled to begin in summer of 2016\nHarrison Ford will be returning to reprise his role as the titular replicant hunter, though according to statements Scott made last November the actor won't be the lead. \"Harrison is very much part of this one, but really it's about finding him,\" he  told Variety at the time . \"He comes in in the third act.\" That leaves open the question of just exactly who that lead will be \u2014 and depending on the story, one could easily imagine the director teaming up with frequent collaborator Jake Gyllenhaal, particularly given the actor's recent penchant for dark, noir-infused roles.\nBut in the meantime he's putting the finishing touches on his upcoming thriller Sicario, scheduled for release this September.
