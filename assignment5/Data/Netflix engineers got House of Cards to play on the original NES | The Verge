As an example, Cirino and Wolfe played the intro to House of Cards. Obviously this a fun experiment, something that almost certainly won't be released for regular Netflix users. Though I am curious if this app actually streams content. And if so, did the engineers use a custom modem or did they happen to have a classic  Teleplay Modem on hand?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
