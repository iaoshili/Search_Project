{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft  was left alone as the last manufacturer of Windows RT-based tablets, and now the software giant is no longer producing any RT devices. A Microsoft spokesperson has confirmed to The Verge that the company is no longer manufacturing its Nokia Lumia 2520 Windows RT tablet. \"We are no longer manufacturing Nokia Lumia 2520; however, those still eager to buy Nokia Lumia 2520 should visit Microsoft Retail Stores, MicrosoftStore.com, third-party retailers and resellers for the latest availability.\" The confirmation comes just a week after Microsoft revealed it has  stopped manufacturing the Surface 2 , another Windows RT tablet.\nWhile Lenovo, Asus, Samsung, and Dell backed Windows RT initially, all of the tablet makers pulled out due to slow sales and a lack of interest from consumers. It appears that Microsoft\u2019s experiment with ARM-based tablets has largely failed in a tablet market that is starting to show  signs of slowing down . A lack of touch-based apps, a confusing desktop mode, and odd naming made Windows RT a bizarre trial for Microsoft. Most PC makers have opted for Intel-based chips in 7- and 8-inch Windows tablets recently.\nAll eyes are now on Windows 10. Microsoft has shown  some features of Windows 10 for phones , but it\u2019s not clear if we\u2019ll see 7- and 8-inch ARM-based Windows 10 devices. A preview  version of Windows 10 for tablets is designed for 8-inch devices and above, and Microsoft is not commenting on its plans for future ARM-based tablets. With Surface 2 dead and Surface revenue improving thanks to stronger Surface Pro 3 sales, it\u2019s clear Microsoft is now focused on its \"professional\" Intel-based tablet. Windows RT is now a distant memory.\n","Title":"Windows RT is officially dead | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
