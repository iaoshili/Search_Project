Though they've cited TLC and Aaliyah as influences, they are \u2014 to my ear, at least \u2014 the spiritual descendents of Erasure.\nYears and Years are a gift to those who love absolutely massive pop hooks\nThe trio won the BBC's Sound of 2015 poll (previous winners include Ellie Goulding, Haim, and Sam Smith). That was enough to convince me to see them live at Le Poisson Rouge in New York. Though they only played a short set, Olly Alexander's falsetto was just as gorgeous live as it is on their EP Y & Y \u2014 something of a rarity in the age of autotune.
