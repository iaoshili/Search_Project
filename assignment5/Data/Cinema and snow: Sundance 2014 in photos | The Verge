It\u2019s the kind of scene where you can listen to Nick Cave talk about his movie in one moment, and then learn about the life of a local shop owner the next \u2014 and there\u2019s no telling which will be the more interesting conversation. Back from our trip, we take a look at the things we saw along the way.\nBryan Bishop\nSundance is a marathon, not a sprint, but I found myself wanting to catch every single thing the festival had to offer. When you haven\u2019t seen a new movie before \u2014 when nobody in the world has really seen the movie before \u2014 those first screenings are filled with the vibrating hope of possibility and creative potential. Add in the presence of the filmmakers themselves, and the intimate setting provides an experience unlike anything else. Despite the lines, logistics, and corporate sheen, Sundance continues to feel like ground zero for the next wave of emerging filmmakers \u2014 and the only regret I had was that I couldn\u2019t squeeze in just one more screening before I left.\nCasey Newton\nSundance is the one place where I don\u2019t mind waiting in line. People show up really early for movies at the festival, and while you wait you inevitably wind up introducing yourself to everyone around you. This year I met vacationing high school students, aspiring filmmakers, movie-loving retirees, and true fans in line to see movies they had backed on Kickstarter. Everyone had an opinion on which films at the festival were underrated, overrated, and \u201Cmust see\u201D \u2014 information I used to chart my own path through the catalog. I never see half the things I want to, but my fellow filmgoers help me see way better movies than I would otherwise \u2014 and distract me from the freezing temperatures that are a hallmark of Park City in January.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe calm before the storm.\nThe storied Egyptian Theatre in Park City, Utah.\nLyft had bands like Zach Lupetin & The Dustbowl Revival playing in cars on Main Street.\nDay two. To get some extra tickets, we stopped by the box office. Early.\nOther people had the same idea.\nGetting tickets for a Saturday screening is a lot like buying a new iPhone.\nFinally, into the gauntlet.\nTech companies had a major presence on Main Street.\n...and Airbnb was just around the corner.\nImportant end-of-the-day ritual.\nCrucial mode of transportation, and the best place to find out what movies people are loving.\nCatching a morning screening.\nNick Cave, Jane Pollard, and Iain Forsyth discuss their documentary '20,000 Days on Earth.'\nDirector Jake Paltrow answers a question during the 'Young Ones' Q&A.\nFrom the 'Boyhood' red carpet: Lorelei Linklater, Ethan Hawke, and Ellar Coltrane.\nDirector Gareth Evans and cast at the world premiere of 'The Raid 2.'\nTowards the end of the festival, even the HP Sundance House was looking quiet.\nThen again, maybe the weather had something to do with it.\nUntil next year.\n","Title":"Cinema and snow: Sundance 2014 in photos | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5099501"]}
