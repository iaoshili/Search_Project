{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWelcome to the first annual Verge Hack Week. We're totally blowing up our site: we've given our reporters and editors the entire week to play with new tools and experiment with new storytelling ideas, while members of our amazing product team have gathered in New York to help build all sorts of interesting new things. Learn more.\nWe love binge-watching TV shows and have been desperately looking for a chance to one-up our 12-hour  House of Cards season two marathon . As luck would have it, FXX is planning to show  every episode of The Simpsons back-to-back starting this Thursday, August 21st at 10:00AM ( here's a handy schedule ). Unfortunately, we can't watch 552 episodes in one sitting because, as we've been told by legal, it's unhealthy for one person to stay up for 12 days.\nThat's where you come in. We're asking The Verge community to sign up for one-hour \"blocks\" during the marathon and write 100 words (or less) for each episode, to be published here on the site. It should be a review, but if it's a poem, a personal narrative, a thematic cocktail recipe, that's probably okay, too \u2014  just remember that it has to be about the specific episode and that your name will forever linked to what you write. (We also reserve the right to reject your submission for whatever reason.)\n","Title":"We want you to help us review every 'Simpsons' episode ever | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","verge-hack-week-2014\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5794558"]}
