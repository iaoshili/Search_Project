{"Main text":"Sense is a glowing sphere that watches over you while you sleep\nThis sleek sleep tracker analyzes your bedroom, and your sleep patterns\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt age 19, Londoner James Proud decided to skip out on college and move to the States.\nAs one of several \"Thiel Fellows,\" Proud received a $100,000 grant from esteemed venture capitalist Peter Thiel to skip college, move to San Francisco, and start working in tech. Thiel didn\u2019t expect anything in return, and Proud didn\u2019t deliver \u2014 until now. Proud, now 22, is today announcing  Hello Inc and its first product Sense, a glowing polycarbonate orb that monitors sleep patterns and everything that happens in your bedroom in hopes of helping you catch a few more z\u2019s. Sense is available for preorder today on Kickstarter for $99. If Sense reaches its funding goal of $100,000 it will ship in Q4 2014 for a retail price of $129.\nSense measures temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound, and even the particle counts for pollen and dust in the air. It also includes a tiny circular \"Sleep Pill\" that clips onto your pillowcase. Like most sleep trackers, the Pill records your sleep patterns by measuring how much you move in your sleep, but without asking you to wear a wristband or strap a sensor to your mattress . The two gadgets report back to your iOS or Android device through the Sense app over Bluetooth.\nWhen you glance at the app in the morning, it displays a timeline of the prior evening. It might show you that at 3AM, you tossed and turned a bit because some lights came on, and at 6AM, your dog started howling, which caused some more stirring. Sense includes a microphone that listens to your room as you sleep, so it can actually play back the noises that woke you. Proud fed hundreds of sound samples into Sense \u2014 many of them snoring samples from YouTube \u2014 so the app might display \"snoring\" instead of \"abrupt sound at 3AM.\"\nNext\nIt\u2019s a useful feature, but a risky one to include \u2014 Google\u2019s acquisition of Nest drew fervent skepticism about  its potential for privacy intrusions , and Sense\u2019s microphone will likely elicit a similar response. Fortunately, Sense only records sound spikes, not all sounds, and stores sounds on your phone and not in the cloud. Also, Sense\u2019s mic only turns on once you\u2019ve stopped moving and gone to bed. \"It\u2019s not always recording,\" says Proud. \"There\u2019s a rolling 5-second window where it listens for loud events like a truck or dog.\"\nThe goal of Sense, like most fitness trackers and quantified-self devices, is to provide transparency \u2014 or \"sleep intelligence,\" as Hello Inc calls it. There are some cute features, like a built-in LED that makes Sense glow green if your room\u2019s conducive to a good night\u2019s sleep \u2014 and it only turns on once you\u2019ve turned off the lights. A yellow or orange glow means you should check the app to see what\u2019s wrong. If the air\u2019s too smoggy, you might want to replace the filter in your central air unit. If the room\u2019s too bright, you might want to invest in some blackout drapes. Common sense goes a long way towards better sleep, but Sense hopes to go further.\nNext\n\"With this, you can know every single night what\u2019s going on,\" he says. Over time, the Sense app will offer advice like \"You sleep best when the temperature is between 61 and 68 degrees, lower your thermostat?\" or insights like \"In the past month, you\u2019ve gone to sleep an average of 38 minutes earlier than usual.\"\nIf you hear recurring sounds in your Sense log, you might even discover that you have a sleep disorder. \"A large number of people are never diagnosed with this stuff.\" About 18 million Americans have moderate to severe sleep apnea, in fact, and 75 percent of them don\u2019t know it, according to the The New York Times. Sense isn\u2019t designed to diagnose any medical conditions, but could easily pick up the midnight coughing fits you didn\u2019t know you had.\nJames Proud\nSense might ask you to change a lot of things about your room or your habits, but there\u2019s one problem Sense solves completely on its own. Like the Jawbone UP and other sleep trackers, Sense can wake you up once you\u2019ve finished a REM cycle \u2014 instead of in the middle of one. In David Pierce\u2019s tests of the Jawbone UP band , he felt \"fantastic\" every time it nudged him awake, even if it was 30 minutes earlier than his alarm would have.\nProud is convinced, however, that people don\u2019t want to wear technology to bed. \"What if you could take everything in a wearable and embed it in a pillow?\" Proud asks. \"You should ideally be able to get into bed, wake up, and not have to check buttons or charge up or sync anything.\" The Sleep Pill, as it's called, will need to be replaced yearly. A final price hasn\u2019t yet been decided for replacement Pills.\n\"You should ideally be able to get into bed, wake up, and not have to check buttons or charge up.\"\nEven if Sense works as stated, it\u2019s going to be challenging to convince consumers to invite one more piece of technology into their bedroom. Proud seems to understand this. The promotional trailer for Sense is set to the same music as the movie trailer for Spike Jonze\u2019s Her, a film about man\u2019s intimate relationship with a new kind of technology. Assuming it works, Sense or something like it might come standard in the bedrooms of the future. After a while, Sense\u2019s alarm clock function might be the only feature you really notice, but for $99, that alone could be worth it.\n\"The one thing wearables have made people realize is that this is an important area,\" says Proud. \"Nobody\u2019s even looking at the room that you spend a third of your life in!\"\n","Title":"Sense is a glowing sphere that watches over you while you sleep | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","report","design","tech"]}
