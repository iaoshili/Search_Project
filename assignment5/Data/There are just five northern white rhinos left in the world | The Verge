The 44-year-old male rhino, named Angalifu, apparently died of old age Sunday, the  Associated Press reports . Conservationists at the park had hoped that Angalifu would mate with a female northern white rhino named Nola, but their attempts proved unsuccessful.\n\"Angalifu's death is a tremendous loss to all of us,\" Randy Rieches, the safari park curator, said in a statement. \"Not only because he was well beloved here at the park but also because his death brings this wonderful species one step closer to extinction.\"\nAngalifu passed away. 5 northern white rhinos remain #RIP #EndExtinction Pls share condolences.

Last week, authorities at the Kenya sanctuary  announced that their one male and two females will not breed naturally, forcing them to try in-vitro fertilization instead.\nThere were around 2,000 living northern white rhinos  as recently as 1960 , mostly in southern and central Africa, but poachers soon ravaged the population. By 1984, there were just 15 remaining. Rhino horn is believed to hold healing powers in traditional Asian medicine, and high demand for the material has driven up prices on the black market. Earlier this year, officials in South Africa announced that more than  1,000 rhinos were killed in 2013 , nearly double the previous year's total.\nAlthough the outlook may seem grim for the northern white rhino, there is cause for hope. The southern white rhino was considered extinct in the 19th century, until a small population was discovered in South Africa. Ensuing conservation efforts gradually brought the animals back to life. According to WWF, there are  more than 20,000 southern white rhinos alive today.\n","Title":"There are just five northern white rhinos left in the world | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
