{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle is continuing to expand and add to its  Google Art Project , with the latest update allowing museums and galleries to upload 3D objects to the online art-sharing platform. Following the feature's launch today, more than 200 3D-scanned artifacts have been added. Highlights include a 9,000-year-old mask \u2014  the oldest in the world \u2014 from the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and a vast, macabre, and fascinating collection of animal skulls provided by the California Academy of Sciences . The 3D objects in Google Art Project are labeled as such, and users can simply click on them with their mouse or trackpad and spin them around or zoom in and out.\nspin the skull is the new spin the bottle\nIt's a neat addition to the  growing art platform , and the skulls particularly are fun to browse, letting you explore in detail the  similarities and differences between different animals' bone structure. However, it would've been nice if the museums involved had also followed the example of the British Museum, which not only  scanned and uploaded 3D models of some of its artifacts , but also made them free to download. Exploring historical objects in three dimensions is one thing, but we can't wait until you can 3D print your own museum at home.\n","Title":"Google Art Project goes 3D with vast, macabre collection of animal skulls | The Verge","Tags":["google","culture","tech"]}
