{"Main text":"The feds want Reddit to rat on its dark web forum members\nThe site has been subpoenaed for information on five users\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe may not have heard the last of the massive Evolution drug market. The dark web marketplace  abruptly disappeared \u2014 along with users' bitcoin \u2014 earlier this month, but there are new indications that law enforcement is looking into what happened.  Wired reports that the Baltimore Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement has subpoenaed Reddit for information on five users of Reddit's  r\/darknetmarkets , all of whom discussed the fall of Evolution.\nThe subpoena, according to Wired, requests potentially identifying information, such as the IP addresses of the users. (It also, apparently, asks for financial information \u2014 something far from necessary to create an account and post on Reddit.) Four of the users claimed to have varying amounts of information on Evolution, while the fifth was a security researcher named Gwern Branwen, who speculates he received a subpoena when another user promised to send him delicate information on Evolution administrators, which he claims never to have received. Branwen revealed the subpoenas to Wired and subsequently wrote about them in  a Reddit post .\nIt wouldn't be a surprise if law enforcement were interested in Evolution. The site \u2014 which sold weapons and credit card information, as well as drugs \u2014  was a massive hub, which, before its collapse, rivaled even the better-known Silk Road 2.0.\n","Title":"The feds want Reddit to rat on its dark web forum members | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world","tech"]}
