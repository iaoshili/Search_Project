{"Main text":"Uber brings food delivery service to Barcelona\nUberEats promises lunch and dinner delivery in under 10 minutes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber today  announced that it's launching a food delivery service in Barcelona, promising meals from local restaurants in under 10 minutes. The taxi-hailing company  launched the same service last year in Los Angeles, under the name UberFresh; in Barcelona, it's branded as UberEats. Today's announcement marks the first time that Uber has launched a food delivery service outside of the US.\nUberFresh becomes UberEats\nAs in Los Angeles, UberEats users in Barcelona can use the standard Uber app to order lunch and dinner from a daily menu. The feature was launched in partnership with  Plateselector , a Barcelona food guide website, and its menu will be regularly updated with new selections.\nUber has faced controversy in Spain and  other European countries , amid debates over how to regulate its on-demand chauffeur service. The company was  temporarily banned in Spain last year after a judge ruled that it posed unfair competition to existing taxi services, though the app is  now available in Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
