{"Main text":"You can play the new Unreal Tournament right now for free\nUnreal Tournament is coming together with the help of its community\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTechnically the new free-to-play Unreal Tournament has been playable for awhile now. Epic Games made the shooter available as a collection of tools, hoping to engender a community of modders that would help the studio create the new game. Not till today, though, could players play the first high-resolution map designed by Epic proper. Originally shown in early technical demonstrations, the map calls to mind Ridley Scott's sleek-but-grimy aesthetic in Alien.\nThe map launches alongside a marketplace, new characters, and additional weapons. Players can  sign-up for the pre-alpha here .
