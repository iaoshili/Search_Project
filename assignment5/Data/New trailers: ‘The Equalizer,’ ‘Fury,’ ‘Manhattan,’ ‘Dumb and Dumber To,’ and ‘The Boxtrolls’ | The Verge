{"Main text":"13 Comments\nThere are two big movies hitting your local theater this weekend, and you can\u2019t really miss with either one. DreamWorks Animation\u2019s How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a beautiful, charming movie perfect for families or anyone in the mood for something light-hearted. 22 Jump Street, on the other hand, is just about the polar opposite: a raucous and hilarious action-comedy that ups both the laughs and clever pop-culture references of the original. Of course, that\u2019s just scratching the service of all the movies and shows that will be coming in the months ahead \u2014 so let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nThe Equalizer\nBack in the 1980s there was The Equalizer, a TV show about a retired spy who used his skills to help out the less fortunate. Of course, since we\u2019re in the days when anything and everything can be rebooted , it\u2019s now a movie as well. Denzel Washington takes on the lead role, but judging from this teaser trailer the 2014 Equalizer is a little more brutal than his television counterpart. Here\u2019s hoping there\u2019s not a gritty reboot of Riptide in the works to match.\nFury\nWriter-director David Ayer has examined modern-day police officers in films like Training Day and End of Watch, but in Fury he heads back to World War II. This featurette debuted during E3 this week, and offers up an early glimpse at the project and its stars Brad Pitt, Michael Pe√±a, and Shia LaBeouf.\nManhattan\nCable channel WGN America has been making a push into scripted original programming lately, and this upcoming drama looks to be its most promising project yet. Set in the 1940s in Los Alamos, New Mexico, it examines the lives of the people working on The Manhattan Project as they create the first atomic bomb.\nDumb and Dumber To\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels first starred as two dimwitted friends who find themselves on a comic adventure. Now the duo have re-teamed with the Farrelly brothers for a new sequel \u2014 and yes, the bad haircuts are back as well.\nThe Boxtrolls\nWhen it comes to animation techniques, there\u2019s nothing quite like stop-motion. There\u2019s a surreal, magical quality to the look it creates, and no one is pursuing the art form quite like Portland\u2019s Laika Studios. After creating ParaNorman and Coraline, Laika is now readying The Boxtrolls, based on Alan Snow\u2019s novel Here Be Monsters! You\u2019ll be able to see it this September.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018The Equalizer,\u2019 \u2018Fury,\u2019 \u2018Manhattan,\u2019 \u2018Dumb and Dumber To,\u2019 and \u2018The Boxtrolls\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
