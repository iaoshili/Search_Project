{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nActor Paul Reubens has made no secret about the fact that a new Pee-Wee Herman movie is in the works, and today we're getting a sense of where you'll be able to see it: Netflix.Â  The Wrap reports that the video streaming company is close to sewing up a deal to distribute the upcoming film, which will be produced by Judd Apatow, the comedic mastermind behind The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Freaks and Geeks, and a slew of other recent films.\nNetflix has become an increasingly frequent go-to for filmmakers and projects that can't find support or interest at traditional studios or networks (the new Pee-Wee film was initially set up at Universal). After considerable success with original television programing, the company announced earlier this year that its first original film would be a sequel to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that it would release both online and in Imax theaters \u2014 though that announcement caused such uproar from theater owners that some refused to play the film outright . It's not clear whether the new Pee-Wee film will be online-only or if Netflix will attempt a theatrical component as well, but the company continues to snap up projects to fill its expanding library of original content with no signs of slowing.\n","Title":"The new Pee-Wee Herman movie is reportedly coming straight to Netflix | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
