{"Main text":"YouTube star Michelle Phan has officially outgrown YouTube\nThe beauty personality is launching an online video network\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMichelle Phan is one of YouTube's biggest celebrities \u2014 but she might be outgrowing the service. Phan, who built a business on fashion and beauty advice, is launching her own online network.\nPhan will be working with other beauty, lifestyle, and health personalities to program the network,Â  called ICON , which launches today in the US and UK. While Phan's work will still appear on YouTube, more videos from ICON will start appearing on DailyMotion and Roku, as well as on major social media sites, apps for Android and iOS, and on the web. The network's a partnership with Dutch entertainment company Endemol, which will presumably use its corporate cachet to work on distribution for the videos.\nIt's been clear for some time now that Phan's YouTube home wasn't enough for the young entrepreneur. Along with amassing more than 1 billion views on YouTube, Phan has ventured into other avenues, launching a cosmetics line with L'Oreal and a book with Random House. The ICON deal seems to be one more way to ensure the Phan universe reaches well beyond a single website.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
