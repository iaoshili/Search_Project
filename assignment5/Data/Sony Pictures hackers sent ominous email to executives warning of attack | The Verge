{"Main text":"Sony Pictures hackers sent ominous email to executives warning of attack\n\"Pay the damage, or Sony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe group responsible for the  catastrophic hack of Sony Pictures warned executives at the company three days before carrying out its attack, according to  email evidence discovered by Mashable among the leaked material. This email was reportedly sent to CEO Michael Lynton and chairman Amy Pascal, among others:\nWe've got great damage by Sony Pictures.\nThe compensation for it, monetary compensation we want.\nPay the damage, or Sony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole.\nYou know us very well. We never wait long.\nYou'd better behave wisely.\nFrom God'sApstls\nMashable found the email inside files from the account of Pascal, who apparently didn't read the message. It's signed \"God'sApstls,\" a term said to have appeared in malware used in the initial attack on Sony Pictures' systems on November 24th.\nAlthough the perpetrators of the hack are still unknown,  some evidence suggests that the incident may be linked to North Korea. The secretive state has  expressed outrage over The Interview , a Sony Pictures movie centered around a plot to assassinate DPRK leader Kim Jong-un. This email's non-native English and apparent sense of having been wronged by Sony Pictures could further point to a connection with the country, which is known to employ thousands of hackers.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
