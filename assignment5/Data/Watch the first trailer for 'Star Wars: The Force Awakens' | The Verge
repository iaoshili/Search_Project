{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's finally here: a first look at the new Star Wars. The teaser trailer runs 88-seconds long and isÂ  available to watch online and in theaters starting today. Here's all you need to know: it looks really, really good. The trailer gives a first glimpse at a lot of the new and returning stars, but it also shows just how great a job director J.J. Abrams' appears to have done in putting back together the Star Wars universe. A great score from John Williams elevates that even further. This isn't much for now, but it ought to get fans' hopes way up.\nRead next: every scene from The Force Awakens trailer\nWhile this is only a short glimpse at The Force Awakens, this is the first look that we've gotten at all. That's partly because Disney has been incredibly secretive about the production of Episode VII, but it's also for a much simpler reason: the movie still isn't done. Filming wrapped at the beginning of the month, but the movie is still a long way from completion. That'll be especially true for its special-effects shots, which are likely far from complete at this point \u2014 and certainly not at a stage where most can be shown off.\nThe film is still a year away\nThis teaser is more about getting fans excited and putting Star Wars back on everyone's radar than about actually introducing this new film. There's a lot more to see \u2014 and we certainly will \u2014 but there's still a ways to go before the film comes out next year on December 18th.\n","Title":"Watch the first trailer for 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
