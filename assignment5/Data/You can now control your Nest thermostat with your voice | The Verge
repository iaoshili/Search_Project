{"Main text":"You can now control your Nest thermostat with your voice\nGoogle app gains ability to change temperatures, monitor Nest thermostat systems\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNest thermostat owners with Android or iOS smartphones are getting a treat today: Google has enabled Nest thermostat control within the Google app, letting you change the temperature with just your voice.  Android Police reports that standard commands such as \"OK Google, change temperature to,\" \"set Nest to,\" \"turn the thermostat to,\" and others followed by a numerical degree will adjust the system. Presumably, voice commands through an Android Wear smartwatch will also let you change the temperature in your home. Android Police also says that Google Now will display cards when the system adjusts itself automatically.  Droid-Life first reported that this functionality was close to launch late last week.\nOwners of Nest systems will have to  opt-in to provide Google with access to their accounts, as well as  enable Google Now cards for Nest. It doesn't seem like you can do as much with just your voice as you can with the full Nest app, but it can make you feel like your house is the bridge of the Starship Enterprise.\nCorrection: This post has been updated to reflect that Nest functionality is available on both Android and iOS. It's also clarified that the function worths through the Google app, not only Google Now.\nVerge Video Archives: Interview with Nest Co-Founder Matt Rogers at CES 2014\n","Title":"You can now control your Nest thermostat with your voice | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
