{"Main text":"The most remote mini golf course on Earth will be gone in November\nWorld burns while humanity putters\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere is a miniature golf course perched atop the summit of La Rhune, a 905-metre (about 3,000 feet) mountain that sits on the border between France and Spain. The colorful, quirky installation is made up of letters spelling the word, \"Panorama.\" Each of them is a self-contained course, with unique obstacles and a distinctive theme. \"A,\" in one example, represents \"Aquatic\" while  \"O\" is for \"Ordinateur\" (French for Computer). Contrary to its sunny appearance, Guillaumit and Thomas Bernard's ABCDgolf is also intended to be a statement about man's impact on the environment.\nThe project is part of the Panoramika event, which celebrates the 90th anniversary of La Rhune's iconic train. Festivities began on February 15th, and will run until November 11th when the train is shut down for winter. During this time, visitors will be able to check out musical pieces, view contemporary art, and purchase souvenirs from local virtuosos.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe ABCDgolf installation sits atop the La Rhune mountain, which lies on the western end of the Pyrenees.\nOutfitted with unique obstacles, each letter is emblematic of a different universe.\nABCDgolf is also intended to be a statement about humanity's impact on the environment.\nThe Panoramika event for which ABCDgolf was made will run until November 11th.\n","Title":"The most remote mini golf course on Earth will be gone in November | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
