It\u2019s part of aÂ  Lumia Denim update that\u2019s rolling out to Lumia Windows Phones over the next few weeks, and the most important changes are improvements to the camera. Lumia phones are known for their impressive camera hardware, but the software has sometimes been a step behind. Launching the camera on Lumia phones can be painfully slow, and even capturing and autofocus isn\u2019t always particularly speedy compared to the iPhone 6 or some top Android devices. Microsoft is aiming to fix some of these problems with the new Lumia Camera app.\nRich capture has changed the way I take photos\nThe first thing I noticed when I launched the app was the improvement to how quickly I can take photos. It\u2019s only slight, but it\u2019s enough not to make the app feel like it\u2019s loading in the background while you desperately wait to capture the moment. Autofocus feels largely the same, perhaps a little snappier, but the biggest and most significant improvement is a new rich capture mode. It has literally changed the way I use the camera on the Lumia 930, and it\u2019s seriously impressive. Rich capture works by simply calculating the best mode to take your picture in, and it includes a slider at the end to change the HDR level if it\u2019s daylight, the exposure levels if it\u2019s in low-light conditions, and even the flash level if it\u2019s dark and the camera has triggered the flash.\nDynamic flash is the most interesting rich capture mode and the one that I found works well enough to make me want to use flash more often. I usually disable flash and never think about it again, but the new Lumia Camera software offers up a handy slider that allows you to go from a non-flash image all the way through to the same image with full flash enabled. It does this by capturing multiple images at the same time, allowing you to slide gradually between the results. You can see in the GIF below that there\u2019s a lot of flexibility to pick the sweet spot for the camera flash. Dynamic HDR and exposure modes work in the same way, with a slider to pick the best result.\nMicrosoft has also enabled a new video capture mode where you can press and hold on the shutter button to record 4K video quickly and then save still 8.3-megapixel images from a slider view afterwards. It\u2019s a better way of surfacing an old \"Lumia Moments\" feature that lets you choose the best frame and action shots, but it\u2019s clear Microsoft is thinking about better ways to integrate these separate and often confusing novelty apps into the main camera interface. The result is a much better approach with a camera app that feels a lot more complete and functional, with basic and quick settings for those who don\u2019t want to dig into the powerful manual controls. I don\u2019t say this often, but I\u2019m genuinely impressed with what Microsoft is doing to improve its camera software. Apple and Google could certainly learn a few tricks from this new Lumia Camera app.\n","Title":"Microsoft\u2019s new Lumia Camera app features some impressive tricks | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","hands--on","tech"]}
