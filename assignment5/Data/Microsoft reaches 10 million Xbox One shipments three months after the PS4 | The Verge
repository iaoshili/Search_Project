{"Main text":"Microsoft reaches 10 million Xbox One shipments three months after the PS4\nA Microsoft milestone\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is revealing today that it will \"shortly\" have shipped 10 million Xbox One consoles to retailers. The significant milestone comes exactly three months after Sony first revealed it had hit 10 million sales of its PlayStation 4 console worldwide. Microsoft\u2019s sales figures count devices shipped to retailers, rather than sales directly to consumers. The PS4 has outsold the Xbox One for nine consecutive months with a total of 13.5 million units, but Microsoft hints that Sony's winning streak might be coming to an end soon. \"As we head into the busy holiday season Xbox One led generation 8 console sales in the US for the past two weeks,\" says Microsoft\u2019s devices and studios chief Yusuf Mehdi.\nIf Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One sales are on the rise then it\u2019s likely down to a  recent \"temporary\" $50 price cut , and Mehdi admits \"sales have skyrocketed since the new price took effect\" earlier this month. \"Compared to the previous week, Xbox One sales in the US have more than tripled.\"  Microsoft is now betting on Halo to boost Xbox One sales alongside the $349 price tag and a series of console bundles ready for the holidays. Microsoft might still be behind Sony\u2019s popular PlayStation 4, but both consoles shipping at least 10 million units in their first year of release is nothing short of impressive.\n","Title":"Microsoft reaches 10 million Xbox One shipments three months after the PS4 | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","gaming","tech"]}
