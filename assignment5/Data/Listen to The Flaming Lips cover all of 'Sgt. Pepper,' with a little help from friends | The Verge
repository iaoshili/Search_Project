{"Main text":"Listen to The Flaming Lips cover all of 'Sgt. Pepper,' with a little help from friends\nWith guest stars Miley Cyrus, Moby, and more\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Flaming Lips have kind of just done  whatever weird projects they want to lately, and their newest is  a cover album of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band that has a whole bunch of other artists joining in to help. Those artists include Miley Cyrus and Moby on a cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" Tegan and Sara for \"Lovely Rita,\" and \"My Morning Jacket\" for the title track, among about two dozen other artists. It's a very eclectic set, but that just makes it all the better here.\nThese songs are so good that it's pretty hard to mess them up, and while The Flaming Lips' covers do make things weird (or, perhaps, weirder), a brief listen suggests that they don't go far enough to destroy what's already so great about The Beatles' original music. Instead, the covers just sound like a group of talented musicians having fun with some great tracks \u2014 and that's pretty awesome to listen to. The entire album, called With A Little Help From My Fwends, is  now streaming on NPR , and it'll be on sale October 28th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
