{"Main text":"This tiny wearable robot can zip your jacket for you\nMIT's new Zipperbot is capable of opening and closing zippers on its own\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDARPA's Atlas robot can  respond to disasters , and the US Navy's SAFFiR  can put out fires , but what about robots that can perform the necessary but mundane tasks of daily life? MIT's Personal Robotics Group is attempting to answer that question with  its Sartorial Robotics project , whose goal is to \"enhance the social aspects of human-robotic interaction.\"\nAutonomous zipper control\nOne of Sartorial Robotics' inventions is the Zipperbot, a small wearable robot capable of opening and closing zippers. When charged, the bot can scurry up and down and around contours. It's still a little too large to fit on your average pants fly, but it may be useful for certain labor uniforms like hazmat suits or spacesuits.\nPopular Mechanics says the robot will come in handy when you don't want to \"fumble with your coat zipper while you've got your winter gloves on,\" which begs the question: Who's putting their gloves on before their coat?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
