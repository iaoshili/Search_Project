{"Main text":"The director behind Fast & Furious 6 will take on Star Trek 3\nThe Enterprise is about to get seriously crazy\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAfter undergoing a veritable director merry-go-round, Star Trek 3 has reportedly landed a new director \u2014 and the choice all but guarantees we're about to see the most insane Enterprise adventure yet.  Deadline is reporting that Justin Lin, the filmmaker behind three movies in the Fast & Furious franchise (including Tokyo Drift and  last year's Fast 6 ) will be taking the reins.\nLin steps into the role vacated by writer-producer Roberto Orci, who co-wrote the first two J.J. Abrams Star Trek films and was  named to direct the third last May (Abrams, of course, left Trek to take on  that other space franchise ). It would have been Orci's first time behind the camera, but he left the project earlier this month. While several fascinating filmmakers were rumored to have been on the Star Trek short list \u2014 including Edgar Wright \u2014 according to Deadline's report Lin was the only person to get a firm offer. Which we hope means that Bad Robot and Paramount are looking for a Trek with more explosions, more familial bonds, more insane plot twists \u2014 and maybe, just maybe, Kirk and Spock blasting out the front of an exploding Romulan Bird-of-Prey.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
