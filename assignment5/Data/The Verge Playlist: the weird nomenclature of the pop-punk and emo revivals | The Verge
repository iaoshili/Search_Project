{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe last few years has seen a big return of two particular music scenes: emo and pop-punk. Both had big moments in the recent decades \u2014 emo in the 90s, and pop-punk at the turn of the century \u2014 but the early aughts saw the most popular bands from each scene \"make it\" while the rest of them broke. Now the scenes are bigger, they\u2019re more openly progressive, and the bands that comprise them are good. The wonderful mix of young talent and veteran bands blend being clever with the flat-out bizarre \u2014 especially in the way they name things. From the bands' names (Tigers Jaw, A Great Big Pile of Leaves, Andrew Jackson Jihad) to the album titles (Have You Seen My Prefrontal Cortex?, Chicago Bowls), and especially the song titles below, you couldn\u2019t get any weirder if you cut up a dictionary and stirred up the pieces.\nNow before you say what I know you\u2019re going to say, let it be known I\u2019m casting a really wide net on purpose with these genres here. People get really touchy when you throw these terms around, or claim that the scenes ever really went away . Genres are imperfect methods of classification, but it\u2019s the best we can do save for wasting our breath hyphenating 10 words to accurately describe a band\u2019s sound. So let go of that nonsense and have some fun with these strange and beautiful bands.\nDads - If Your Song Has the Word \"Beach\" In It, I'm Not Listening To It.\nDads - Get To the Beach!\nTigers Jaw - Plane vs. Tank vs. Submarine\nA Great Big Pile of Leaves - Alligator Bop\nEveryone Everywhere - Obama House, Fukai Prefecture\nThe World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid To Die - Picture of a Tree That Doesn't Look Okay\nJoie de vivre - High School Me Would Have Been Pumped\nDikembe - Scottie Spliffen\nYou Blew It! - Award of the Year Award\nFake Problems - Complaint Dept.\nChumped - Hot 97 Summer Jam\nAndrew Jackson Jihad - Getting Naked, Playing with Guns\nRestorations - Adventure Tortoise\n","Title":"The Verge Playlist: the weird nomenclature of the pop-punk and emo revivals | The Verge","Tags":["culture","the-verge-playlist","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3834807"]}
