He took to the field at Comerica Park on Tuesday night to toss out the ceremonial first pitch of a game that pitted the Tigers against the Toronto Blue Jays. Despite appearing before a hometown crowd, RoboCop drew an altogether tepid response from spectators. Maybe that shouldn't have surprised anyone. This isn't the same half-man, half-machine that will soon be  immortalized by way of a statue in Detroit's streets. This isn't the RoboCop that's forever linked to the city.\nIn all seriousness, whoever was inside the costume probably could've put a bit more effort into the whole thing. Instead, he walked to the mound like your average Joe and threw a pitch that won't break velocity records anytime soon \u2014 though he did keep it over the plate.  Better than 50 Cent , sure, but still not the blistering four-seamer we'd expect from RoboCop. Even the commentators called out the weak toss. \"I don't think he used his real RoboCop powers for that pitch,\" said one. A motorcycle from the 2014 reboot was also on display at Comerica, all in celebration of RoboCop's arrival on DVD and Blu-ray. As for the original, silver-clad hero that this RoboCop replaced? When it came time to make public appearances, he was  more of a pro wrestling guy .\n","Title":"RoboCop throws a disappointing first pitch | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
