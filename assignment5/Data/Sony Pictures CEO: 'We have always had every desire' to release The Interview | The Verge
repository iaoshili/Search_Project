{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you ask President Obama, Sony made a \" mistake \" by canceling The Interview's release \u2014 but that doesn't mean the movie is gone for good. CNN has just run a quick teaser of Fareed Zakaria's interview with Sony Pictures CEO Lynton (emphasis ours):\n\"When it came to the crucial moment when the threat came out from what was called the [Guardians of Peace] at the time threatening audiences who would go to movie theaters the movie theater came to us one by one over a very short period of time we were completely surprised by it and announced that they would not carry the movie. At that time we had no alternative not to proceed with the theatrical release on December 25th. We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down. We have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie.\"\nAccording to a tweet from Zakaria, the interview wrapped up after Obama's press conference. What isn't discussed, at least in this teaser, is when or how Sony Pictures would release the the film. More so, the focus here feels like Lynton shifting more blame on the theaters for the canceled premiere.\nRead next: Sony says no online service has \"stepped forward\" to distribute The Interview\nIn a later teaser, Lynton reacted to Obama's comment that he wished Sony had reached out to them. \"We definitely spoke to a senior advisor in the White House to talk about the situation. The fact is, did we talk to the president himself? ... The White House was certainly aware of the situation.\" (Even CNN's on-air anchor described that answer as \"muddled.\")\nJust finished an extraordinary interview with Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. Amazing story. Interview airs Sunday 10 am + 1pm on CNN\nCNN will air the entire Lynton interview tonight at 8PM on Anderson Cooper 360.\nJake Kastrenakes contributed to this report.
