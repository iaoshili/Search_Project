{"Main text":"Furious 7 breaks box office records with explosive opening weekend\nNew movie becomes the ninth biggest opening of all time\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe recently released Furious 7 isn't just the most ridiculous entry in the fourteen-year-old Fast and Furious franchise \u2014 it's also become by far the biggest opening weekend earner in the entire series. This weekend saw Furious 7 take $384 million worldwide , with $143.6 million of that coming from the domestic audience. That makes it not only the biggest April opening weekend of all time \u2014 previous record holder Captain America: The Winter Soldier got a comparatively paltry $95 million \u2014 but the ninth biggest opening weekend of all time.\nTo put that in perspective, that's more than every single movie in the Twilight saga, more than Sony's first Spider-Man movie, and far more than every single Star Wars movie got on their first weekends. Furious 7's domestic launch was the biggest since 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the sixth biggest movie launch in US history, which raked in $158 million on its first weekend.\nFurious 7 got more money than every single Twilight movie\nThe rest of the top ten is dominated by superhero movies \u2014  fitting, given that Furious 7 follows exactly the same template . The newest movie is certainly bigger and brasher than previous outings (amazing such a thing was actually possible), but keeping track of fifteen years of increasingly wacky antics from Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and the sadly departed Paul Walker was a tricky task for  first-time Furious director James Wan . The result  is a bit of a mess , redeemed somewhat by skydiving cars, constant affirmations of family and friendship, and The Rock flexing so hard that he sloughs a protective cast off his arm.\nVerge Video: Every Fast and Furious movie plot in 10 minutes\n","Title":"Furious 7 breaks box office records with explosive opening weekend | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
