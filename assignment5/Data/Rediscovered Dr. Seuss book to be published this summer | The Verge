The manuscript and illustrations for the book were found in a box in Theodor Geisel \/ Dr. Seuss' home in 2013 by his widow Audrey Geisel.\n\"it is hard to make up your mind, but sometimes you just have to do it!\"\nThe book features the same brother and sister that appear in One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, and although plot details are thin on the ground, publishers Random House Children's Books say that the new title will feature (spoiler alert!) a decision-marking process involving pets. \"The tale captures a classic childhood moment \u2014 choosing a pet \u2014 and uses it to illuminate a life lesson: that it is hard to make up your mind, but sometimes you just have to do it!\"\nThe cover for the new Dr. Seuss book. (Random House Children's Books).\nAnd there's more good news for Dr. Seuss fans \u2014 enough material for two more books was  reportedly found in the same box, and Random House say they are working on getting them ready for publication too. Meanwhile, What Pet Should I Get? is already available  for pre-order for $17.99 .\n\"While undeniably special, it is not surprising to me that we found this,\" said Audrey Geisel in a  statement . \"Ted always worked on multiple projects and started new things all the time \u2014 he was constantly writing and drawing and coming up with ideas for new stories. It is especially heartwarming for me as this year also marks twenty-five years since the publication of the last book of Ted's career, Oh, the Places You'll Go!\"\n","Title":"Rediscovered Dr. Seuss book to be published this summer | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
