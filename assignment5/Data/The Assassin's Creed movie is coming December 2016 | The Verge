{"Main text":"The Assassin's Creed movie is coming December 2016\nAnd Channing Tatum will star in a Gambit X-Men film next October\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe good news: 20th Century Fox's Assassin's Creed film is back on track for a theatrical release. The bad news: you're going to have to wait until the end of next year to see it. Fox said today that the film, based on Ubisoft's popular video games and starring Michael Fassbender, will arrive in theaters December 21st, 2016. The film was originally scheduled for August 7th this year, but was pushed back late last year.\nAlongside the change, Fox dated its new X-Men spinoff Gambit \u2014 which is set for a release Oct. 7th, 2016 \u2014 while announcing that Channing Tatum will be playing card-shooting mutant Remy LeBeau. His character first appeared in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but was played by Canadian actor Taylor Kitsch.\nHow do you say October 7, 2016 in Cajun?\n\u2014 Channing Tatum (@channingtatum) January 6, 2015\nFox also rejiggered its lineup for the Planet of the Apes and Fantastic Four sequels slated for summer 2017. The new unnamed Apes film will debut July 14th, 2017 (instead of July 29th), and Fantastic Four 2 will come a tad earlier on June 2nd, 2017 instead of July 14th.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
