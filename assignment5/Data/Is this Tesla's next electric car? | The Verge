But you might not need to wait that long to see Tesla's next vehicle \u2014 a picture that apparently showed the new car  appeared last night on the Tesla Motors Club forum .The photo shows a previously unseen black \"Model S P85D.\" Tesla already sells Model S P85 vehicles, suggesting that the new addition to the range would be a step up in terms of performance.\nThere's no confirmation that the photo is real, but its EXIF data shows it was snapped on an iPhone 5S, and you can see the photographer clearly if you zoom in on the car's reflective chrome nameplate \u2014 a tricky Photoshop job to pull off. There's also no details of the car's specifications, its differences to the existing Tesla models available, or the price it'll be available for. Expect those to be gaps to be filled in by Musk when he shows off his D \u2014 and more \u2014 next week.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
