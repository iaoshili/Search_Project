{"Main text":"Apple doesn't want to talk about the real use for the Apple Watch\nExplaining what the watch is for means admitting that phones can be a burden\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYesterday Tim Cook  showed off all the things you can do with an Apple Watch. You can transmit your heartbeat and open your garage door; you can summon an Uber and peruse Instagram. Basically, you can do a lot of the things you can do on your phone, but on your wrist. That seems nice but doesn\u2019t really answer the question of why you\u2019d spend a few hundred dollars (or more) for a device that does the same things as the device in your pocket. Apple\u2019s challenge was to present a compelling use case for the watch, and it mostly failed to. \"It still feels like an awful lot of interesting ideas without a unifying theme,\" Nilay wrote after testing the watch.\nUpdate: Read our  Apple Watch review .\nThe thing is, the watch does have a use case, it's just one that\u2019s hard for Apple to talk about. Last week Matthew Panzarino at TechCrunch wrote that the best thing about the watch, according to the Apple employees who\u2019ve been demoing it, was that it let them basically stop using their phone. Instead of fishing their phones out of their pockets every couple minutes, they could check incoming notifications on the watch and choose to ignore or respond to them. Panzarino imagined a future where the watch helps us be less distracted and more present.\nThere is a case for the watch, but it's hard for Apple to talk about\nBut how do you get up on stage and say that the best thing about this new gadget is that it lets people use this other gadget, the one you spent the last eight years turning into a fetish object, less frequently? Of course you still need an iPhone for the Apple Watch, so it\u2019s not like the watch threatens to replace the phone \u2014 but rhetorically it\u2019s a tricky argument to make. You\u2019d have to acknowledge that people can have fraught relationships with their phones , and that their attachment to them is deeply ambivalent. True, I feel relief when I check my phone and anxious when its battery dies, but that\u2019s a very different type of obsession than the sort Apple encourages in its lavish videos of cold-forged steel watch cases. It\u2019s much more compulsive and dependent. Making the best pitch for the watch would mean acknowledging that devices can be burdens, not just tools for empowerment.\nIt\u2019s also a paradoxical case to make. How do you tell people who feel queasy about being too immersed in their phones that the solution is buying another device that they physically strap onto their body and buzzes them whenever they get a message? Do you feel too plugged-in? Maybe you\u2019re just not plugged in enough! Cook\u2019s statement that the watch is \"not just with you, it's on you\" is both appealing \u2014 no need to compulsively reach for our phone \u2014 and ominously oppressive, depending on how you feel about your phone's incessant pings.\nDevices can be burdens, not just tools for empowerment\nAnd of course there\u2019s the strong possibility that the watch won\u2019t free you from your devices \u2014 instead, it\u2019ll do exactly the opposite. Will you really stop twitchily checking to see if you might have missed something, or will a screen that\u2019s less of a hassle to glance at only make it an easier itch to scratch? Will you be able to relax in between pings, or will you exist in a constant state of anticipation and half-distracted awareness ? At least now you can put your phone on silent and turn it face down if you want to log off for a bit; a watch is always on \u2014 and \"on you,\" as Cook said \u2014 at least when it\u2019s not charging . Moreover, if the watch becomes the norm, everyone will know you received their text, snap, or mention and expect you to reply immediately. Now a delayed reply might mean you didn\u2019t hear your phone; with a watch, it means you\u2019re just being rude.\nI\u2019m willing to entertain the possibility that a wearable device could alleviate some technological anxieties \u2014 in fact, I think it\u2019s the strongest case for them \u2014 but I can also imagine plenty of cases where it makes all these problems far worse, which is just another reason for Apple to stay away from the subject.\nVerge Video: Initial takeaways from the introduction of the Apple Watch\n","Title":"Apple doesn't want to talk about the real use for the Apple Watch | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech","essay","apple-watch-spring-event-2015"]}
