{"Main text":"How did Orion withstand temperatures twice the melting point of steel?\nMeet Molly White, the engineer who helped make it possible\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn Florida, at the Kennedy Space Center, Molly White is cheering with her sister. Today the two space enthusiasts watched gleefully as the Orion spacecraft rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, circled Earth twice, and splashed down off the coast of Baja California in the Pacific Ocean at 10:29AM Eastern. A product of years of work and anticipation, the uncrewed Orion Exploration Test Flight-1 took exactly 4 hours and 24 minutes. And White, an aerospace engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was crucial to making it all work.\nMolly White, left, and her sister Emma at  the Kennedy Space Center causeway viewing area just before launch.

And when it went off it was so loud, so huge. It was just amazing.\"\nWhite is one of the many researchers responsible for Orion\u2019s heat shield. This reflective, flammable blanket is crucial to the spacecraft\u2019s ultimate mission: sending humans to Mars and bringing them back safely. It\u2019s been White\u2019s job since 2010 to predict temperature and airflow around the heat shield during takeoff and landing.\nShe\u2019s been counting down to today for months. \"These last few days have just been watching, waiting, and getting more and more excited,\" she says. Yesterday, the intended launch was repeatedly delayed by stray boats, wind gusts, and technical problems \u2014 and that was \"a bit of an emotional roller coaster,\" she says. \"It goes to show you so many things have to go right for a space launch \u2013 the weather, all of the systems, the rocket, as well as the payload.\"\n\"I\u2019ll be high off of this for a few weeks,\" she says. Like a lot of kids, she wanted to work for NASA. As a little girl she admired her grandfathers, who were both engineers. In school she excelled in math and science and started to love space after a middle school project on the cosmos. She studied aerospace engineering, hoping to work on spaceflight. \"Part of me thought it was a pipe dream,\" she says, \"something I\u2019d never get to work on.\"\nThe first day on her dream job was actually a let-down. On February 1, 2010 \u2014 her first day \u2014 NASA\u2019s Constellation program, the George W. Bush-era plan to return humans to the moon via Ares I and Ares V rockets, was cancelled. \"I had been brought on to help with Constellation, so I was a bit nervous,\" White says. Her boss assured her though that something new and cool would be coming her way. She\u2019s worked on Orion ever since.\nthe first day of her dream job at nasa was actually a let-down. the project she had been hired for was cancelled.\nToday\u2019s test flight is crucial for her to continue her work. After all the data is recovered White and her team will have a lot of work to do evaluating how well their predictions stacked against the harsh reality of space.\nThe largest-ever heat shield is installed on Orion.

You can\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, right?\"\nApollo 11 spacecraft with parachutes deployed, on its way to splashdown after returning from the moon in 1969 ( USS Hornet )\nNASA has sent humans beyond Earth many times, notably during 11 Apollo moon missions between 1968 and 1972. But Orion is to be the most ambitious crewed mission to date, representing a renewed hunger for space exploration. This spacecraft is meant to travel farther, faster, and carry more astronauts than ever before, and it\u2019s hoped that Orion will be the safest space vehicle built to date. If all goes according to schedule, Orion will put humans on an asteroid by 2025 and on Mars in the 2030s. Here\u2019s how crazy it all is: in June, a blue-ribbon panel issued a highly critical report, questioning whether the agency was currently on the right track. The congressionally charted Committee on Human Spaceflight suggested focusing more exclusively on reaching Mars. In response, NASA essentially yawned .\norion could put humans on an asteroid by 2025 and ON MARS IN 2030-2040\nOrion bears a striking resemblance to the Apollo crafts, and that\u2019s no mistake. \"The theme of Orion is recreating Apollo with 21st century modern technology,\" says John Balboni, an engineer at the NASA Ames Research Center. Balboni has worked in the arc jet test facility for the past 30 years, testing heat-shielding materials in a plasma wind-tunnel.\nA view of Earth from Orion's first orbit.

The engineers who created materials such as the Apollo heat shield left documentation, but few of them are around anymore. \"It\u2019s like trying to make a cake from your grandmother\u2019s recipe,\" he says. \"She could leave you all the ingredients and all the steps, but you\u2019re not going to make a cake as good as your grandmother made.\"\nThat\u2019s not all. In the decades since the Apollo missions, new materials, such as high-temperature ceramics, have been invented and some old materials have been improved. Other components used years ago, such as asbestos, were phased out after they were found to be toxic. For Orion\u2019s shield NASA redeveloped Avcoat, a combination of fiberglass and high-tech plastics, that was used, in an earlier form, for Apollo\u2019s heat shield.\n\"IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MAKE A CAKE FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE.\"\nThe shield is crucial to the success of the mission because getting humans into and home from deep space requires hurling them around as fast as possible. The faster a craft\u2019s trip through the atmosphere, the more kinetic energy is transferred into heat. A capsule returning from the moon smacks into the atmosphere at about 25,000 miles per hour. The heat shield reaches about 5,000ยบ F at this speed. If Orion makes the return journey from Mars someday, it\u2019ll enter the atmosphere at an estimated 33,500 miles per hour, heating the heat shield to near 5,500ยบ F. The air around it, as it travels in a plasma fireball, is about twice as hot as the surface of the sun.\nThat much heat puts intense stress on materials, and if your heat shield fails, the entire vehicle can be lost. \"We\u2019ve seen failures of the heat shield on the shuttle mission,\" says White. \"Hot gas was able to get inside the structure and cause things to explode and burn up.\" In 2003, space shuttle Columbia disintegrated as some of heat-protective tiles failed just before landing, killing all seven crew members aboard.\nToday, after saying goodbye to Florida, Orion sped through the atmosphere. On the surface of the craft, the noise was estimated to be about 100 times louder than a rock concert. Orion circled the earth twice, reaching as high as 3,600 miles on the second loop \u2013 15 times higher than the International Space Station. When Orion slammed back into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (about 30 times the speed of sound) the heat shield survived an estimated 4,000ยบ F. If it worked as intended, about 20 percent of the shield burned up on the way down, further dissipating heat.\n\"the most perfect flight you could imagine.\"\nAfter about five minutes into its ride through the atmosphere, slowing down to about 300 mph, Orion began firing parachutes. These parachutes, 11 in total, unfurled in a multi-stage Kevlar-nylon ballet. With their help, Orion decelerated from 300 mph to just 20 mph in five minutes, slow enough for a graceful splashdown.\n\"It turned out to be the most perfect flight you could imagine,\" said Rob Navias, NASA TV commentator as Orion splashed down.\nThe spacecraft is now floating in the water, soon to be recovered by two US Navy ships. The USS Anchorage will collect the crew module, while the salvage ship, the USNS Salvor, will recover jettisoned hardware like parachutes and the forward bay cover, which protects the upper part of the spacecraft.\nI get a text from Molly just after the splashdown. \"\"We made it!!\" she writes.\nThe precious data White wants is now bobbing in the Pacific, aboard the crew module. More than 1000 sensors aboard Orion recorded conditions during the flight: the stress, vibration, temperature, acceleration, pressure \u2014 all the crucial information to prepare for a flight that will include people. It\u2019s been an exciting day for White. She and her team will spend the day basking in the glow of a successful test. But Monday she goes back to work. After all, Mars is still a long way off.\n","Title":"How did Orion withstand temperatures twice the melting point of steel? | The Verge","Tags":["report","science","transportation\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7102880"]}
