{"Main text":"Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul just released an app called Yo, Bitch\n'Are you baby? SEND A YO B*TCH!'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe ouroboros of internet culture has found a way to eat itself all over. Aaron Paul, best known as Tobey Marshall in  2014's video game adaptation Need for Speed , had at one point played a character in the AMC sitcom Breaking Bad. On that show he had a catchphrase that would put the studio audience in stitches: \"Yo, bitch!\"\nAt the same time,  recall the app Yo , a messaging app where you send people the word \"Yo.\"\nNow, combine the two.\nYo Bitch! To everyone that has ever asked me to call them a bitch, here you go. It's an App Bitch! Happy Holidays. https:\/\/t.co\/CjS1rcSROe\n\u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) December 5, 2014\n\"YB\" is available now in the iTunes App Store. Now, let's be clear exactly what you're getting. This is from the official app description:\nWant to say hello to someone? Say \"Hello, b****!\"\nWant to make your special someone feel loved? Say \"I need you, b****!\"\nFed up with your friend? Say \"Why, b****?\"\nAnd to be absolutely clear, b**** is \"bitch,\" but even in the app, we've only found one instance of the word spelled out \u2014 it's otherwise \"b*tch\" in every instance \u2014 including a $0.99 Socrates Pack that lets you ask important questions like \"HOW? B*TCH,\" \"NOPE, B*TCH!\" and \"YOU SERIOUS, B*TCH!\" (there are more options in the pack and many more packs you can purchase).\nIn all seriousness, we appreciate the novelty of all this, but we're not advising you spend money on a series of b*tches. Maybe if it unlocks the lowercase 'i,' but that's about it.\nAnd now, the best of Jesse Pinkman:\n","Title":"Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul just released an app called Yo, Bitch | The Verge","Tags":["apple","web","apps","culture","tech"]}
