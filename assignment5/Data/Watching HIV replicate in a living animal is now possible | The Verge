A new method for imaging HIV in living macaques is described today in Nature Methods , a feat that had not been previously achieved in large, living animals. The finding is a big deal, because it means that researchers might one day be able to see \u2014 and selectively target \u2014 breeding grounds of HIV in people whose infection is undetectable in blood.\n\"revolutionary for the field of HIV therapeutics.\"\nIf you want to detect HIV in humans, blood is your friend. Unfortunately, the virus levels found in blood aren\u2019t representative of the entire body because replication takes place in the cells located in tissues, not in blood. So, even though blood tests are perfectly adequate for detecting HIV in most people, they don\u2019t always work. People on antiretrovirals sometimes have HIV levels that are so low that doctors can\u2019t detect the virus in the bloodstream. In those cases, HIV continues to replicate in patients' organs, which limits doctors' ability to totally suppress the virus. Doctors could get around that issue by repeatedly sampling tissues at random and testing them for HIV replication \u2014 but doing that would seriously endanger their patients.\nSo, doctors are left with blood tests \u2014 and a bunch of unanswered questions. That\u2019s why designing an imaging technique that can detect hidden pockets of HIV replication without doing anything too invasive is so important; it\u2019s the missing methodological step that could help us figure out where HIV hides out in the body, and why it\u2019s so damn persistent. \"Total body imaging of sites of viral infections\u2026 will be revolutionary for the field of HIV therapeutics,\" \u2014 especially for therapies that focus on virus eradication and HIV remission, says Deborah Persaud, an HIV researcher at Johns Hopkins University who didn\u2019t participate in the study.\nThe images show HIV \"hotspots\" where the virus is making copies of itself\nIn the study, researchers engineered a tracer labelled with radioactive copper that selectively attaches to a protein that\u2019s only expressed on the surface of cells that produce HIV. Then, the researchers injected the tracer in macaques infected with SIV, the monkey form of HIV. They did the same thing with monkeys who had been on antiretrovirals for five weeks, and whose virus was undetectable. Approximately one day later, the researchers put the monkeys through a machine called a PET scan that can detect the low-level radioactivity coming from the tracer. The resulting images show HIV \"hotspots\" where the virus is making copies of itself \u2014 areas that researchers might one day be able to target therapeutically.\nResults for an SIV-infected rhesus macaque (left) and an uninfected macaque (right).

But \"that doesn\u2019t seem to be so,\" he says.\nThe researchers were also surprised to find important pockets of replication in the nose \u2014 in addition to signals in expected areas of replication like the gastrointestinal tract, the genital tract, and the lungs. \"I don\u2019t think it plays a role in transmission, but it\u2019s interesting,\" Villinger says. \"We found signals [in locations] that nobody has paid attention to.\"\nThe nose probably doesn't play a role in transmission, \"but it\u2019s interesting.\"\nThe technique isn\u2019t as sensitive as the researchers would like it to be. The tracer can still be detected organs that don\u2019t experience replication because it\u2019s in the process of being eliminated by these tissues. To get rid of these \"background signals,\" the researchers injected non-HIV infected monkeys with the [tracer], and imaged them as well. Then, they subtracted their signals from those detected in HIV injected macaques. It worked out pretty well, Villinger says. But this correction isn\u2019t ideal, as it might still lead to false positives, says Mathias Lichterfeld an HIV researcher at Harvard University who didn\u2019t participate in the study. The researchers may be able to improve the sensitivity of the image by fiddling with the tracer \u2014 a crucial step in \"getting the technique to a point where it can be used in humans,\" Lichterfeld says. Making the images more precise will also help the researchers image infected animals without using uninfected animals to exclude background effects.\nThe images also fall short when it comes to the brain. The tracer doesn\u2019t penetrate the \"blood-brain-barrier\"\u2014 a selectively permeable barrier that separates the body\u2019s blood from the central nervous system. As a result, the images don\u2019t show viral replication in the brain, even though it\u2019s probably taking place there too. This is unfortunate because a method that can detect replication in the central nervous system \"is critically needed,\" Persaud says.\nthe technique might not work in children who have been \"functionally cured\" of HIV\nThere\u2019s one last issue with the method devised by Villinger\u2019s team: it probably can\u2019t detect latent HIV reservoirs, meaning pockets of HIV where replication doesn\u2019t take place. This is a rare occurrence, but it does happen. In 2013, doctors announced that treating a baby with antiretrovirals right after birth had \" functionally cured \" the child of HIV; the virus remained undetectable after the child was taken off the drugs. Unfortunately, the virus returned a year later. And unfortunately, the protein to which the tracer binds isn't expressed in latent HIV reservoirs, Persaud says.\nLittle known about what happens in the first two weeks after infection\nNow that the study has been published, Villinger and his team of researchers want to tweak the tracer to make the images more accurate. They also want to see if they can detect differences in HIV progression in animals infected intravenously \u2014 a model of infection through injection drug use \u2014 and animals infected through tissues in the genital tract. They would also like to measure signals in animals that have been on antiretrovirals therapy for longer periods, as well in animals that have been taken off antiretroviral therapy to see what happens as HIV replication is \"rekindled.\" Villinger and his team have also started to look at what happens in the first two weeks of infection; scientists don't know much about that, he says. Finally, the scientists plan to try the method on humans \u2014 something that could happen in the next five years, Villinger says.\nBeing able to see reservoirs of HIV replication in living animals is a big deal. The system needs to be fine-tuned, and tested for safety, but if there\u2019s progress, it would one day lead to a tool for monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies, Villinger says. And in the meantime, it may give researchers a better idea of how HIV re-ignites in the body.  \"In my mind that might be the most important asset we can use this technology for,\" Villinger says. \"It\u2019s really trying to better define what happens where \u2014 and that\u2019s really critical as we move forward in medicine.\"\n","Title":"Watching HIV replicate in a living animal is now possible | The Verge","Tags":["report","science"]}
