{"Main text":"Xbox Live Gold members can play 'Sunset Overdrive' for free on Saturday\nDownload the game starting at 12:01AM ET\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis Saturday, Microsoft is letting all Xbox Live gold members play Sunset Overdrive for free. All day. And it's the full game; you'll get to experience the acclaimed Xbox exclusive without any restrictions or missing play modes. Multiplayer's included (if you get far enough to unlock it), and your progress will be saved in case you decide to go ahead and purchase the game come 11:59PM on Saturday night. Best of all, you'll be able to earn and keep as many of Sunset Overdrive's achievements as you can rack up in 24 hours \u2014 even if you don't end up buying it.Â  But you probably will . It's one of the very best reasons to own an Xbox One.\nKeep in mind that most new games are huge downloads that can easily span multiple hours. So if you want to maximize your play time, we'd recommend starting the download as soon as Sunset Overdrive turns free on Xbox Live. Kick off the process at 12:01AM ET, and you should be good to go when you wake up Saturday morning. After that, enjoy the insanity, and be prepared to hit the \"buy\" button. This is a pretty fantastic offer on Microsoft's part and something we'd love to see more of in the future.\n","Title":"Xbox Live Gold members can play 'Sunset Overdrive' for free on Saturday | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","gaming","tech"]}
