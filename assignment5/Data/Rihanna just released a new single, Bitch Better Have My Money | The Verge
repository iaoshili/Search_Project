{"Main text":"Rihanna just released a new single, Bitch Better Have My Money\nIt's off her upcoming album\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast night, Rihanna began teasing a new single from her upcoming album \u2014 likely titled R8 \u2014 and this morning, she released super-teasey snippets of the song through the  selfie video app Dubsmash . Now, the entire track, \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" (named after AMG's  1991 album ), is available to stream.\nThe song has Rihanna asserting her place on top, hiatus be damned. She slides over a clattering wind-up beat, stuttering her words in that way that makes big pop songs so good for chanting while driving windows-down through your hometown. R8, which doesn't have a release date yet, will be Rihanna's first LP since 2012's Unapologetic.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
