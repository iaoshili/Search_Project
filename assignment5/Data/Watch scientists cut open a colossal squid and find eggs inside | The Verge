{"Main text":"Watch scientists cut open a colossal squid and find eggs inside\nWarning: not for the squeamish\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEnormous squid have fascinated humankind since some of our earliest recorded seafaring days (see:  the myth of the Kraken ). But it is still rare that we get to see such elusive, majestic creatures up close. Now, anyone with access to YouTube can see what a  770-pound colossal squid ( heavier and shorter than the confusingly similarly named \"giant squid,\" but actually a different species) looks like inside and out. Scientists at  the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and their colleagues from the Auckland University of Technology performed a dissection of an extremely well-persevered dead colossal squid on camera yesterday, cutting into select parts, including its beak and mantle. What they found did not disappoint them.\nIn her last discussion tankside, Kat reveals that our new colossal squid is female & has eggs in its mantle! #squidwatch #sciencelivetepapa\n\u2014 Te Papa (@Te_Papa) September 16, 2014\nThe dissection was live streamed as it occurred, and  the resulting recording is now available it its full three-and-a-half-hour long gory glory (the actual stream begins at 06:57 into the video). Te Papa museum already has  one colossal squid on display \u2014 the most in-tact sample ever recovered \u2014 but scientists specifically avoided carving that one up too much to preserve it for public viewings. Not so with this colossal squid, which first discovered nearly a year ago by fishermen in Antarctica's Ross Sea.
