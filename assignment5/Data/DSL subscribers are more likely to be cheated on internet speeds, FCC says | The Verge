If you're a DSL customer, that's a bad thing \u2014 but if you get your internet another way, you might be happy about it.\nDigital subscriber line or DSL customers are getting actual download speeds that are 91 percent of speeds they pay for during peak hours, the FCC says, while cable, fiber, and satellite customers are getting speeds that are actually faster than advertised.\nCable, fiber, and satellite connections were faster than advertised\nCable customers' speeds were 102 percent of the advertised speed, fiber customers' speeds were 113 percent of the advertised speed, and satellite connections were a whopping 138 percent of the advertised speed. The numbers come from surveys conducted for the agency's annual \"Measuring Broadband America\" report.\nDSL customers may have slower connections because speed depends on the length of the copper wire that connects a customer's house to a provider terminal.\nActual connection speeds are just over the advertised speeds 97 percent of the time on average, the FCC says. But \"consumers deserve to get what they pay for,\" chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. \"While it's encouraging to see that in the past these reports have encouraged providers to improve their services, I'm concerned that some providers are failing to deliver consistent speeds to consumers that are commensurate to their advertised speeds.\"\nThe agency will be sending warning letters to CEOs of companies that do not deliver on advertised speeds, he said.\n","Title":"DSL subscribers are more likely to be cheated on internet speeds, FCC says | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
