{"Main text":"Let's make a 3D-printed Aziz Ansari Iron Man action figure happen\n\"Stark & Recreation\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis weekend, a handful of Walmarts and Sam's Clubs nationwide will set up kiosks where you can get your face scanned and  3D-printed on a Marvel superhero . This is the moment I've been waiting for. Flash back to 15 months ago in downtown New York City, to this beautiful, beautiful picture of It's Aziz Ansari as Iron Man (tagline: Stark & Recreation) signed by  street artist Hanksy (as in, a cross between  Banksy and Tom Hanks).\nSo now, putting the two ideas together, I think there's a chance to make history. Let's make Stark & Recreation happen.\nIf you or someone you love knows Aziz Ansari, please get him this weekend to the nearest participating retailer so that we can start the process of birthing an Aziz Ansari Iron Man action figure. (There's a  Sam's Club in Fountain Valley, CA just outside of Los Angeles.) And if he's busy, what about  Nasim Pedrad ?\nWe as a culture need this.\nOkay, maybe just me.
