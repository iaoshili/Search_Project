{"Main text":"Adobe is suing Forever 21 for pirating Photoshop\nSomeone just got caught shoplifting\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nForever 21 has been pirating Photoshop, according to a new lawsuit from Adobe, and it's facing serious fines as a result.Â  The suit was filed yesterday in California District Court, alleging that Forever 21 pirated 63 different instances of Adobe software including copies of Photoshop, Acrobat, and Illustrator. Autodesk and Corel also joined Adobe in the suit, based on pirated copies of Autodesk, WinZip and PaintShopPro, among others. According to the complaint, Forever 21 \"continued their infringing activities even after being contacted by Adobe regarding the infringement.\"\nIt's not yet clear how Adobe traced back the violations, but it has thoroughly documented them, providing registration numbers and dates for each instance. The result, according to Adobe, is \"willful, intentional, and malicious copyright infringement,\" and they're asking the court to issue an injunction and compensate the companies for lost revenue, court costs, and additional damages. Adobe moved towards cloud-based versions of Photoshop and other software in 2013, and many responded to the shift by seeking out pirated versions of the software . In response, Adobe has actively encouraged employees to turn in employers using unauthorized versions of the software.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
