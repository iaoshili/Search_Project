{"Main text":"You can still buy an Apple Watch in stores this Friday, just not Apple Stores\nSupply extremely limited\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Apple Watch won't be available in the company's own stores until June, and customers who purchased their watch minutes  after pre-orders opened might have to wait until May, but that doesn't mean you won't be able to walk into a store and pick one up this Friday. Select high-end fashion stores in Tokyo, London, Los Angeles, Berlin, Milan, and Paris all appear set to carry the device from Friday, with most stating that Apple Watches will be  available \"in-store 4.24.15.\"\nThe company's head of retail, Angela Ahrendts,  sent an internal memo last week that specified Apple Watch orders  will be online-only for weeks following the device's launch on April 24th, hinting at a shortage of supplies. But you might not have to wait quite so long to get a Watch around your wrist: in addition to the tiny amount of stock on offer in selected stores, Apple  has today contacted people who pre-ordered their devices, in some cases informing them that their purchase would arrive sooner than expected.\nThe supplies are still limited in the selected stores\nFor now, the stores \u2014 each chosen as official sellers of the Watch \u2014 will have very limited supplies. Adrian Joffe, chief executive of Dover Street Market, told The New York Times that his stores in Tokyo and London had around 350 and 570 Apple Watches, respectively. Customers keen to drop $10,000 on the Apple Watch Edition will need to wait a bit longer \u2014 Joffe says the extravagant gold version is on back-order.\n","Title":"You can still buy an Apple Watch in stores this Friday, just not Apple Stores | The Verge","Tags":["apple","business","tech"]}
