{"Main text":"Sony Pictures investigating possible ties between hackers and North Korea\nDoes this have anything to do with Sony's upcoming film 'The Interview'?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony Pictures, whose executives were reportedly  working on chalkboards as recently as yesterday, are investigating a possible connection to North Korea in the  attack that took down their computers earlier this week . Specifically,  according to Recode , the company is \"exploring the possibility that hackers working on behalf of North Korea, perhaps operating out of China.\"\nAs for motivation, Recode speculates one reason could be  The Interview , Sony Pictures' upcoming comedy wherein Seth Rogen and  James Franco play journalists enlisted by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Earlier this year, the North Korean government called The Interview an \" act of war \" and threatened a \"resolute and merciless response\" if the film was released. The film was rumored to be  digitally altered in post-production to remove specific North Korean military insignia, but the main plot still stands.\nNorth Korea couldn't stop us!!! Here's the newest trailer for The Interview!!! http:\/\/t.co\/EAICoJJiFi\n\u2014 Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) November 25, 2014\nIn an email to The Verge from an address associated with the hack, someone who identified as \"lena\" claimed the hackers are working for \"equality\" and that they \" worked with other [Sony] staff with similar interest to get in .\" The hackers, who call themselves \"Guardians of Peace\" and use the hashtag #GOP, shut down all of Sony Pictures' computers, with monitors displaying instead the image of a glowing red skeleton and vague demands. The hackers threatened to release Sony's \"secrets and top secrets\" if the company did not comply with the demands (which the group says Sony was already aware of). The deadline was reportedly this past Monday night; so far, nothing obvious has been released.\nThe Interview, whether or not it's related to this attack, is still currently scheduled for a US release on Christmas Day, December 25th.\n","Title":"Sony Pictures investigating possible ties between hackers and North Korea | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
