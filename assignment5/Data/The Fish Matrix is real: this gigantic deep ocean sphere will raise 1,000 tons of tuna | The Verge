According to West Hawaii Today, 1,700 people signed a petition opposing the sphere, and 400 more wrote letters opposing the extension of construction deadlines in 2012. \"The bottom line is the benefit does not outweigh the risks, no matter what kind of fish they plan to grow,\" Diane Kanealii of theKailapa Community Association in Kawaihae told the paper, while Rob Parsons of Food & Water Watch is quoted calling it a \"factory feedlot in our ocean.\"\nThat's probably not going to stop HOT, which thinks the global market for deep sea fish farming equipment  will be worth $75 billion by 2020 , according to Fish Information & Services. \"The deep ocean is the only place left to produce enough seafood naturally to feed the world efficiently, economically and with minimal environmental impact,\" Spencer  told Big Island Now . \"Our primary goal is technology.\"\nIt is not clear if the fish will be given the choice between blue and red pills.\n","Title":"The Fish Matrix is real: this gigantic deep ocean sphere will raise 1,000 tons of tuna | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech"]}
