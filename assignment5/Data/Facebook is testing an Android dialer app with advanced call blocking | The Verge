{"Main text":"Facebook is testing an Android dialer app with advanced call blocking\nComing back Home\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFacebook Home may have  ended in failure , but the company is still looking at ways to take over your smartphone.  Android Police reports on the existence of a new, Android-only dialer app that \"shows you info about who's calling and automatically blocks calls from commonly blocked numbers.\" The app, called Phone, is marked \"FB-only,\" suggesting it made it into the wild a little early. Facebook confirmed the app's existence to  VentureBeat . \"We are always testing things and have nothing to announce at this time,\" the company said.\n(Android Police)\nFacebook Home \u2014 which is still available, though it  hasn't been updated in a year \u2014 marked an ambitious effort to put the social network, rather than apps, at the heart of your smartphone experience. It replaced your phone's lockscreen and homescreen with the News Feed, and turned your phone's contacts into \"Chat Heads\" that remained on the screen to interact with until you dismissed them. Fewer than 5 million people downloaded it.\nA dialer could represent a new strategy for putting Facebook at the system level of Android phones. Or it could be a one-off experiment. Perhaps we'll hear more at the company's developer conference, F8, which takes place next week in San Francisco.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
