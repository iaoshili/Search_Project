{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine star Andy Samberg will host this year's 67th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Television Academy announced today. The man behind The Lonely Island, Saturday Night Live's digital shorts, and the actually awesome \"Everything is Awesome\" dance number at the Oscars, is already promising to spice up the show, and has done it in the form of a dad joke.\n\"Buckle your seat belts.\"\n\"Buckle your seat belts, Emmy viewers!,\" Samberg said in a statement . \"Like, in general you should buckle your seat belts in your car. In fact, even if you're not an Emmy viewer, you should buckle your seat belt. It can be dangerous on the road. Also, if you're not an Emmy viewer, you should strongly consider becoming one this year, because I'm hosting, and it's gonna be a wild ride. So buckle your seat belts.\"\nLast year's show was hosted by fellow SNL alum Seth Meyers, and was the second-highest viewed Emmys broadcast ever. The often goofy and unbuttoned Samberg could build on that with the type of wonderful volatility many have come to expect from comedian hosts.\nThe ceremony is being held at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles, and will air live on Fox on Sunday, September 20th beginning at 8PM ET. The Television Academy plans to announce the Emmy nominations on July 16th.\n","Title":"Andy Samberg tapped to host the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
