{"Main text":"The next iPhone could be pink and have a pressure-sensing screen\nForce Touch and a new color may come later this year\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple is planning to release new iPhones later this year with Force Touch-equipped displays, according to The Wall Street Journal . Force Touch was one of the key themes at Apple's event on Monday ; the Apple Watch uses the pressure-sensing technology to detect how hard a user is pushing on the screen, and it's also been integrated into the new MacBook and refreshed MacBook Pro's trackpads. On the Apple Watch, Force Touch allows for more input options considering the small size of the screen, while the new MacBook uses it to simulate a traditional mouse click, among other things.\nThe new phones are unlikely to differ too dramatically in design from the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus; Apple almost always keeps its phone bodies around for two years, and the WSJ says that the company's plan is to keep the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen sizes and \"similar\" resolutions. But there could be one very visible change \u2014 Apple is reportedly testing a pink option to go alongside the silver, gold, and space gray models. As ever, these reports are couched in caveats that Apple's plans may change, but mass production for some components is said to start in May.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
