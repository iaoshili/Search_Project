The movie's director, Richard Linklater, also scooped the Golden Globe for best director for his work on the movie, which stars Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as the parents of a young boy and follows his growth from six-year-old to college freshman.  Linklater filmed the movie across a 12-year period starting in 2002, eschewing CGI effects to age his actors, preferring instead to wait for star Ellar Coltrane to grow up naturally.\nBoyhood beat out competition from Foxcatcher, Selma, The Imitation Game, and Stephen Hawking biopic The Theory of Everything for the award. Earlier in the night, The Grand Budapest Hotel, directed by Wes Anderson won the show's other best picture award for a comedy or musical.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
