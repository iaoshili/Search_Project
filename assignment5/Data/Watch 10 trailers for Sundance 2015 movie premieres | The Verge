If you're not at the festival, chances are you won't be able to see any of these movies until later this year, but trailers are being put out there now to help them start building buzz. And chances are, you'll start hearing quite a bit about some of them. Many of each year's biggest films premiere at Sundance, so pay attention if you want to know what's going to be talked about in the film world over the next several months.\nDope\nDope is about how a geek handles the hard streets. It looks like this movie brings some serious attitude, and it's already getting some buzz from the fact that rapper A$AP Rocky plays a role. Also, Bitcoin is involved somehow.\nThe Hunting Ground\nThe issue of rape on college campuses is starting to get the attention it deserves, and the documentary The Hunting Ground plans to keep it in the spotlight. The film speaks with survivors and investigates how colleges are dealing with \u2014 and covering up \u2014 recurring issues of sexual assault.\n3½ Minutes\nAnother documentary at this year's festival that's ripped out of the current headlines, 3½ Minutes is about a brief encounter at a gas station that led to the killing of an unarmed black teenager. The trailer alone is extremely powerful, so this may be a big one once it premieres.\nTrue Story\nYes, it stars James Franco and Jonah Hill, but True Story has the two actors across from one another in dramatic roles. The film is adapted from the memoir of journalist Michael Finkel, who's contacted by an alleged murderer that wants to get his story out.\nChorus\nA beautiful, black-and-white drama that's sure to satiate your French New Wave cravings, Chorus is about a separated couple reuniting when their son's body is found years after his disappearance.\nPrincess\nThe trailer for Princess is seriously creepy (in part because of the abusive relationships that it hints at), but it also hints at the film's blurring of role play, fantasy, and reality, which is supposed to play a big part in the narrative. It's certainly looks like some intriguing storytelling.\nH.\nH. has been getting a lot of buzz off of its mysterious first trailer. It's not entirely clear what's going on here \u2014 something about a meteor crashing to Earth \u2014 but it looks deeply moody.\nThe Visit\nHow would the United Nations handle our first contact with aliens? The Visit is a documentary-style sci-fi film imagining exactly that.\nPartisan\nThe trailer for Partisan is short but terrifying: the film is about a boy who's a trained assassin beginning to go out into the world.\nRacing Extinction\nThe director of The Cove is back with a new documentary about mankind's impact on the planet and the potential for another mass extinction. Racing Extinction looks into black markets for endangered animals and how the ocean is being harmed. Also, Elon Musk shows up at some point.\n","Title":"Watch 10 trailers for Sundance 2015 movie premieres | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
