{"Main text":"FlapIt is the retro social media counter you've always wanted\nTaking social media back a few decades\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn an era of rampant social media obsession, FlapIt has found a way to bring a little flair to tracking your social stats. With a design based on the iconic split-flap clocks of the '60s. Debuting at CES, FlapIt's eponymous product will track your social media follows, likes, and subscriptions. The counter works in a number of languages and, with space for seven characters, can display whatever message you like.\nThe counter is controlled via FlapIt's website \u2014Â all you need to do is connect FlapIt to the same network as your phone or computer. FlapIt is targeting its product at startups and small businesses, who can display messages to customers, but it's only a matter of time before it pops up in a post from the social media star you hate-follow.\nAs far as social media counters go, FlapIt has built one of the best I've seen. It's only slightly egotistic if you own it, thanks to the excellent analog design. If you don't mind wearing that badge, you can buy FlapIt for $299 beginning in April.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
