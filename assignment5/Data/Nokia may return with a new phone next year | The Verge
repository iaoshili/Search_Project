{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt\u2019s been nearly a year since  Microsoft acquired Nokia\u2019s phone business , and rumors suggest the Finnish company may be plotting a return to selling phones.  Recode reports that Nokia is planning to return to the consumer mobile market as early as next year, citing two sources briefed on Nokia\u2019s plans. It\u2019s not clear exactly how Nokia plans to return, but the company is currently restricted from using the Nokia brand on phones until Q4, 2016. That restriction didn\u2019t stop Nokia from launching an  iPad mini clone running Android software , but it does mean the company has to wait a little longer until it returns to phones.\nNokia also working on a VR project\nMicrosoft is currently  moving away from using the Nokia brand on its range of Lumia devices, but the company does continue to use it for feature phones. Any potential Nokia phone will likely launch in a similar way to the N1 Android tablet, allowing Nokia to partner with a manufacturer and simply brand the hardware. It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s very similar to Polaroid, and  Nokia previously revealed it would license its brand , allowing third-party manufacturers to create products and devices that use the Nokia moniker. Nokia Technologies, a research and incubation team, is allegedly working on the company\u2019s phone plans. The same team helped bring the Nokia N1 Android tablet to life. Recode\u2019s report also claims Nokia has a project related to virtual reality, but there are little details on the company\u2019s plans to compete with Samsung, Facebook, and others.\nRumors of a Nokia return to phones come just days after the company announced its  intention to acquire telecoms equipment company Alcatel-Lucent for \u20AC15.6 billion ($16.6 billion). The deal will further strengthen Nokia's ambitions to compete with Ericsson and provide networking equipment to businesses. Nokia is also reviewing its Here mapping business and may consider selling it off.\n","Title":"Nokia may return with a new phone next year | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
