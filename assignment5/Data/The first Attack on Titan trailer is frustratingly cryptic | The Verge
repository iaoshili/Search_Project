{"Main text":"The first Attack on Titan trailer is frustratingly cryptic\nStill no real preview of the skinless humanoids\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe popular Japanese manga series Attack on Titan is being turned into a live action movie. Successfully recreating a comic book as live action seems like a tough thing to do, especially when it features giant skinless creatures that eat humans just because they can. Unfortunately, the movie's first trailer doesn't reveal much.\nWe see the chest of one Titan for about half a second as it's shoving a writhing human into its mouth, and another one that's largely obscured by a thick plume of smoke. Beyond that, it's mostly explosions and scared faces that get screen time. Ignoring the Titan in the room is one way to get people to go see a movie.\nAttack on Titan has been in production since 2011 and is reportedly set for a  summer release in Japan.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
