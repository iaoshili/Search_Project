{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung's  Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge go on sale in the US today at 12:00PM ET, with the South Korean manufacturer  predicting record sales for its new flagship devices. Samsung certainly needs a boost, with relatively sluggish sales for the Galaxy S5  dragging down its revenue and profit in the last quarter . However, after  positive reviews across the board for the S6 and S6 Edge, some analysts are expecting the new devices to sell as many as 50 million units in 2015 alone. \"We expect the sales volume to hit the highest record ever among the Galaxy series,\"  said Lee Sang-chul , Samsung's head of mobile marketing.\nSamsung says demand for the s6 Edge is outstripping supply\nSamsung also seems bullish about the prospects of the S6 Edge. The company's head of mobile, JK Shin,  told press that demand for the Edge was outstripping supply, thanks to both increased orders from carriers and the difficulty of manufacturing  the Edge's curved screen . Of course, not being able to keep up with demand does not necessarily mean that demand is exceptionally high \u2014 it says more about launch inventory than future sales \u2014 but even a relatively small number of extra sales for the S6 Edge would be good news for Samsung thanks to its higher price point (an extra $100).\nAlthough the S6 and S6 Edge go on sale today in the US, UK, Germany, and France, customers in other markets \u2014 especially in Asia and Africa \u2014 will have to wait  at least a week to get their hands on one. To add to the fanfare of the occasion, Samsung says it will be \" rolling out the S carpet \" for the devices, with certain venues offering customers the opportunity to transfer data from their old phone to their new one on the spot.\nVerge Video: Samsung Galaxy S6 review\n","Title":"Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge go on sale as Samsung predicts record shipments | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","business","tech"]}
