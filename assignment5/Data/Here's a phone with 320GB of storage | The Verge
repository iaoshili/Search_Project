{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's not necessary to say something is \"great on paper.\" Saygus has created what it's called a \"super smartphone,\" and in many ways it feels like they looked at a spec sheet and said, \"we can make this look really good.\"\nThe Saygus V2 has a 5-inch, 1080p display and features a 2.5GHz quad core Snapdragon processor with 3GB RAM, powering Android 4.4.4 KitKat. Saygus says the V2 designed for the media junkie, which is to say it boasts up to 320GB of storage \u2014 64GB internal with two MicroSDXC slots. It's got a 21-megapixels rear (with dual-LED flash) and 13-megapixel front-facing camera. The V2 also has Harman Kardon speakers, a biometric fingerprint scanner, built-in Wireless Qi charging, root access for developers... look, there's a lot to love in this phone. The design isn't particularly inspired, but the frame is fairly small and robust.\nThe big question is pricing, which Saygus says will be \"competitive with other 5-inch devices\" but won't elaborate. As for availability, the V2's press release notes that it's \"working to distribute its V2 through all US carriers, and most of the carriers across the globe\" and is targeting release this spring. ButÂ  as Engadget notes , its first (and only other) phone was marred by certification delays, so while the V2 is great on paper, we'll have to see if it learns from the past and can get its device in front of the right people.\n","Title":"Here's a phone with 320GB of storage | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
