{"Main text":"Sony announces the Xperia Z4 flagship smartphone in Japan\nNo compact edition or international release date\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony has announced the Xperia Z4 , its latest flagship smartphone, in its home country of Japan. Like the Z4 Tablet announced at Mobile World Congress last month, the Z4 isn't a dramatic departure from earlier Xperia devices like last fall's Z3 .\nThe Z4's 6.9-mm-thick, 144g metal-and-glass body is very much in line with the company's prior design language, and houses a 5.2-inch 1080p LCD screen, a 20.7-megapixel camera, a 2930mAh battery, a 2GHz 8-core 64-bit Snapdragon 810 processor, and 3GB of RAM. The phone runs Android 5.0 Lollipop and is water- and dust-resistant. Unlike the Z3, no smaller \"Compact\" edition has been announced.\nAs yet there's no word on a release in other regions, but if you've been waiting on a new Sony flagship phone despite the company's mobile troubles , know that there's one coming soon to at least some parts of the world. The Z4 will be out in Japan this summer with white, black, copper, and \"aqua green\" color variants available.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
