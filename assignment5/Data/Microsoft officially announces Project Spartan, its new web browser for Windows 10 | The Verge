{"Main text":"Next\nThere's also a new reading mode that strips away the clutter of a page and makes it more like reading a book \u2014 it's a feature that Apple has offered for a while in Safari on both the Mac and on iOS devices, and we're definitely glad to see it make its way to another browser now. There's also a reading list that syncs across all your devices, much like Pocket, Instapaper, and the Reading List already found in Safari.\nNaturally, Cortana will be integrated into Project Spartan, as well. It'll pop up on relevant pages where Cortana can be useful \u2014 for example, if you're on a restaurant's webpage, Cortana will be right there to give you directions, show you its hours and contact info, and link you out to Open Table for a reservation. It also can easily pull up things like flight reservations \u2014 if you type \"Delta\" in the address bar, it'll know if you have a flight booked and can show your the details.\nAll in all, Project Spartan looks like a nice step forward for Microsoft's web browsing experience, though there aren't any details yet on whether the browser will support extensions, as rumored. It's also not clear if Project Spartan will become the next Internet Explorer or whether its browser will finally be rebranded \u2014 we'll have to wait until we get closer to the launch of Windows 10 to know for sure.\n","Title":"Microsoft officially announces Project Spartan, its new web browser for Windows 10 | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7630402"]}
