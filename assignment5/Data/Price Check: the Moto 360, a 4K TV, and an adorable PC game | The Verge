{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWelcome to Price Check, our weekly post dedicated to sorting through all the new products and deals that we find. We also get a ton of gadgets sent to our office, so consider this the best place for us to tell you about them and where you can find them \u2014 sometimes even for cheap.\nMoto 360 at Best Buy ($220)\nThe best-looking Android Wear watch in the eyes of many is the Moto 360. (Some of us do really like the look of LG's G Watch R, though.) It's a beautiful piece of technology that works well when you need it, but stays out of the way when you don't. Forcing a squared-off OS to fit on a round screen doesn't always produce a great experience, and it doesn't have the battery life of a Pebble \u2014 in our time with it we had trouble keeping it alive over the course of a full day. If you're looking to get in the smartwatch game the Moto 360 should be one of your top options, especially when it's on sale. But remember, the release of the Apple Watch is right around the corner.\nSamsung 50-inch 4K TV at Amazon ($997)\n4K televisions have so quickly become the standard that prices are dropping precipitously. Just look at this 50-inch set from Samsung, for example, which Amazon is selling for $500 off the retail price. If you want to be a not-so-early adopter (an on-time adopter?), this could be the 4K television for you. We learned at CES how messy the 4K content delivery scene currently looks, however, so consider yourself warned .\nGrow Home at Steam ($8)\nThis adorable PC game echoes the classic Super Mario 64, from the swiveling camera that follows the platforming action to the brightly colored polygons. There's even some oversized mushrooms for good measure. Here, the short-statured plumber has been replaced with a stumbly robot that's trying to climb to the stars. The game comes cheap on Steam \u2014 just $8 \u2014 and gets a thumbs up from Polygon and our own Chris Plante.\nTranscend 1 TB external hard drive at Amazon ($65)\nHard drive space is like extra battery power \u2014 you can never have enough of it. Protecting all that data from physical damage is important, so it's a good thing for clumsy people that some companies make external drives with military-grade shock resistance. Amazon has cut $50 off the retail price of Transcend's 1TB model, which is portable and uses USB 3.0, so go forth and make your data redundant.\nProductivity app pack at StackSocial ($60)\nBelieve it or not, some of the most heated discussions at The Verge are about which productivity apps are best. Some of us swear by services like Alfred , others are really into to-do list apps . If you've wanted to try a bunch without paying out the ear for each individual subscription, StackSocial has a deal worth looking at. Evernote, Wunderlist, Pocket, and Dropbox are all popular services with many of us Verge staffers, and you can get access to all of them (and more) for just $60.\n(Affiliate links are automatically generated by our partner, Skimlinks.
