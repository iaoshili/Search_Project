{"Main text":"HugOne will monitor your entire family's sleep\nAnd, hopefully, help you all sleep better\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt seems like everyone wants to sleep better. There are already dozens and dozens of apps and gadgets that can help you do that, but the company Sevenhugs has built a product that's meant to do it for the entire family. Its solution is a hub called HugOne that connects to a number of \"Minihugs\" that monitor each person's sleep. Minihugs are placed on the edge of a bed, and once a person is in it, the sensor will monitor when they fall asleep, if they're rolling over during the night, and when they wake up. All of that information is then relayed to an iOS or Android app.\nThe hub can tell parents when their kids are awake\nWhile none of that is new to sleep sensors, Sevenhugs is specifically targeting families, hoping that parents will use HugOne to see how well their young kids are sleeping. Parents will be able to tell how much sleep their kids are actually getting, receive alerts when their kids wake up, and be notified about when it's a good time to wake a child up based on where they're at in their sleep cycle. The HugOne can also monitor humidity and air quality, and it can connect to a smart thermostat and control temperature based on your preferences.\nThe HugOne is being announced today at CES Unveiled. Unfortunately, the actual product wasn't on display, so the only images of it so far are Sevenhugs' own press images  and YouTube video . Sevenhugs intends to put the device on sale in March. The HugOne hub will sell for $169 and include two Minihugs, with additional Minihugs available for $39 each. Up to six Minihugs can be used at once. If you're really into monitoring your family, now's  a good time to be at CES.\n","Title":"HugOne will monitor your entire family's sleep | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","tech","ces-2015"]}
