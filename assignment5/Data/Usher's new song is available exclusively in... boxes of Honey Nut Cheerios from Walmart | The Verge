Why? Because they're sweet and crunchy and you need to eat them so your heart will be healthy enough for you to dance...or something. And because Honey Nut Cheerios are for now the only way for you to legally get access to Usher's newest single, \"Clueless.\" As  Billboard reported, Walmart today began selling specially marked boxes of the cereal that contain a download code for the latest song from the man who brought us \"Yeah\" and \"Confessions, Part II\" among other smash R&B hits.\nIt's hardly the first time Usher Raymond has done unusual product placement for his new music: anyone remember  Dance Central 3 ? But he's taking this one really far, even appearing in a TV commercial dance-off with the Honey Nut Cheerios mascot, Buzz the Bee, earlier this year (above). \"Usher loves Honey Nut Cheerios and was excited about spreading the word about heart health, so it was just meant to be,\" said  one the General Mills marketing executives who cooked up the plan, presumably while fanning herself with an empty box of Cheerios®.\nUsher had this to say for himself on Twitter.\n\u2014 Usher Raymond IV (@Usher) August 28, 2014\nHey, if this is what some  musicians have to do eat these days*, more power to him.\n","Title":"Usher's new song is available exclusively in... boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios from Walmart | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
