{"Main text":"China bans iPads and MacBooks from government use in clampdown on US companies\nMicrosoft, Symantec, and Qualcomm also targeted as China reduces reliance on foreign companies\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChina\u2019s hostility towards US technology companies is escalating this week with a ban on government use of Apple\u2019s iPads and MacBooks.  Bloomberg reports that up to 10 Apple products have been removed from a Chinese government procurement list last month over security concerns related to their usage. The latest move follows similar bans on products from US firms Microsoft and Symantec.\nMicrosoft\u2019s latest  Windows 8 operating system was banned from Chinese government computers recently, catching the software maker by surprise. Microsoft\u2019s Chinese offices were also  raided recently over monopoly allegations, and a Chinese government agency is also investigating American technology company Qualcomm for potential antitrust issues.\nChinese President Xi Jinping has called for his country to become a technology leader and to develop its own software and technologies. \"Only if core technologies are in our own hands can we truly hold the initiative in competition and development,\" said Jinping in a June meeting. \"Only then can we fundamentally ensure our national economic security, defense security and other aspects of security. We cannot always dress up other people\u2019s yesterdays as our own tomorrows.\"\nUS and China fight over spying allegations\nChina\u2019s increased attention to US companies also follows  months of revelations from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden detailing the US government\u2019s surveillance activities. The  NSA reportedly built backdoors into Chinese telecom giant Huawei's communications equipment, and the  Chinese government has demanded that the US puts an end to its spying practices. The US government has previously labelled Chinese firms Huawei and ZTE as a  risk to national security , highlighting the tensions between the two countries.\n","Title":"China bans iPads and MacBooks from government use in clampdown on US companies | The Verge","Tags":["apple","us-world","tech"]}
