{"Main text":"New 'Transformers' trailer reminds Godzilla there's another monster movie coming\nFire-breathing dinobots will feature in 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMichael Bay's love of explosions and fast-moving action is exhibited in full in the latest  Age of Extinction international trailer released by Paramount. Starring Mark Wahlberg in the place of Shia LaBeouf as the leading human protagonist, the upcoming Transformers movie looks to be as grand and over the top as its three most recent predecessors. At stake is nothing short of the survival of the human race and the weapons for fighting that battle are characteristically enormous, built out of super-advanced materials, and occasionally talkative enough to detail some of the plot as well. And, just as Godzilla hits cinemas around the world, there's a fire-breathing dinobot to look forward to as well.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
