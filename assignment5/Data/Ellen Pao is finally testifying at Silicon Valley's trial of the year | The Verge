{"Main text":"Ellen Pao is finally testifying at Silicon Valley's trial of the year\nWe get to hear her speak!\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor the past two weeks, Ellen Pao has been sitting quietly at the plaintiff\u2019s table while her former colleagues at Kleiner Perkins have painted her as a prickly careerist, ill-equipped for the high-stakes sausagefest of venture capital financing in Silicon Valley. Yesterday, at long last, it was Pao\u2019s turn to speak . She has not disappointed.\nPao is now the CEO of Reddit. She is suing the venture capital firm for $16 million in damages, alleging gender discrimination and retaliation by Ajit Nazre, a Kleiner investor who was fired in 2012 for sexual harassment.\nThe self-assured woman who initially took the stand \u2014 quick with a smile, confident in her responses, literally leaning in to the microphone \u2014 was nothing like the picture her ex-managers conjured of an inexperienced junior partner, who couldn\u2019t command a room . Before their relationship disintegrated, Pao\u2019s mentor at Kleiner, billionaire John Doerr, urged her to use her dry sense of humor. That\u2019s how she came across for most of yesterday, before the trial unraveled into its daily tailspin of performance reviews and emails chains. \n\"Pao\u2019s case rests largely on her own testimony.\"\nThere is lot riding on Pao\u2019s credibility. Many of the headline-grabbing anecdotes from her complaint feel untrustworthy after hearing multiple perspectives. There are only so many versions of joking about porn stars on a private jet before everyone\u2019s motivation seems suspect.\nIn its trial brief, Kleiner\u2019s lawyer Lynne Hermle wrote : \"Pao\u2019s case rests largely on her own testimony\u2014 which is predominantly based on the self-serving notes she wrote throughout her employment that are inadmissible hearsay.\" In other words, Kleiner wants to make the case that she was planning on suing them all along. Hermle's objections like \"triple hearsay\" and \"backdoor hearsay\" make Pao's account seem less believable.\nObjection! Backdoor hearsay!

A lot is \"he said she said he said,\" which poses problems\n\u2014 Marisa Kendall (@MarisaKendall) March 7, 2015\nPao is testifying right now and perhaps tomorrow and still hasn\u2019t been questioned by Kleiner\u2019s attorney, but here are the important revelations from her testimony so far.\nKleiner Perkins repeatedly failed to act on complaints\nAt the center of Pao\u2019s complaint is her relationship with Nazre, who directed some of Pao's work with the green investment team. He allegedly \"pressured her\" into a brief, consensual affair in 2006, which Pao broke off when she found out that he had lied about still being married. When Nazre was fired in 2012, it was for sexually harassing Trae Vassallo, another female partner, not Pao.\nThis is where the retaliation allegations come into play. Pao said over and over on the stand that Nazre \"made it difficult\" for her to do her job by cutting her off from vital information and meetings. Pao also alleges that Kleiner retaliated against her because she would not stop complaining. \nWhen Pao complained, a female partner told her Nazre was \"a sex addict.\"\nYesterday, we learned why she was so relentless. Around the time she contemplated leaving Kleiner in 2007, Pao shared her concerns about Nazre with Juliet de Baubigny, the partner in charge of recruiting who unofficially handled some human resources issues. (At this point, Kleiner had invested in Google, Amazon, and Electronic Arts, but did not have an HR rep.) De Baubigny responded that she thought Nazre was \"a sex addict.\" Pao was surprised. \"It was a strong phrase to use,\" she said in court. Pao spoke with de Baubigny because she heard three administrative assistants dealt with harassment as well. Despite awareness of Nazre's issues, he was soon promoted to senior partner.\n#ellenpao says #kleinerperkins investigator put his pen down when pao was talking about comment she'd heard re: nazre being a \"sex addict\"\n\u2014 Davey Alba (@daveyalba) March 10, 2015\nPao repeatedly said Kleiner did nothing to address her concerns. She brought up Nazre again in a self-review from 2009: \"Because I continued to bring up the issue and Kleiner Perkins continued to do nothing.\" According to Pao, Vassallo complained about Nazre in the summer and winter of 2011, and \"they had done nothing. Twice.\" In fact, she found out about Vassallo's concerns when they went to see COO Eric Keller about other instances of gender bias at Kleiner.\n#EllenPao 's memo \"I know my career has been badly damaged by our firm's failure to have properly addressed these matters\" #KleinerPerkins\n\u2014 Marisa Kendall (@MarisaKendall) March 10, 2015\nHer relationship with Ajit Nazre can\u2019t easily be explained away\nJust before Pao was sworn in, the jury got a reminder of how important her credibility is to her claims. Judge Harold Kahn lets the jury ask follow-up questions, and they never miss a beat. The jury asked Stephen Hirschfeld, the independent investigator who looked into written complaints from Pao and Vassallo in 2012, whether he thought Miss Pao had been completely truthful. Hirschfeld said: \"She was not truthful about the relationship with Ajit Nazre,\" and described her mood as disappointed that he misled her by saying he had separated from his wife. \nOffice power dynamics underscore the need for basic HR policies\nTestimony from Pao made it seem like Nazre badgered her into a relationship and harassed her afterward, but that the affair was consensual. Pao also said she was pressured by partner Ray Lane to let Nazre off easy. Emails show her asking Doerr not to fire him. But those kind of office power dynamics just underscore the need for proper policies.\nAsking the woman facing retaliation from Nazre to weigh in on his fate just highlights how unprofessionally Kleiner behaved. Pao said her requests for an HR seminar went unmet.\n(1\/2) #ellenpao memo to #kleinerperkins : imagine ur wife\/daughter in my position & what it feels like to be deceived & intimidated\n\u2014 Davey Alba (@daveyalba) March 10, 2015\n(2\/2) into having a relationship w\/someone who flouts his seniority\n\u2014 Davey Alba (@daveyalba) March 10, 2015\nPao joined Kleiner to become an investor, not support staff\nPao\u2019s discrimination claim rests on the fact that she was not promoted to senior partner, unlike three of her male colleagues. Kleiner has tried to emphasize that Pao was hired in as a \"chief-of-staff\" for Doerr, working on speechwriting and other behind-the-scenes duties as part of \"Team JD.\" They say she was always destined for an operations role, like the one she has at Reddit right now.\nHowever, Pao explained that she initially turned down Kleiner\u2019s offer because she thought it was too junior. She took the position only after the role was changed to include \"an investing component,\" where she would have \"an opportunity to invest in companies along with [Doerr]\" with the goal of becoming \"an investor at a leading venture capital firm\" like Kleiner. This helps explain Pao\u2019s \"resentment\" at continuing to support \"Team JD,\" while her co-chief-of-staff Wen Hsieh was permitted to dive into the investing side.\nPao implies she tried to save a floundering investment firm\nThere were a few spit-takes during Pao\u2019s testimony yesterday, such as when she mentioned trying to bring a little company called Twitter to the attention of general partner Matt Murphy. Murphy said the team was not business-minded and told her to drop it. Kleiner would later be the laughing stock of Silicon Valley for investing late in Twitter as a showy, expensive attempt to reassert its dominance in digital companies. Pao also said she played a key role in urging Kleiner to invest in other successes, like Bit9 and RPX, although the credit went to her male superiors.\nPao alleges she was denied a board seat at RPX partly because she was about to go on maternity leave and partly because Doerr said Randy Komisar \"needed a win.\" The company buys patents to help other startups fight patent trolls. On the stand, Pao explained that Kleiner was \"nervous because they were worried [RPX] would be viewed as a patent troll itself.\" RPX had a successful IPO in 2011.\nThe testimony in this category will be heavily contested once Kleiner\u2019s lawyer Lynne Hermle gets to grill Pao. But it was impossible not to pick up an air of desperation around Kleiner\u2019s investment strategy during her tenure.\nAs Recode pointed out , Pao worked at Kleiner from 2005 to 2012, during the firm\u2019s \"stagnant era.\" Kleiner secured its status in Silicon Valley with lucrative investments in Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Genentech, and others, but \" aged poorly .\" During the great recession, Kleiner tried to pivot towards investment in China and green-tech. Pao said she urged Kleiner to do more due diligence on green investments because of its inexperience in the field. She also described her role in some of Doerr\u2019s most famous forays into the spotlight, such as the billionaire\u2019s emotional TED talk on climate change in 2007 and his work with President Obama on integrating clean-tech into the economic recovery.\nGreen-tech ended up a blight on Kleiner\u2019s track record. It will be up to Pao\u2019s lawyer to demonstrate that she helped more than she hurt.\n","Title":"Ellen Pao is finally testifying at Silicon Valley's trial of the year | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7972660"]}
