{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Sundance documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck is far from a traditional biopic. Directed by Brett Morgen, the filmmaker behind movies like The Kid Stays in the Picture and the Rolling Stones documentary Crossfire Hurricane, it eschews conventional narrative in an attempt to bring audiences inside the mind of Cobain through his paintings, personal recordings, journals, and some disturbing home video footage. I saw a lot of documentaries at Sundance this year, and Montage of Heck was my favorite by far .\nI sat down with Morgen during the festival to talk about the origins of the project, the absence of Dave Grohl (he appears only in archival footage), and a striking animated sequence which uses Cobain\u2019s recorded recollection of how he lost his virginity and almost committed suicide during his teenaged years.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\nWhen did you hear Nirvana for the first time? Let\u2019s start with you, the fan.\nWell I saw them play my college in 1989. I went to Hampshire college. It was one of the only colleges they played on that tour. Very little memory of it\u2026 And then I saw them at the Forum in \u201893, the second-to-last show they ever did in the states.\nNirvana, for me though, I grew up on SST [Records]. I\u2019m the same age as Kurt, and vividly remember the day I walked into Rhino Records in Westwood and got Meat Puppets II the day it came out, and Double Nickles by The Minutemen and Hüsker Dü and all those bands.\nFlash forward to 2007, and Courtney [Love] approached me because she\u2019d seen The Kid Stays in the Picture [Morgen\u2019s documentary on Hollywood producer Robert Evans], and she said \u201CWe have all this art of Kurt\u2019s and no one\u2019s really ever seen it, and there\u2019s so much more to him than people knew, and I have these videos.\u201D\nYou know, the type of work I do, Kurt\u2019s art and his audio really lend itself to the way I try to approach non-fiction. Because his art was basically an autobiography of his life. And you start when he\u2019s three, and you see the idealism and the hope in those illustrations, and you can see by seven that the darkness starts to come in. And you start to see a lot of stuff with marionettes, people on strings. Or Fred Flintstone choking Dino. And that sort of throws a wrench into the whole Cobain mythology, because Cobain used to say that he had a happy childhood until he was nine. I don\u2019t believe that to be true. I think he had an ideal childhood until he was about three \u2014 that\u2019s just my personal take on it \u2014 and spent the rest of his life trying to get back to that feeling.\nThere have been a lot of movies and books about Kurt Cobain already. Were there things you felt you hadn\u2019t seen?\nWhen I make these types of films I spend about eight months collecting every piece of media on the subject in existence. And in this case, because of our access to the family materials, we had everything. And I sat down and screened chronologically the first frame of Kurt Cobain to the last frame. It took about three months. And when we got to [1991], when he first started to be photographed in a way that was being disseminated around the world, and we went through that stuff I was shocked. I was like, \u201CThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s how we\u2019ve built him?\u201D \u2026 The Kurt that I\u2019m seeing is so different than the Kurt that presented himself in front of the glare of the lens and the media. I found the stuff around Nevermind was the least interesting stuff for me, and it was all the other stuff where I felt like we got to meet Kurt. The stuff with him and Courtney \u2014 the humor and the wit. They were like Lucy and Ricky. Who would ever have known that? I didn\u2019t know Kurt was fucking Ricky!\n\"I didn't know Kurt was fucking Ricky!\"\nComing here has been really intense because I haven\u2019t been able to tell anyone what we\u2019ve had for all this time. We have Kurt doing The Beatles; nobody\u2019s ever heard that. And the autobiography he does of his childhood, about losing his virginity, most of the stuff nobody knows where it\u2019s from. \u2026 Krist [Novoselic, Nirvana bassist], Courtney, Tracy [Marander, Cobain\u2019s former girlfriend]; no one had ever heard it.\nWhere did that audio come from?\nIn the storage unit I found a box. I had no idea there was going to be any audio. They said, \u201CGo into the storage unit!\u201D and so I went in there with a crew, and we\u2019re documenting everything, photographing everything from every angle and shit. And I open up this box, and there\u2019s 108 cassettes. \u2026 So I\u2019m listening to these tapes, and that audio autobiography comes on. And as I\u2019m listening, first of all I\u2019m like, \u201COh my god. This is so layered. There\u2019s so many things happening here.\u201D \u2026 And then when I went through the journals I found the story. So he wrote it out, and then he recorded it by himself. And I think it was \u201888, if I had to guess when he recorded it, because there was this period where I found he did a lot of spoken word. But all the other spoken word he did, he was doing throwaway. And on that story, he kind of performs it, which is why it sounds so different than any interview you\u2019ve ever heard of Kurt Cobain.\nHim telling any kind of straightforward narrative is a new thing.\nI edited it, to make it a little more linear. But it\u2019s the tone in his voice that I find so chilling. Because it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s slightly aloof or amused as he\u2019s telling this story. But the story is so painful, and there\u2019s that contrast between how he\u2019s delivering it and what he\u2019s saying. I always thought that story was the key to the whole thing. My Rosebud, if you will. After listening to that story, I can\u2019t tell you how many times, I came to a moment where I was dealing with something later in the film, and I stopped and said, wait a second. And I went back to that story, and that line he says. \u201CI couldn\u2019t handle the ridicule, so I went down to the train tracks to kill myself.\u201D I was like, there\u2019s the answer, in his own words.\nAnd it was like being in The Usual Suspects. That moment at the end, where they look up and realize all the clues connect? Suddenly I opened up the journals again and everywhere you looked: threatened by ridicule, shame, humiliation, all this stuff. And as I started to weave the film, that obviously became the throughline of action. And most films will stop at, you know, \u201Che was threatened by ridicule.\u201D But I wanted to know the root cause of it. \u2026 Because that was one of his problems. He could tell you how he felt, but he couldn\u2019t tell you why. He couldn\u2019t give you the square root, and if he could, things might\u2019ve ended up differently. But part of that is being an addict and being disconnected.\nThere\u2019s a lot of footage in the movie that could really upset people when they see it. Was there any struggle, internally with you and the team, about whether you should include that material?\nNot for a second. [pauses] Kurt\u2019s mother, obviously \u2014 what mother wants to see their child depicted like that? That was very difficult for me to show it to her. And that\u2019s the first thing I said to her. I said, \u201CWendy, I\u2019m really sorry. There\u2019s going to be some things in here that you really shouldn\u2019t see, and I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t want you to see.\u201D And Kim [Cobain, Kurt\u2019s sister] said to me after she saw this stuff, she said, \u201CYou know my brother was really ashamed about his heroin use. Do you really think he would want that in the film?\u201D\n\"His biggest fear was that kids were going to start doing Heroin because of him.\"\nI got to know Kim very well during the making of this film, I said Kim, one thing you\u2019ve always told me \u2026 that his biggest fear was that kids were going to start doing heroin because of him. \u2026 So with that understanding, I think seeing Kurt depicted like this\u2026 not only does it de-romanticize heroin, but I think it\u2019s a deterrent. There\u2019s a chance some kid who likes to smoke pot, who likes to do coke, who likes to party is gonna see the film, and is gonna be in a situation where someone says \u201Cyou want to do some smack\u201D and they say no. So what\u2019s a better legacy \u2014 saving one life, or writing a pop song for millions of people? And I think knowing Kurt, he would have chose to save the life.\nAnd I think it was also important because we all know Kurt did heroin, but we never really saw the real impact of that in the MTV interviews and whatnot. So in a way it\u2019s been romanticized, and it\u2019s been mythologized. And by depicting it in a sort of unflinching, honest way it de-glamorizes it, and it sort of brings Kurt to eye level. It wasn\u2019t about bringing him down, but it was about looking him in the eye. And in that moment where they\u2019re doing the haircut, you see the struggle. It\u2019s not just Kurt on heroin. It\u2019s Kurt as a doting father having an internal battle with his own demons. And I think that gives a deep understanding of what he was going through.\nAt the premiere someone asked about the absence of Dave Grohl in the film. You mentioned that you had interviewed him, but didn\u2019t seem in any rush to add that footage into the movie. What are your thoughts there?\nI don\u2019t know if we need two members of Nirvana. It\u2019s a very complicated thing, because the film, the way it\u2019s structured, as you saw it\u2019s not a talking head movie. So each speaker serves an incredibly significant role in Kurt\u2019s life. Krist was there through the entire Nirvana experience, and Dave as you know came in as it was about to explode. It\u2019s one of these things where I didn\u2019t feel the need to have two people talking about the same experience. However, at the same time, I understand the reality that Kurt and Dave are very closely associated with one another. \u2026 I don\u2019t want [audiences] to have that thing, \u201CWhere\u2019s Dave?\u201D Because it takes you out of the film.\nAnd everybody\u2019s aware that there have been past tensions between Dave Grohl and Courtney Love.\nThat was the big thing. At the end of the day, the film you saw was the film I locked. But then I started to think, man, people are going to make more of this than it is. I don\u2019t want this to distract. And Dave had some great things to say. It\u2019s just when you spend eight years making a movie, and then three weeks after you lock picture you do an interview, and it\u2019s like Christmas, and you\u2019re on a mixing stage for 16 hours a day\u2026. I spent too much time on this film to fucking rush something like that. And so literally it was less than 10 days ago I said to the distributors, \u201CIt\u2019s not going to happen for Sundance. I need more time with it.\u201D So we\u2019ll see what happens. I\u2019m gonna go back and do a little work on it after Berlin.\n","Title":"Finding the real Kurt Cobain: a conversation with documentary director Brett Morgen | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment","film"]}
