Bulky and stiff, the suit made it pretty hard for the astronauts aboard Apollo 11 to walk around. So, the fact that Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s most iconic moments also happen to make them look like they\u2019re float-bouncing across the Moon\u2019s surface is actually the product of their equipment \u2014 not the Moon\u2019s low gravity.\nwe\u2019ve spent the last 40 years without testing just how fast astronauts can get around in lunar gravity\nYet, despite knowing how restrictive the space suit was during the moon landing, we\u2019ve spent the last 40 years without ever testing just how fast astronauts can get around on the Moon. Thankfully, a group of NASA scientists have finally looked into the question. And, according to  the study they published today in the Journal of Experimental Biology, humans can run a lot faster in lunar gravity than anyone ever expected.\nIn the study, researchers took eight study participants \u2014 three of which were actual astronauts \u2014 on a trip aboard NASA\u2019s DC-9 aircraft, a plane capable of reducing its internal gravity to that of the moon during swooping, parabolic flights. There, the astronauts were asked to run on a treadmill during 20 second-long dips at lunar gravity.\nCredit: NASA\nJohn De Witt, senior biomechanist at the NASA Johnson Space Center and a study co-author,  told a reporter at the Journal of Experimental Biology that the experiment wasn't exactly pleasant for the eight participants. \"If you get sick you're done... We wanted to be sure we had people that were used to flying.\" Still, it appears that they made it through with flying colors.\nAccording to NASA's theoretical calculations, the test subjects should have had an average walk-to-run transition speed of about 1.8 miles per hour (that's compared with transition speeds of 4.5 miles per hour here on Earth). But in the real-life setting offered by the DC-9 aircraft, things turned out differently: the participants' average transition speed was actually 3.13 miles per hour \u2014 a speed that's much closer to those we see on Earth.\nCredit: NASA\nSo why were NASA\u2019s theoretical calculations off-base? De Witt thinks the forces generated by the counter-swinging movement of the runners' arms and legs gave them a boost. That force probably exist on Earth as well, he said, but because Earth\u2019s gravity is far stronger, the effect is too small to notice.\nCredit: NASA\n","Title":"NASA astronauts tested how fast humans can run on the moon | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
