Even better than that, though, is finding out that the people involved in making your favorite on-screen stories come to life often have passion projects of their own.\nTake the above for example, writer and director Tony Elliott's short film Entangled. In it, Elliott \u2014 a screenwriter for the well-regarded sci-fi drama Orphan Black \u2014 tells a story of a woman whose lover is suffering debilitating side effects of a quantum device he's created. Her attempt to save him and the repercussions they both endure is a tense, futuristic take on a story that's been told endless times before. Reminiscent of indie sci-fi films like Shane Carruth's Primer and Upstream Color, it's moody and pensive without getting too bogged down in supplying you with specifics, letting the focus stay on the show-stopping performance from lead actress Christine Horne. It was recently part of the the Toronto International Film Festival and is well worth a watch, plus it'll help pass the time until Orphan Black season 3 debuts in 2015.\n","Title":"Orphan Black writer's passion project is about love and quantum mechanics | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","watch-this","entertainment"]}
