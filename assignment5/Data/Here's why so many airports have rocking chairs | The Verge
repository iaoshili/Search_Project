{"Main text":"Here's why so many airports have rocking chairs\nIt all started with a photography show about porches\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI first noticed the rocking chairs a few years ago while flying out of Seattle. It seemed like a quirky touch not out of character at an airport with an abundance of art and whose drinking fountains play amplified gargling sounds. Then I noticed them in Durham. Then in San Diego.\nIf I had to pick places I\u2019d expect to see rocking chairs, front porches, living rooms, and pretty much anywhere else would rank far above cavernous and stark airport terminals, yet that\u2019s probably where I\u2019m most likely to see them. And while I could imagine an aggressively whimsical designer somewhere throwing a bunch of rocking chairs in a terminal, I had a hard time seeing how they\u2019d sprung up in so many airports across the country. Why rocking chairs? Where did they come from?\n(Columbia Metropolitan Airport, S.C., Robert Couse-Baker \/ Flickr )\nIt turns out they come from a guy named Champ Land and his wife, Jean, who co-own Troutman Chairs in North Carolina, where the trend began.\n\"We\u2019ve got rockers in about 40 airports around the country,\" Land says, perplexed by my call at first but clearly proud of his dominance in the airport rocking chair industry. \"Philly has rockers, Burlington has rockers \u2014 right many of the North and South Carolina airports have rockers.\"\nThe chairs are called Kennedy Rockers, named after the type that John F. Kennedy used to alleviate his back pain . Kennedy had dozens of the chairs and placed them everywhere  \u2014 in the Oval Office, at Camp David, and aboard Air Force One. Kennedy\u2019s chairs were made by P&P, another North Carolina company, which the Lands bought in 2009. The chairs are tall and straight, with flat wooden slats running up the back and a curved seat. In airports, they\u2019re usually painted white or stained and left unpainted.\n(Reagan National, Matt Billings \/ Flickr )\nThe trend started by accident in 1997 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport. The airport had a temporary photography exhibit called Porch Sitting, says Haley Gentry, who manages amenities at Charlotte Douglas. There were large photos of front porches, with rocking chairs, and in front of the photos, as props, actual rocking chairs. When the exhibit\u2019s time was up they took the chairs away, and people got upset.\n\"We didn\u2019t realize how popular they were 'til we went to remove the exhibit,\" Gentry says. \"We went to remove the rocking chairs and we got such a public outcry that we said, \u2018Wow, we need to keep these here,\u2019 and we expanded them.\"\nFrom there, the rockers spread from airport to airport. The people I spoke to at Sea-Tac and Miami were a little hazy on exactly where the idea for the chairs came from \u2014 someone who worked for the airport saw them at another airport, thought they were nice, and contacted Land, who became the de facto supplier of airport rocking chairs.\n(Boston Logan, Matthew Walker \/ Flickr )\nThe chairs caught on for the same reason they seem so out of place: airports are not, typically, pleasant and relaxing places. Security is an ordeal. The threat of missed flights or delays gives everything an undercurrent of anxiety. And through it all, you\u2019re lugging unwieldy baggage. Rocking chairs signal the opposite of hurry.\nThey\u2019re also an easy addition to terminals, which are ordinarily difficult to renovate. Airports are always in use; they can\u2019t be simply shut down and redesigned, so any improvements have to be made piecemeal. Rocking chairs are basically modular seating that can be installed overnight and rearranged as needed. A bonus, Gentry points out, is that they can be moved near power outlets, often in short supply at older terminals.\n(Anne Santos \/ Flickr )\n\"Airports tend to be such a fast-paced environment,\" Gentry says. \"It can be overwhelming for people who aren\u2019t seasoned travelers. The rocker is a yin to that yang. It\u2019s more of a slow pace. You\u2019re controlling the rocker, where a lot of the time in an airport you\u2019re not controlling your environment. It\u2019s a nice pause button in a hectic environment.\"\nLand gives a similar reason for his chair\u2019s success. \"A rocker is something that relaxes you, and everyone is uptight in an airport,\" he says. \"If you get enough rockers in there, that\u2019s at least that many people who aren\u2019t going to be calling and raising heck about something.\"\n","Title":"Here's why so many airports have rocking chairs | The Verge","Tags":["report","design","transportation"]}
