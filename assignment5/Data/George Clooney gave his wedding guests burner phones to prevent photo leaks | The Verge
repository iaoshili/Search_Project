{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's a tricky security problem: how do you let your wedding guests take photos, but make sure none of the photos leak? If you're George Clooney , you collect everyone's phone and give each of them a burner phone just for the occasion, to be tossed away once the big day is over. It's an expensive way around the problem, sure, but if you're a movie star, it's a small price to pay.\nThe bigger question, tossed around in security circles, is how all this actually worked. Supposedly, Clooney's people had access to all of the photos taken with the burner phones, so they would know who took which photos and would be able to trace back any leaks that came out. Vogue had bought exclusive photography rights to the wedding (donating the fee to charity), so Clooney had reason to be protective of the photos. But as some in the security world have noted, it may not have been an airtight system.\nOtherwise, seems simple to elude: Text\/email photo to yourself, scrub metadata, delete text and photo from phone, and sell that puppy.\n\u2014 Kashmir Hill (@kashhill) September 29, 2014\nOf course, from a security perspective, the race is hard to win anyway. If someone was really dead-set on leaking that million-dollar wedding photo to TMZ, they could have just smuggled in a camera of their own. If the burner phones worked \u2014 and Clooney's photo embargo has held, so far \u2014 it may be more due to well-behaved guests than airtight infosec.\n","Title":"George Clooney gave his wedding guests burner phones to prevent photo leaks | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
