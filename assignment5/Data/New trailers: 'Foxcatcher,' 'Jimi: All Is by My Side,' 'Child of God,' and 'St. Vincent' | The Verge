{"Main text":"20 Comments\nYou might have some free time to see a couple movies this long weekend (or you might just be busy grilling). Either way, there's a lot playing right now \u2014 including Transformers: Age of Extinction , Snowpiercer , and Deliver Us From Evil \u2014 and there's a lot to look ahead to as well. If you're interested in seeing what's coming up, we've got six new trailers from the past week below that are all worth watching.\nFoxcatcher\nFoxcatcher received some rave reviews out of Cannes the other month, and its initial teasers make it look just as good. The film tells the story of Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz, in what looks to be a dark and thrilling drama. It\u2019ll hit theaters November 14th \u2014 and yes, that is Steve Carell.\nJimi: All Is by My Side\nJimi: All Is by My Side is a close look at a single year in the life of Jimi Hendrix during the late \u201960s, as he was right on the verge of going big. With John Ridley, the writer behind 12 Years a Slave, both writing and directing here and Outkast\u2019s André Benjamin starring as Hendrix, this one\u2019ll be worth paying attention to. It\u2019s in theaters September 26th.\nChild of God\nDespite primarily being a novelist, Cormac McCarthy\u2019s name may be more prominent than ever up on the screen as his books continue to be adapted into gritty and thrilling pictures. The latest, Child of God, comes from James Franco, who both writes and directs. It\u2019ll be in theaters August 1st.\nSt. Vincent\nThe irresponsible-adult-takes-care-of-an-impressionable-kid thing has been done time and again, but there have been far worse adults as their stars than Bill Murray, who basically guarantees that there\u2019ll be some laughs throughout St. Vincent\u2019s debauchery. The film opens on October 24th.\nThe Killing\nThe Killing has been cancelled twice now, but fortunately for fans, Netflix is bringing it back for a short and conclusive fourth season. The episodes will all go online at the beginning of next month, and you can take a first look above.\nTo Be Takei\nGeorge Takei has become something of a social media phenomenon, arguably bringing the actor more attention than ever. Next month, on August 22nd, he\u2019ll be the subject of the documentary To Be Takei, chronicling his life from childhood to Star Trek to Facebook star.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Foxcatcher,' 'Jimi: All Is by My Side,' 'Child of God,' and 'St. Vincent' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
