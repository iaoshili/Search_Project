{"Main text":"David Petraeus sentenced to probation for leaking government secrets\nThe sentencing ends a drawn out, embarrassing ordeal for the former CIA Director\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFormer CIA Director and retired General David Petraeus was sentenced to two years of probation and a $100,000 fine today for leaking classified government intelligence to his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell. The sentence is the end of a drawn out, very public ordeal for Petraeus, whose fall from grace was precipitous.\nPetraeus will avoid prison\nThe scandal  started in 2012 , when the FBI discovered \u2014 apparently by accident \u2014 that Petraeus, then CIA Director, was disclosing classified information to Broadwell. Petraeus soon resigned from the agency, and charges were filed against him by the Justice Department. Petraeus ultimately  took a deal , pleading guilty to one charge of sharing classified information.\nAlthough that charge carries the potential for one year in prison, prosecutors agreed to recommend against prison time for Petraeus \u2014 reportedly  a controversial decision within the Justice Department \u2014 and a judge concurred, although the judge also increased the fine to $60,000 more than what prosecutors asked for. Petraeus avoided additional charges for lying to the FBI during its investigation.\nA trial would likely have turned into another protracted spectacle for Petraeus and law enforcement, as more emails from Petraeus' personal life, as well as government secrets, would be revealed.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
