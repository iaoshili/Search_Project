Today one of its biggest shows ever, Friends, has arrived on Netflix. The agreement to bring Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross to the streaming service was  announced back in October , but New Year's Day \u2014 right now \u2014 is the first time subscribers can start binging on the 10 seasons of what ranks as one of the most popular sitcoms in TV history.\nCheers to twenty FRIENDS teen. All 10 seasons of #Friends are #NowOnNetflix https:\/\/t.co\/tvf21OcYSQ\n\u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) January 1, 2015\nThe entire series is in HD, widescreen, and features 5.1 audio;  Friends was converted to Blu-Ray in 2012, which was the original reason for going back to the vault and remastering the old 35mm film. But now Netflix customers also get to see the show in its upgraded form (without dealing with 21 discs), and it has never looked better.\nSome other shows from NBC's glory days like Frasier have long been on Netflix, but you'll have to head over to Sony's Crackle for select episodes of Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld has  previously confirmed talks about bringing his show about nothing to Netflix. Friends is easily the company's biggest pickup in some time, but we've learned by now that Reed Hastings and Co. rarely sit still in pursuing other deals.\nNote: Many people are finding it difficult to stream Friends when searching with the company's mobile and TV apps. We'd recommend adding it to your watch list by  following this link . Once that's done, the series will be easily accessible on your smartphone, Roku, game console, or any other device you use to watch Netflix. It seems Friends is still so new to Netflix that it's not coming up in obvious search queries; we'd expect the company to have this fixed before long.\n","Title":"Every episode of Friends is now on Netflix | The Verge","Tags":["apps","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
