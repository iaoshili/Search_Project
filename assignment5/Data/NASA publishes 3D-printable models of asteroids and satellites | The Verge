{"Main text":"NASA publishes 3D-printable models of asteroids and satellites\nYou can now print a miniature replica of the Gale Crater\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDo you have a favorite NASA satellite? There's a small chance that you can now make a tiny figurine out if it using a 3D printer, as NASA has transformed a number of spacecrafts, asteroids, and features of Mars and the Moon  into 3D-printable models . NASA has actually provided  free 3D models for years now , but it appears that just recently it updated its modeling site with 22 files designed for 3D printing. The printable models have all been scaled down to a size that can actually fit inside a printer, so each one should measure no more than 4-inches long at its widest point.\nThe available models include the spacecrafts Cassini, Kepler, and Voyager, parts of Mars including the Gale Crater and Valles Marineris canyons, and parts of the Moon including scans of its near and far side. Even if you don't own a 3D printer, the models come from NASA, so you should be able to send a favorite off to a printing service to have it made. That said, NASA doesn't make it sound as though these models are necessarily perfect for printing just yet, and it's looking for comments on whether any of its currently published models need to have adjustments made to them for a successful print.\n","Title":"NASA publishes 3D-printable models of asteroids and satellites | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
