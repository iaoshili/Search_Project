{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt may be January, but Motorola is still hoping it can find more people interested in buying the Moto X at a discount. We've already seen  a few nice sales come and go , but the worst laggards among you will have yet another chance to buy it next month at Moto's second-gen flagship on February 2nd. For a limited time, the company will offer a one-time use promotional code that takes $140 off any purchase of $499.99 and above \u2014 before tax is factored in. That's more or less the same deal we saw on Cyber Monday.\nYou'll need to toss in an accessory or two (or a Moto 360) if you only want the $449 32GB Moto X. Choosing the recently launched 64GB Pure Edition for $599.99 is plenty to meet the price requirement. Sadly, the $140 promo can't be used towards the Nexus 6 \u2014 even if Motorola miraculously has the Google phone in stock.\nThe code must be used by February 14th (Valentine's Day) at 11:59PM ET. If you're not looking to spend that much, or if the Moto G will do the job just fine, Motorola will also take $50 off a pre-tax purchase of at least $249.99. If you forget to request the code on February 2nd, Moto will have another, slightly less appealing sale just a day later. There, you'll be able to take off $100 from pre-tax purchases of $499.99 or $35 off a final receipt of at least $249.99. Yeah, we're at the mid-cycle point, but the Moto X is still one of the better Android experiences you can get.\n","Title":"Motorola offering more big discounts on Moto X starting February 2nd | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
