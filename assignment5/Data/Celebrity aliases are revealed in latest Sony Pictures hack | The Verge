{"Main text":"Celebrity aliases are revealed in latest Sony Pictures hack\nAnd they are Nazzo Good\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe  monumental hack of seemingly every document ever produced at Sony Pictures has yielded a fresh trove of mildly amusing information: the aliases used by celebrities when they are trying to avoid being detected. Fusion  has a full list of the names, along with some explanations of how they came to be. It's mostly a snooze, but points to Rob Schneider, whose alias of \"Nazzo Good\" doubles when spoken aloud as a review of his  movies ; and to Jessica Alba, who apparently checks into hotels under the name \"Cash Money.\" Ice Cube has the most badass aliases of anyone on the list \u2014 he uses both Darius Stone and O'Shea Jackson. (Stone is a badass name because it was his character's name in the seminal XXX: State of the Union, and Jackson is because it's his actual name.)\nPossibly of more concern to Sony Pictures actors: their contact information is also part of the latest document dump.  Fusion reports that Tom Hanks, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts are among those affected. It's easy to change an alias; changing a cell phone number is going to be a bit more work.
