Abrams clarified during today's event.\n\"The force is strong in my family\"\n\"The force is strong in my family,\" we hear him say as we see the charred remains of Darth Vader. \"My father has it. I have it. My sister has it.\" We see Skywalker's mechanical hand reach out and touch R2-D2, and then we see someone \u2014 Luke? Leia? \u2014 hand off a lightsaber to someone else \u2014 Leia? Skywalker spawn?\n\"You have that power, too,\" he says. At this point, we're a minute into the trailer, and this is where stuff hits the fan. We see more of Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) flying with his squadron of X-Wings, a quick slash of the new lightsaber, Rey and Finn (Daisy Ridley and John Boyega) running from an explosion, and images of Kylo Ren (widely thought to be Adam Driver from Girls) and the new Stormtrooper army.\nThere's so much more, too, like exploding TIE fighters and some more footage of the Millennium Falcon from the scene we first saw in the original teaser . And who is this metallic Stormtrooper?\nBut the cherry on top of this nerdy cake is, of course, our first real sighting of some of the original cast members. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) standing on the deck of the Falcon is a sight for sore eyes, and like with the original teaser, everything here just looks right.\nIt's a much deeper look at The Force Awakens than we got back in November. That original 88-second glimpse gave us insight to the new characters played by Boyega, Isaac, and Ridley, as well as Ren's shadowy figure (who was sporting an unusual lightsaber ). If you piece these two together, a better picture of Episode VII starts to take shape. But eight months is still a long damn time to wait for the real thing.\n","Title":"Watch the new trailer for Star Wars Episode VII | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
