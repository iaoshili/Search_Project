{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvery week, a veritable flood of new music is released to the world, and with it the tyranny of choice rears its ugly head. There's only so many hours in the day, so where do you focus your listening energies? That's where our Verge New Music Recommendations come in: it's our entirely subjective, non-comprehensive attempt to throw the favorite new songs and albums we've stumbled upon this week your way. Of course, we're barely skimming the surface here \u2014 feel free to throw any auditory discoveries you've made this week in the comments, and get busy listening.\nChumped \u2014 Teenage Retirement\nThe same advice we gave regarding Michael Bay's new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles flick applies to Chumped\u2019s debut LP:  Don\u2019t think, just enjoy . That\u2019s not meant to be a slight, it\u2019s just that if you\u2019re looking for dense lyrics that make you ponder the answers to life\u2019s toughest questions, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Teenage Retirement is many things \u2014 loud, fast, surprisingly melodic, unabashedly fun \u2014 but one thing it is not is challenging. Anika Pyle and the boys behind her churned out 11 songs that will get your heart racing faster than a Red Bull can (plus one slow one for good measure), and the end result is a debut that hopefully lays the groundwork for a long run to come for Chumped. Once you\u2019ve gotten to the point where you\u2019re listening to it incessantly, go back and dig up their even catchier EPs, and then for pop-punk\u2019s sake go see them live.  \u2014 Sean O'Kane\nColleen Green \u2014 \"Pay Attention\"\nColleen Green put out an album last year of wonderfully fuzzy songs filled with lo-fi guitars and steady drums, and this year it looks like she's polishing it all for a sound that's cleaner and poppier, without losing any of that laid-back attitude. \"Pay Attention\" is the first single off her new album, coming in February, and we're digging it so far.  \u2014 Jake Kastrenakes\nHudson Mohawke \u2014 \"Chimes (Remix)\"\nHudson Mohawke makes awesome beats. \"Chimes\" is one of them, and this remix puts it in the hands of some capable rappers \u2014 including Future and Pusha T \u2014 to make it all the better.  \u2014 J.K.\nJack Garratt \u2014 \"The Love You're Given\"\n\"The Love You're Given\" sounds like what would happen if James Blake tried making a beat out of a classical singer's old record \u2014 which is awesome. It starts slow and moody and then blooms into something much bigger, so keep listening.  \u2014 J.K.\nMargot & the Nuclear So and So's \u2014 Tell Me More About Evil\nMargot & the Nuclear So and So\u2019s added even more heart-melting songs to their deep and diverse catalog this week with Tell Me More About Evil. It\u2019s not necessarily a \"new album,\" rather a new spin on the band\u2019s last full-length (Sling Shot to Heaven) from earlier this year. These new versions of the songs were recorded for the 16mm short film they released over the summer, which was a visually captivating but ultimately aimless project. But the mastered versions of the track that appear on Evil are warm and intimate, even despite the downtrodden tone that many of them carry in the lyrics and songwriting. Most are also set to the gentle whir of the 16mm camera, which sounds completely obnoxious but actually adds to the ambiance of the stripped-down songs. The beauty of Evil is that each song was done in one take, which produced impossibly delicate performances from singer Richard Edwards and the rest of the members of the band who appear throughout the album.  \u2014 S.O.\nMourn \u2014 \"Otitis\"\nMourn is a group of four teenagers who make some pretty great indie rock. I'm not sure if it's just because I know that they're all 18 and under, but hearing them definitely takes you back to that weird bar you once saw your friend's high-school band in. It's moody, it's energetic, and you should definitely take a listen. Pitchfork named \"Otitis\" a Best New Track this week.  \u2014 J.K.\nNite Fields \u2014 \"You I Never Knew\"\n\"You I Never Knew\" is dark and dreamy and just totally sucks you into its gentle fight against some abstract and gloomy haze. Listen to it, and you might just feel like it's the early 2000s and you're hearing some strangely shimmering Interpol track. \u2014 J.K.\nPusha T \u2014 \"Lunch Money\"\nPusha T has a long history of collaborating with Kanye West, and this latest track, which West produced, is just totally insane. It's like Pusha T is rapping over future-funk, some crazy, warbled, stuttering beat that he makes sound far too easy to keep a hold on. You can definitely hear West's touch. Also: this might be the first rap track to reference the Apple Watch. It's not off to a good start. \u2014 J.K.\nTV on the Radio \u2014 Seeds\nTV on the Radio's new album isn't quite a return to Return to Cookie Mountain, but that doesn't mean it's not a strong effort in its own right. All the hallmarks of the band's uniquely layered sound are there, and it's just as hard to nail down as always. \"Quartz\" and \"Seeds,\" which bookend the album, are two of the highlights and get things started and finished on seriously high notes \u2014 but everything else in between is worth a listen, too. It's a particularly poignant listen given the passing of TV on the Radio's bassist Gerard Smith from cancer back in 2011. \u2014 Nathan Ingraham\n","Title":"New music recommendations: Pusha T, Colleen Green, TV on the Radio, and more | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
