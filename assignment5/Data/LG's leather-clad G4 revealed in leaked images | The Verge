{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLG has been teasing its upcoming G4 flagship in drips and drabs, but now the floodgates are open. A work-in-progress microsite for the G4 was discovered this weekend courtesy of prolific leaker Evan Blass , and contained within are dozens of official renders of the new smartphone.\nThanks to the leak, we get to see the G4 from all angles, but you'll be forgiven for thinking it looks a whole lot like the LG G3 before it. Other than some cosmetic tweaks \u2014 like an optional real leather back and a pseudo carbon-fiber weave on the front \u2014 the core of the device certainly does seem very familiar.\nThe images reveal what appear to be a multitude of swappable back plates. There are at least six different real leather backs (ranging from black and brown to baby blue and yellow), as well as three more traditional plastic backs. It's fair to assume that the leather versions will carry a cost premium. The LG Quick Circle case, which has a window to let you view notifications while the cover is closed, also appears to be making a return with the G4.\nAnother massive leak for LG\nAs for specs, the details listed on the site (which has been pulled offline) appear to be mostly placeholders. The camera seems to be the standout here. The previously-revealed 16-megapixel , f\/1.8 camera will have laser autofocus and an infrared color spectrum analyzer for more accurate color reproduction, according to the site. There will also be a full-manual shooting mode. The other specs on the G4 include a 5.5-inch, quad HD screen, a replaceable 3,000mAh battery, and a microSD card slot. That leaves little to the imagination, but we expect to learn the scant remaining details at LG's press conference on April 28th .\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"LG's leather-clad G4 revealed in leaked images | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
