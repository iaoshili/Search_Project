{"Main text":"Office for Android tablets enters preview alongside new iPhone version\nTouch-optimized versions coming to Windows 10 next year\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is making some big improvements to its Office mobile apps today, starting with an entirely new iPhone app. When the original iPhone version debuted last year, it was basic and underwhelming. Today\u2019s new iPhone app is a lot more similar to the iPad version, and that\u2019s a good thing. After using the new app over the past several days I can\u2019t imagine going back to the old Office Mobile solution. The entire codebase has been replaced with the iPad version, creating a universal app that brings all the features you\u2019d expect.\nThe confusing interface is gone, replaced with easier editing options and the ability to shape and move photos and other elements in documents. There\u2019s a special formula keyboard in Excel, a full screen view, and little optimizations for bigger iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus displays. On the PowerPoint side there\u2019s also transition and animation support, the ability to play audio and video from slides, and the usual presentation view. Native Dropbox support is also available in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for iPhone. Most importantly, it\u2019s  free to view and edit documents now, a big change Microsoft is unveiling across all of its mobile apps today .\nOffice for Android tablets is just like the iPad version\nMicrosoft is also  accepting signups for an Android tablet version of Office today. It\u2019s pretty much identical to the iPad version in terms of features, and it even looks similar. Office for Android will only support KitKat and above, and Microsoft plans to start distributing it to preview participants in December. \"Our goal with this preview is to ensure that we get a broad representation of the vast array of form factors, device types, and operating system versions that the Android tablet install base represents, and make sure we can polish these apps,\" explains Microsoft\u2019s head of Office marketing Michael Atalla.\n","Title":"Office for Android tablets enters preview alongside new iPhone version | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","google","tech"]}
