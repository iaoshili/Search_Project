{"Main text":"'Rush Hour' may be made into a TV show\nFrom the creator of 'Scrubs'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's probably impossible to replace the hilarious duo of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, but someone's going to try:  Deadline reports that Rush Hour is now in the process of being adapted into a TV series. The show will be an action-comedy with hourlong episodes, and it'll likely still be about a Hong Kong police officer getting stuck with a wild LA cop. The show happening isn't a done deal just yet \u2014 it still needs to find a network \u2014 but Deadline suggests that it could be a hot property, so we just end up getting to see the remake.\nScrubs creator Bill Lawrence will reportedly be co-writing and executive producing the new series. Arthur Sarkissian, who produced the three Rush Hour films, and Brett Ratner, who just directed Hercules, will also be executive producers. That certainly sounds like an odd pairing with Lawrence, but it may just make enough sense: Sarkissian and Ratner know action, and Lawrence is a master of the type of goofy comedy that could work perfectly in a Rush Hour series. Call me overly nostalgic for Scrubs, but maybe this remake isn't as bad of an idea as it sounds on the surface.\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
