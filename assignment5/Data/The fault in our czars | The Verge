{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt a meeting Thursday night, President Obama suggested that in order to effectively tackle the Ebola issue in the United States, he would \"appoint an additional person\u2026 just to make sure that we are crossing all the t\u2019s and dotting all the i\u2019s going forward.\" By Friday morning, the media had dubbed Ron Klain, Obama's chosen appointee, the Ebola Czar.\nAt first blush an Ebola Czar, or any czar really, invokes an image of a cruel and omnipotent character parading around in heavy velvet robes, and carrying a jeweled scepter. Not an obvious choice for someone to manage a national healthcare crisis. But take a look under that robe and you\u2019ll find that \"\u2018czar\" \u2014 at least in the context of American politics \u2014 is a relatively meaningless term, largely crafted by the media as convenient shorthand for long, cumbersome titles. It\u2019s a blustery euphemism meant to inspire confidence when in fact, these czars are little more than run-of-the-mill government appointees, often faced with the same challenges as less imperious workers. Just like other employees, czars are eventually replaced, retire, or their positions are scrapped.\nToday\u2019s Ebola czar joins a long and storied rank of czars who have reigned over political kingdoms large, small, and on occasion, bizarre. So we thought we\u2019d pull together a sample platter of our favorite presidentially-appointed government czars. It will, I\u2019m certain, leave you czar struck.\nManpower Czar - Appointed in 1942 by Franklin Roosevelt\nRubber Czar - Appointed in 1942 by Franklin Roosevelt\nShipping Czar - Appointed in 1942 by Franklin Roosevelt\nCleanup Czar - Appointed in 1952 by Harry Truman\nMissile Czar - Appointed in 1957 by Dwight D.
