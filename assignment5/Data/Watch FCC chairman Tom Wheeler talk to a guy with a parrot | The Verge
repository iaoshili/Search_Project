{"Main text":"Watch FCC chairman Tom Wheeler talk to a guy with a parrot\nHis mission is to spread love and peace\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTom Wheeler is a busy man: not only is he running one of the most critical agencies in Washington, he's been dealing with theÂ  hot-button topic of net neutrality practically since the first day he set foot in the FCC's office a year and a half ago.\nDon't let anyone tell you he doesn't have time for a parrot, though.\nShortly after his address at the broadcast-focused NAB show in Las Vegas this week, Wheeler was spotted on an escalator having a conversation with a gentleman with an emerald green parrot on his shoulder \u2014 because it's Vegas, and it's a trade show, and, you know, why the heck not. The audio's a little difficult to hear, but it seems to go something like this:\nMan with parrot: This is [inaudible] Yaffa.\nWheeler: Hello, Yaffa!\nMan with parrot: Our mission is to spread love and peace.\nWheeler: How could you be against that?\nAnd with that, the all-too-brief escalator ride came to its end; the encounter was over. For Wheeler, back to the Title II grind; for Yaffa, back to the mission of spreading love and peace.
