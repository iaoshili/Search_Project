{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is planning to distribute future Windows 10 updates using a peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol. While Microsoft has traditionally uses Windows Update to deliver OS and some application updates from a single source, the  latest leaked build of Windows 10 reveals that the company is moving towards P2P. A new option allows Windows 10 users to enable \"updates from more than one place,\" with the ability to download apps and OS updates from multiple sources to obtain them more quickly.\nCrowdsourcing updates\nApps and OS updates can be downloaded from Microsoft and PCs on a local network, or a combination of local PCs, internet PCs, and Microsoft\u2019s traditional Windows Update servers. It\u2019s no surprise that Microsoft is moving towards this distribution model. The software maker  acquired Pando Networks in 2013, the maker of a peer-to-peer file sharing technology that\u2019s similar to BitTorrent. It\u2019s not clear what technology Microsoft is using for its Windows 10 testing, but it\u2019s reasonable to expect it has evolved from the Pando Networks acquisition.\nMicrosoft has not yet officially announced its P2P plans, but the company is planning to release an official Windows 10 preview shortly that will likely include the new changes. While Microsoft\u2019s changes could prompt security concerns over the validity of OS updates, it\u2019s likely that the company has built in methods to prevent tampering and a means to verify update packages before they\u2019re applied to Windows 10 systems.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Windows 10\n","Title":"Microsoft to deliver Windows 10 updates using peer-to-peer technology | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
