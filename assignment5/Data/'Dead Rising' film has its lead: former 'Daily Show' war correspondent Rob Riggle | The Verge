When a mandatory government vaccine fails to stop the infection from spreading, the four leads must evade infection while also pursuing the root of the epidemic, with all signs pointing to a government conspiracy. Politics, public paranoia, and media coverage play an important role in the story's narrative.\nRiggle will play photojournalist and oddball-weapon-creation-enthusiast Frank West, who was the main character in Capcom's original Dead Rising film. The movie \u2014 which will not play in theaters and instead debut on Sony's Crackle service \u2014 is written by Tim Carter ( Mortal Kombat: Legacy ).\nIn addition to performer, Riggle was a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He's served in Liberia, Kosovoa, and Afghanistan. He also went to Iraq in 2007 to file field segments for The Daily Show as well as entertain troops for USO. So for those who know Dead Rising already, let's just make the joke together:  he's covered wars, you know .\nAnd now, the best of Riggle's Daily Show tenure as presented by  then-correspondent-now-HBO-satirist John Oliver .\n","Title":"'Dead Rising' film has its lead: former 'Daily Show' war correspondent Rob Riggle | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
