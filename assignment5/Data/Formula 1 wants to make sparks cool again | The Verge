Autosports writes that F1 teams considered using glowing brake discs and vapor trails to make the world-famous races more dramatic, but eventually settled on '80s-esque sparking cars. According to Autosport, provisional approval has since been given by the F1 Commission to implement these plans in 2015, which will involve installing titanium skid blocks on all cars. Steps are currently being taken to determine where best to position these attachments \u2014 normally used for safety purposes \u2014 in order to produce the most grandiose effects.\nBoth Ferrari and Mercedes are outfitting their race cars with skid blocks for the upcoming Austrian Grand Prix practice on Friday, marking the beginning of an upcoming series of tests.
