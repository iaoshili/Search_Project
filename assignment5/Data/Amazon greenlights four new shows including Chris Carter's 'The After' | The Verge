{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon has decided to pick up four of the pilots it  recently previewed for customers as part of the company's next phase of original programming.  Chris Carter's The After is among the selections \u2014 though few were betting against the famed X-Files creator getting the green light. Bosch, an adaptation of Michael Connelly\u2019s best-selling novels, is pick number two. Jill Soloway's Transparent will be getting the full series treatment, as will Mozart in the Jungle. The latter was among our favorites of the bunch thanks to its strong pilot written by Jason Schwartzman, Roman Coppola, and Alex Timbers.\nIn fact, only one of the pilots hasn't received Amazon's stamp of approval, and that's The Rebels. The show follows a trophy wife's attempts to run a football team. We came away unimpressed with the first episode, and apparently Amazon's Prime subscribers felt the same way. But there may be hope for creators Ice Cube and Michael Strahan:  according to Variety , plans to move forward with The Rebels have been reportedly put on hold rather than cancelled outright.\nThere's plenty at stake as Amazon prepares its latest crop of original programming. Netflix remains the dominant player among streaming services thanks to proven hits like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Amazon's first original shows Alpha House and Betas largely failed to make an impact. The former will return for a second run, but Amazon has announced that it's done with Betas. The company is undoubtedly hoping that it will pick up more momentum with this second try \u2014 thanks in no small part to Chris Carter.\n","Title":"Amazon greenlights four new shows including Chris Carter's 'The After' | The Verge","Tags":["web","entertainment","tech"]}
