{"Main text":"Try bending your mind around this Google Cube music video\nAn interactive music video created in partnership with electro duo The Presets\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere are different sides to everything, including indie band The Presets' new single, \"No Fun.\" The music video for the song is housed in Google Creative Labs' Cube, a widget capable of running multiple videos and audio tracks concurrently. Each panel is occupied by a different clip  \u2014 talking heads, a woman in a bathtub, a dancer on an urban adventure \u2014 and a separate layer of the music.\nThe Cube's audio is synchronized with its movements, meaning it can be rotated to hear how different segments harmonize with one another. Traditionalists can also opt to listen to the track in its entirety by \"flattening\" the digital hexahedron with a click of a button.  Google Product Marketing Manager Ernesto Sorian explains that the Cube is an \"experimental platform for interactive storytelling\" intended for the production of art divorced from \"two-dimensional traditional constraints.\" Like its Google Maps-toting predecessor , the Cube uses HTML5 and WebGL technology, and is best viewed on Chrome browsers or Android devices.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
