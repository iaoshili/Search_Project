{"Main text":"Uber adds SOS button in India following alleged rape\nTaxi-hailing service introduces new features in attempt to bolster rider security\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber today  introduced two new features aimed at enhancing safety for passengers in India, where the car service has come under increased scrutiny after a driver allegedly  raped a female passenger late last year. The new features, available as part of an in-app update, allow users to share details of their rides with up to five contacts, and to call the police using a new SOS button in case of an emergency.\nThe new \"Send Status\" feature is an enhanced version of the ShareMyETA option that has been available for over a year. After ordering a car, users can choose to share details of their ride \u2014 including the driver's photo, license plate number, and live GPS tracking \u2014 with up to five pre-selected contacts. Those contacts can then track the ride in real-time from start to finish, and the customer won't face any SMS charges.\nThe SOS button, located in the top right of the screen, is designed to let users quickly contact local authorities in the case of an emergency. After tapping it, the rider will be prompted to confirm the call before placing it. Uber  hinted at these changes late last year, after the company vowed to deploy a \"local team of specially-trained safety experts\" to strengthen background checks of its driver. It was  later reported that the driver accused of raping the female passenger near Delhi also faced rape charges in 2011.\nLast year's incident in Delhi sparked widespread controversy in India, where services like Uber are generally seen as a safer alternative for female passengers. According to  recent government statistics , 585 women were raped in Delhi in 2012, more than any other Indian city. That's likely a lower bound, as well, since the figure doesn't include the rape and sexual assault cases that go unreported. Delhi officials responded by banning Uber from operating in the city, but the company last month resumed operations after  applying for a taxi license \u2014 a distinction that has been central to ongoing protests against the service across the globe.\nThe new features are currently available as an update for Android users, and an iOS version will be released soon. For now, the company is piloting them across all cities in India \u2014 where it's seen  tremendous growth \u2014 and will release additional safety features across other cities \"in the coming months.\"\n","Title":"Uber adds SOS button in India following alleged rape | The Verge","Tags":["apps","policy","us-world","tech","transportation\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7157734"]}
