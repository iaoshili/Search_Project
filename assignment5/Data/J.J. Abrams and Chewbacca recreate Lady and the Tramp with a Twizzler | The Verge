{"Main text":"J.J. Abrams and Chewbacca recreate Lady and the Tramp with a Twizzler\nThe Force has Awoken something deep inside of me\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI'm not sure if \"the  new director of Star Wars and the galaxy's most famous Wookiee making out\" was ever the plot of someone's fan fiction prose, but now we kind of know what that would look like.\nLet's back up first. Remember the  ice bucket challenge ? Back then, we used the pain of cold, often solidified water to raise awareness for ALS. What if instead we did something far less jarring and way more awkward? That's the crux of the Twizzler challenge, which was started in support of Autism Awareness Month (which, yes, is this month). Just like the famous spaghetti scene from Lady and the Tramp, two people start on opposite ends of a Twizzler and then eat until they meet in the middle. Then, like the ice bucket challenge, you challenge two more people to do the same. That's the story behind how Jimmy Kimmel and Rihanna shared a piece of licorice rope and then challenged J.J. to do the same.\nBonus for Star Wars fans: keep an eye out for what looks like Boba Fett in the background being a voyeur to the whole proceedings.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
