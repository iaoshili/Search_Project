{"Main text":"PlayStation Now game streaming is coming to Samsung TVs in 2015\nPlaying PlayStation games is no longer tied down to just Sony devices\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung and Sony have struck a deal to bring the latter'sÂ  PlayStation Now game streaming service to select Samsung Smart TV models in 2015. Jointly announced this morning, the partnership makes Samsung the first PS Now licensee and is notable for making it possible to play PlayStation games on non-Sony devices. There's no need for a console to stream from, either: you just open up an app and play the game directly over the internet.\nPlayStation Now is still in its infancy, having been announced at CES 2014 almost a year ago, but its goal has always been to distribute the Sony gaming experience to the widest audience possible. With Samsung dominating the global TV market, it only makes sense for Sony to embed itself in the Smart Hub software shipping out with all of the Korean company's latest televisions.\n\"We can reach a broader audience of consumers who may not own a Playstation console.\"\nMasayasu Ito, Executive VP of Sony Computer Entertainment, explains that \"partnering with Samsung is a key step toward realizing this vision, as we can reach a broader audience of consumers who may not own a PlayStation console to show them why gaming with PlayStation is such a unique and amazing experience.\" For the moment, PS Now streaming is limited to the United States and Canada, and only offers PlayStation 3 games, but that still makes for a library of over 200 titles that's set to only grow as the service matures.\nThe first demonstrations of PlayStation Now on Samsung TVs will take place at CES 2015 in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks, though given Sony's ambitions for the streaming service, it wouldn't be at all surprising to see other big TV makers like LG joining in the fun as well.\n","Title":"PlayStation Now game streaming is coming to Samsung TVs in 2015 | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","hd-home","culture","tech","ces-2015"]}
