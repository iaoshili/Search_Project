{"Main text":"Watch the first trailer for Veep season 4\nHail to the (former) Veep\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTV, especially  DC TV , has been a fun multiverse as of late. TV America has just seen the simultaneous inauguration of two different presidents \u2014 on the darkest timeline, we have President Frank Underwood on  House of Cards , and now on the uncontested funniest timeline, we have President Selina Myer on Veep's fourth season, premiering April 12th on HBO. From the looks of this first full trailer, the latter is going to be far more enjoyable.\nThe last time I laughed so hard I cried was during Selina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her eternally loyal manservant Gary's (Tony Hale) glorious, bloody celebration over POTUS' resignation at the end of season three. It's going to be hard to top that high, but Veep is one of those rare shows that manages to get better and sharper each year. But now that Selina's got a new gig, I wonder if they're going to have to rethink that title?\nUpdate: And here's the key art for the new season.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
