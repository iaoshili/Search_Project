{"Main text":"Keurig's attempt to 'DRM' its coffee cups totally backfired\nA system designed to lock out third-party competitors just enraged consumers\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou know Keurig\u2019s machines. The company's squat black coffee brewers have become fixtures in offices, hotels, and homes around the country, as have garbage cans heaped with the spent plastic pods they use. Purely on the strength of those machines \u2014 or more accurately, the relatively expensive pods they use \u2014 Keurig transformed its parent company, Green Mountain Coffee, from a small regional brewer to a major corporation doing over $4 billion in sales each year.\nLate last year, Keurig announced a new machine, the 2.0, calling it the \"future of brewing\" and touting its ability to make both small cups and large carafes. But another, less-publicized feature has been getting most of the attention: the brewer\u2019s advanced scanning system that locks out any coffee pods not bearing a special mark. It\u2019s essentially a digital rights management system, but for coffee, and it\u2019s proving to be the brewer\u2019s downfall.\n\"Talk about GREEDY corporate ridiculousness.\"\nOn an earnings call Wednesday the company announced that brewer sales fell 12 percent last quarter, the first full quarter for which the 2.0 was on sale. \"Quite simply our 2.0 launch got off to a slower start than we planned,\" said CEO Brian Kelley. He said the company had been too slow to get 2.0-compatible cups onto retail shelves and \"confusion among consumers as to whether the 2.0 would still brew all of their favorite brands.\"\nIndeed, the 2.0\u2019s Amazon reviews overflow with caffeine-deprived fury, the idiosyncratically capitalized wrath of people who bought 2.0 machines only to find that their old cups don\u2019t work. \"Talk about GREEDY corporate ridiculousness,\" said one guy who tried to use his refillable pods. \"On principle alone, I hate that they are dictating which coffee I'm using in my machine,\" said another. \"It is a HUGE SHAME that the company decided to remove the ability to use your own coffee grounds in the home brew k-cup. ...They should have just said we made these changes so our products would sell more so we could make a bigger profit,\" reads a typical review. \"They took a potentially killer machine and added horrible DRM - a rights management system, in the greedy attempt to get all other coffee pod manufacturers to pay them so their pods work,\" reads another of the hundreds of one-star reviews. Many lamented the ability to give no stars. If you Google \"Keurig 2.0,\" the first thing that autocompletes is \" hack .\"\n\"I hate that they are dictating which coffee I'm using in my machine.\"\nThe funniest thing about the backlash is that it was entirely predictable. Consumers hate DRM \u2014 in music, in movies, in anything \u2014 but applying it to coffee feels especially galling. It\u2019s the most open caffeinated beverage there is; all you need is beans and hot water and, I guess, a vessel to brew it in. Locking it up in plastic cups was already a little silly, though something lots of people were happy to buy for the sake of convenience. Building a complicated infrared scanning system so that you can only use Keurig-approved cups was a step too far.\nAt a Keurig 2.0 launch event last June , company representatives demonstrated the DRM system using old Keurig pods, without the scannable ink markers. If you tried to use one, the machine displayed a message saying \"oops\" and did nothing. It was designed to lock out cups made by third parties, but obviously it also locked out old Keurig ones, as the demonstration made clear. I asked whether that would be a problem, and no one seemed to think it would be. The old cups would be phased out, and retailers would carry only the new ones, Keurig said. That turned out to be wrong, possibly because so many Keurig users buy their cups in bulk, and probably because unlicensed pods were cheaper. Maybe the problems will subside somewhat now that retailers are stocking the new cups, but as Kelly acknowledged in the call, the initial angry response did a lot of damage.\nIt\u2019s the most open caffeinated beverage there is\nKeurig says the scanning system allows the machine to optimize brew temperature for different types of cups, and to tell the difference between carafe-size cups and regular ones. But at the event, a Keurig engineer said the technology is based on anti-counterfeiting technology used by the US Mint, which surely is not the simplest way of distinguishing between one pod and another.\nAt a corporate level, Keurig\u2019s attempt to make a DRM system for its coffee is understandable. The company\u2019s business model depends on selling its brewers cheap and making money selling pods, a model reminiscent of printer manufacturers and their marked-up ink cartridges. It\u2019s a tremendously lucrative business. Of Keurig\u2019s $1.4 billion in sales last quarter, $1 billion came from selling cups . But in 2012, key patents on its cups expired, and competitors rushed in, selling compatible cups for cheaper and quickly eating into Keurig\u2019s market share .\nYou shouldn't have to hack your coffee\nMany of these companies have declared their intention to make 2.0-compatible cups. Others have sued . Yet another third-party cup manufacturer is giving away a free clip that it says tricks Keurig\u2019s scanner. And YouTube is full of videos showing how to hack the system.\nWhether this stuff works is sort of beside the point. You shouldn\u2019t have to hack your coffee, and that\u2019s especially true for a company whose entire success is based on being super easy and convenient. Keurig\u2019s latest earnings report proves that.\nVerge Video from CES 2015: Samsung's virtual stovetop cooks with LED flames\n","Title":"Keurig's attempt to 'DRM' its coffee cups totally backfired | The Verge","Tags":["business","tech"]}
