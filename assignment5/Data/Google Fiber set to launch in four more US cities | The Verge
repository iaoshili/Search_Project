It's not yet clear what kind of deals the cities will get \u2014 Google has yet to comment \u2014 but it's likely that customers will be able to get gigabit internet for around $80 per month, the same price as customers in Kansas City, where the service first launched in 2012. People in the new areas can expect Google to take around a year to build the requisite infrastructure for fiber-optic internet, but not every neighborhood will receive it \u2014 interest is gauged by area, and the company won't lay down the network if it doesn't get enough of a response.\nGoogle currently offers Fiber internet  in Austin, TX , and  Provo, UT , in addition to Kansas City, but the company has been openly considering extending its Fiber service for some time now,  identifying nine metropolitan areas as potential expansion areas in February of last year. Of the nine, the four new sites are the furthest east, but Google says that the move won't halt Fiber's expansion to the west of the country. David Vossbrink, a spokesperson for San Jose, said that Google officials told him that the new announcements \"should not be considered the end of the road for the other areas.\"\nVerge Video Archives: Google's Tense Alliance to Hook Up Kansas City's Poor (Detours, Season 1)\n","Title":"Google Fiber set to launch in four more US cities | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"2953031"]}
