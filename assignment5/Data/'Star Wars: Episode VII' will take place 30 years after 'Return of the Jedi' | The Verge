{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA new Star Wars film is getting closer by the day, and  Lucasfilm and Disney have just announced some new information on the status of the production. Episode VII \u2014 co-written and directed by J.J. Abrams \u2014 is set to begin shooting this May at Pinewood Studios in London. For the first time, however, the team is giving an indication of what fans can expect to see when the  film hits theaters in 2015 . According to today's release, it will take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi, which capped off the original Star Wars trilogy, and \"will star a trio of new young leads along with some very familiar faces.\"\nThe latter reference is no doubt a nod to what has been rumored for months: that Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill could return to the franchise to reprise their roles as Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Luke Skywalker. Jedi came out in 1983, just over 30 years ago, which would bring the ages of the older actors and their characters right into alignment. As for that new trio of leads, casting rumors have been running rampant, with Adam Driver (Girls) recently named as a  likely candidate to play the villain . None of the casting information has been confirmed just yet, but with May the 4th \u2014 unofficially known as \"Star Wars day\" \u2014 and San Diego Comic-Con coming up, we wouldn't be surprised to see some very big announcements made before the end of summer.\n","Title":"'Star Wars: Episode VII' will take place 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
