{"Main text":"I nominate the following for best correction in the New York Times\nWelcome to Good Burger, home of the Good Burger, may I correct your story?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAn article on Thursday about the latest Internet sensation of \"Alex from Target,\" a picture of a teenager bagging merchandise at the retailer that went viral online, described incorrectly a subsequent Internet posting of \"Kel from Good Burger.\" It was a frame from the 1997 film \"Good Burger\" starring the actor Kel Mitchell; it was not a photograph of a teenager in a job.\nThe above quote is a correction to The New York Times story,  \"Known as 'Alex From Target,' Teenage Clerk Rises to Star on Twitter and Talk Shows.\" I believe it's one of the finest corrections ever published in The New York Times. Let me explain why, then I'll offer a few corrections that rival its beauty.\nWhy is it a masterpiece?\nThe correction pertains to an already absurd story about a teenager who is only famous for looking like a more famous teenager, and who may be part of a stealth advertising campaign for his employer. So it's a story about what may be an advertisement disguised as a social media phenomenon about a celebrity who became a phenomenon through social media. But what elevates the story from commentary on the internet to microcosm of the internet, is that it should contain a troll of consumerism using a still from a movie literally about the perils of consumerism.\nThis story, correction and all, is the internet as ouroboros.\nEverything else about the correction \u2014 the Kel Mitchell shout-out, the proper New York Times style referencing Good Burger, the phrase \"a teenager in a job\" \u2014 adds extra flavor just like  Ed's secret sauce .\nHas The New York Times posted a better correction?\nNavigating Love and Autism\nAn article on Monday about Jack Robinson and Kirsten Lindsmith, two college students with Asperger syndrome who are navigating the perils of an intimate relationship, misidentified the character from the animated children's TV show \"My Little Pony\" that Ms. Lindsmith said she visualized to cheer herself up. It is Twilight Sparkle, the nerdy intellectual, not Fluttershy, the kind animal lover.\nThis Boy Band's Already Supersized\nAn article last Sunday about the documentary maker Morgan Spurlock, who has a new film out on the boy band One Direction, misstated the subject of his 2012 movie \"Mansome.\" It is about male grooming, not Charles Manson. The article also misspelled the name of the production company of Simon Cowell, on whose \"X Factor\" talent competition show One Direction was created. The company is Syco, not Psycho.\n","Title":"I nominate the following for best correction in the New York Times | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
