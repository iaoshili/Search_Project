{"Main text":"The 'Star Wars' prequels get the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' treatment\nJar Jar is marked for death\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOnce you've struck gold with a successful YouTube mashup, there's only one way to follow it up: a prequel with more CGI, more pod racing, and a hyperactive rastafarian lizard used as comic relief. So naturally, after YouTube critic The Unusual Suspect had a hit mashing up the Guardians of the Galaxy trailer with clips for the original Star Wars trilogy , it was only a matter of time before he moved on to the prequels. The result leans on the same swashbuckling musical cues \u2014 Blue Swede's \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and Norman Greenbaum's \"Spirit in the Sky\" \u2014 but swaps Han for a computerized Yoda and Leia for Padme. Naturally, Jar Jar is sentenced to death within the first minute.\nUpdate 11:50AM ET: An earlier version of this post stated that Spirit in the Sky was performed by Steve Miller. It's actually by Norman Greenbaum.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
