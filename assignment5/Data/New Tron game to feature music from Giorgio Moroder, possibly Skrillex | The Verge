{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLegendary Italian dance music pioneer Giorgio Moroder is providing the music for an as-yet-unannounced video game adaptation of the Tron movie reboot.  In an interview with Clash Music , Moroder \u2014 also known for his work on movies such as Scarface \u2014 said he had already produced five themes of \"electronic stuff\" for the game and would be meeting with dubstep evangelist and uneven haircut-wearer Skrillex to discuss possible remixes.\nThe game is still technically unannounced\nDisney's last Tron video game was Tron: Evolution, released in 2010 \u2014 the same year the company released Tron: Legacy, the movie sequel to the original 1982 sci-fi classic. Disney  is reportedly planning to release another Tron movie in 2015, but has yet to detail that movie's plot, or the video game Moroder says it has in the works. The composer, producer, and hitmaker says he was recruited to provide the music for the game, but doesn't specify whether we can expect a third-person shooter in the same vein as the acceptable Tron: Evolution, or something else.\nBut Moroder's comments do show that, decades after he helped define disco, he remains a committed futurist. Speaking to Clash Music, he explains how he's always keen to pursue new projects and get his music out to new audiences \u2014 at 74, Moroder began a series of DJ appearances, traveling the world to play to club crowds. He's also started learning how to use Pro Tools to find new sounds. \"The thing right now is that the sounds you get in the computers are so good and so many that it's almost impossible to find something which is new,\" he says. \"The music has to be new.\"\n","Title":"New Tron game to feature music from Giorgio Moroder, possibly Skrillex | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
