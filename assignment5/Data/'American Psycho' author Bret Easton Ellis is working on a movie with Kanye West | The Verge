{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKanye West has never bothered limiting himself to a single medium like music, and it looks like he's currently working on a film project with one of the most controversial novelists of the 1980s. In an  interview with Vice , novelist Bret Easton Ellis \u2014 the author of Less Than Zero and American Psycho, and the screenwriter of The Canyons \u2014 reveals that he was approached by West to work on a film project last year. \"I didn't want to at first,\" Ellis recounts. \"Then I listened to Yeezus.\"\nEllis says he found the album so compelling he decided he wanted to work with West right away, and while the script has since been written he couldn't provide any additional details. \"It's in Kanye Land,\" he says, \"and that's subject to a whole other time frame.\" This actually isn't the first time  Ellis has alluded to the mysterious project, but the fact that Yeezus helped tip the author over the edge may provide a little insight into the feel of the project. It's a creative pairing of two of the most polarizing media personalities out there, and while it's not clear when further details will emerge we can already get a sense of how their sensibilities merge in West's  remixed trailer for The Canyons and his  appearance on Bret Easton Ellis' podcast .\n","Title":"'American Psycho' author Bret Easton Ellis is working on a movie with Kanye West | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
