{"Main text":"Uber bows to the blizzard, will cap surge prices on the East Coast\nNot that you should be traveling anyway\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber has capped the amount of money East Coast riders can expect to pay during the upcoming blizzard,  Bloomberg reports . The blizzard is set to drop  more than 30 inches of snow in parts of the Northeast between today and tomorrow.\nUber CEO Travis Kalanick has defended the practice of price surging \u2014 in which the price of a ride inflates with demand \u2014  claiming it incentivizes speedy pick-ups from drivers. But, after drawing criticism for escalating prices during 2012's Hurricane Sandy and charging customers in Sydney $100 (AUD) to  escape an armed hostage crisis last year, it seems the taxi company is finally learning from its PR blunders. In an email to riders  obtained by TechCrunch , Uber said New York City prices during the storm will not exceed 2.8 times the normal fare.\nThe NY attorney general's office will monitor the company\nThis is the most recent effort by Uber to boost public support \u2014 a solid move considering consumers have shown  little patience for price-gouging . Last year, Uber reached an agreement with the New York attorney general's office, saying it would  cap surge pricing during emergencies on a national level.\nElizabeth DeBold, the New York attorney general's deputy press secretary,  told Business Insider the office will be \"monitoring all providers of essential services, including transportation, for price gouging,\" during the storm.\nUber said in a  statement to Bloomberg that it would be donating all proceeds collected during the storm to the American Red Cross. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio  said yesterday the blizzard could be the \"biggest snowstorm in the history of New York City,\" so traveling at all should be a last resort.\n","Title":"Uber bows to the blizzard, will cap surge prices on the East Coast | The Verge","Tags":["business","transportation"]}
