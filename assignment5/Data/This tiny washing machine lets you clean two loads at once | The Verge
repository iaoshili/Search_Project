At CES 2015 in Las Vegas, LG just unveiled the most exciting clothes washing tech in years: a washing machine that hides underneath your current machine so you can do two loads at once. Appropriately called the Twin Wash System, the new, smaller washer sits under your current machine like big metal drawer, and LG explains that it's \"perfect for delicate items that require special attention or unique wash settings.\"\nThe new washer is compatible with any front-loading LG washing machine, including older ones, and features built-in Smart Diagnosis tech that LG claims can find technical issues and fix them quickly to avoid bigger headaches down the road. \"One might be tempted to call the LG Twin Wash system disruptive, as it's a completely new concept in appliances,\" Seong-jin Jo, LG's CEO, says. Unfortunately there's no word on when the new washer will be available, or how much it will set you back.\n. @LGUS shows off a new mini washer inside another washer. It is backward compatible with other LG washers. #CES2015 pic.twitter.com\/uu5C55KFVA\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
