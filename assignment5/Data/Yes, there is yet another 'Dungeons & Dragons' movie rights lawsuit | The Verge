Today brings news of a similar fight  happening at a higher level : a trial date has been set in the battle between Hasbro and Sweatpea Entertainment over the rights to a live action D&D movie.\n\"Sweetpea alleges that it has the license to make a Dungeons & Dragons movie, while Hasbro contends that that license has expired,\" reports The Escapist. The companies were unable to reach an agreement, so to court they will go on September 16th.\nWhy all the sudden D&D fervor?\nWhy all the sudden D&D fervor? Wizards of the Coast, which bought TSR, the company that invented Dungeons & Dragons, just introduced a new edition of D&D in the hopes of  revitalizing the franchise .
