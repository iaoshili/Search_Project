{"Main text":"James Bond's submarine car is on sale on eBay for $1 million\nElon Musk has one, of course\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmong James Bond's many glorious gadgets over the years, one that stands out even to this day is his submarine car from The Spy Who Loved Me (1977): a modified 1977 Lotus Espirit S1 sportscar that was shown driving directly from land into water. In real life, there was no such transforming amphibious vehicle: seven different cars were used to create the submarine scenes in the film \u2014 one of them being little more than an  Espirit-shaped shell wrapped around a working submarine . Now you can own one of the three other remaining land models for a fitting $1 million.  Hot Rod City , a vintage car restoration and resale shop in Las Vegas, is  selling a prop Lotus Espirit from the film  on eBay . Unfortunately, the vehicle doesn't actually drive (nor does it submerge), and isn't street legal, as the eBay listing makes clear. Yet it is the one that was used for a retracting wheel scene in the film, and even had a second moment of stardom when it was rehabbed on the History channel TV show  American Restoration . And if anyone pulls the trigger and buys this thing, they will be in good company: Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors,  purchased one of his own last year and said he planned to modify it so that it could transform for real.\n","Title":"James Bond's submarine car is on sale on eBay for $1 million | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","transportation"]}
