Perhaps most interesting was the look we got at how users might manage the many potential phone configurations that Project Ara makes possible.\nThe Ara Configurator, shown off running on a standard Android phone, is the way that users can build out and order phones, and it looked like a pretty nice bit of software at first glance. It's not entirely dissimilar to the concept of Moto Maker \u2014 it walks you through designing each aspect of the phone, from the stylized exterior \"shells\" to the all-important modules and \"endo\" frame of the device.\nThe app is built with Material Design and lets you pinch the screen to move between the three distinct layers of customization. For example, if you're looking at the back of your Project Ara phone and the customized colored modules, you can pinch to move a layer down \u2014 this reveals exactly which modules you have selected and lets you remove or add additional ones.\nCustomize every layer of your new phone\nSwiping left and right lets you move through a summary of your phone \u2014 you start at the market, with all of its options open to you. From there, you can save particular modules you're interested in to your \"stash.\" Then you actually build the phone itself; the final screen shows your creation, how much it costs, and some key specs like estimated battery life. You can place your order right there.\nFor those who are less inclined to build their own phone from scratch, Google will also offer pre-built options through its \"simple phone maker\"; there's also an option to customize your shells with your own photographs. We only got to see small bits of this whole process, but it's good to see Google already thinking about how it'll sell Project Ara \u2014 using the Moto Maker was certainly a fun processes, and it'll probably be even better to truly customize the guts of an Ara smartphone.\nVerge Video Archives: A Look Inside Google's Secretive ATAP Group\n","Title":"The Ara Configurator app is how you'll build your custom Project Ara smartphone | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5366009"]}
