It's a complaint most often lobbed at action films, where the heroes can feel like robots turned on moments before the film begins and turned off during the credits. It's a silly request for a 90-minute movie to stop while its hero waits for an elevator, but it's not the worst request. We may not fight evil empires, but we eat three meals a day and, you know, evacuate those meals with some regularity. The rituals of everyday life, like buying coffee and taking off shoes, are familiar and they help to humanize characters.\nSomething can be boring, but cool at the same time\nThis supercut of interfaces in Star Wars: A New Hope is like a rapid fire of these seemingly insignificant moments that ground the characters in a relatable world \u2014 important for a film set against a fictional space war in which foot soldiers wear plastic body suits that look like stacks of squished, stale marshmallows. Dino Ignacio created the short for educational purposes , which makes sense: the artist served as the user experience director on the Dead Space video game trilogy.\n\"This is a supercut of all the moments in A New Hope where characters interacted with machines, doors, screens, levers, knobs and buttons,\" reads the description on the video's Vimeo page. The footage is from Harmy's Despecialized Edition of the film,Â  which is it's own interesting story .\n","Title":"Watch a supercut of every user interface from Star Wars: A New Hope | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","watch-this","entertainment"]}
