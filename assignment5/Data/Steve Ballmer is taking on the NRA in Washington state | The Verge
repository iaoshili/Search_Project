{"Main text":"Steve Ballmer is taking on the NRA in Washington state\nThe former Microsoft CEO and other tech titans are backing a gun control initiative\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe big news about former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer this week was his  purchase of the Clippers for $2 billion, but it appears he's dipped into the coffers recently for political activism, too. According to newly released financial disclosures, Ballmer and his wife, Connie, have poured $580,000 into gun control efforts in Washington state.\nThe initiative has raised about $3.4 million\nFollowing  the Sandy Hook shootings , gun control advocates proposed a ballot initiative to close loopholes that allow for background check-free purchases of firearms, if the purchases are made online or at gun shows. Because of Ballmer \u2014 and other ex-Microsoft bigshots including Bill Gates and Jon Shirley, who have made smaller donations \u2014 the initiative is now significantly outpacing a competing gun-rights campaign, at about $3.4 million to $1.1 million. Tech industry luminaries based outside of Washington have also chipped in; Pandora CEO Brian McAndrews, for example, contributed $10,000.\nIn  an interview with Bloomberg , Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the competing Protect Our Gun Rights campaign, sounded resigned to losing a funding battle. \"We\u2019re going to be outspent,\" he said. \"We recognize that.\" The initiative comes up for a vote this November.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
