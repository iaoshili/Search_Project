{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle staked a claim in one of the most ad-saturated neighborhoods in the world this week with a billboard the width of a city block. After signing a long-term deal with Vornado Realty Trust reportedly worth millions, the company began advertising on the biggest billboard in New York City's Times Square \u2014 over 20 million pixels big.\nThe Mitsubishi Electric screen occupies the entire block of Broadway that lies between 45th and 46th street, and even wraps about another 30 feet around each corner. Its true resolution is 2,368 x 10,048, and it measures over 77 feet tall by 323 feet long. It will reportedly be under Google's control until the end of January 2015.\nGoogle Street View images of the billboard's construction from May and September 2014\nThe rotating series of graphics on the eight-story-tall screen promote many of Google's best known offerings, like Google Maps and Android. The latter dominates the billboard, provoking passersby to \" Androidify \" themselves by creating a personalized version of the Android Robot with an Android tablet-equipped employee on the ground. Each person's creation eventually appears somewhere on the billboard, and while people wait there are options to get a postcard or shirt emblazoned with their newly-created likeness.\nIf you're on the block it occupies, the billboard easily towers over you. When you're up extremely close to it you're even likely to feel a quick hit of vertigo. It's the kind of thing that almost singularly stands out from the visual din \u2014 until it disappears as you walk a few blocks away past the unlicensed Elmos and find a bigger crowd staring at a Revlon billboard one-fifth the size.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe billboard is located on Broadway between 45th and 46th streets in Times Square\nAbove and behind the billboard is the Marriott Marquis hotel\nThe LED screen contains almost 24 million pixels, with a resolution of 2,368 x 10,048\nEven the panels that wrap around the corners are massive, measuring the same 77 feet tall and about 30 feet wide\nThere are about a dozen differently designed Android robots underneath the billboard, which passersby often took selfies with\nIt's hard to discern the actual pixels until you're right under the massive screen\nUnderneath the billboard are New York-themed and celebrity Android robots, like this one of Whoopi Goldberg\nAndroid ads dominate the billboard, which occasionally promotes things like Google Maps, too\nMore Android robot sculptures face the north end of Times Square right next to where visitors are able to get in line for a custom postcard\nAt this station visitors are able to print a postcard that features a picture of themselves next to the Android robot likeness they create\nVisitors can also wait on these wooden risers for their likeness to appear on the 77-foot-tall screen\nThe traditional Android robot is on display as well, and it can be found atop the postcard station\nTypical Times Square buskers like this Statue of Liberty are taking advantage of the crowds drawn by the billboard by hovering nearby and offering to pose for pictures\nConstruction workers on their lunch break gaze up at the giant LED display\nThe billboard is enormous, but once you're south of 45th street it begins to blend into the busy scene\nWith Google now occupying much of the space between 45th and 46th streets, the unlicensed cartoon characters pose for tips one block south from their normal spot\n","Title":"This is Google's massive Android billboard in Times Square | The Verge","Tags":["google","photo-essay","tech"]}
