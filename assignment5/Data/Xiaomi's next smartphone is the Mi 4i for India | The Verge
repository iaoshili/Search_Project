{"Main text":"Xiaomi's next smartphone is the Mi 4i for India\nA faster processor and a lower price are joined by a new plastic body\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKunal Dua is the Editorial Head at NDTV Gadgets , the largest India-based technology news website with over 19 million monthly unique readers around the globe.\nXiaomi unveiled the Mi 4i smartphone on Thursday in New Delhi, India \u2014 its first major launch event outside of its homeland China. \"The 'i' stands for India,\" said Barra, while unveiling what the company is calling its new flagship for India. \"Of course when I go to Indonesia, the 'i' will be for Indonesia,\" he said, before adding a half-hearted, \"I'm just kidding.\"\nAll the elements you associate with a Xiaomi launch event were present: Hugo Barra on stage doing his best Steve Jobs impression, countless digs at Apple, hysterical \"Mi fans\" in attendance, constant comparisons in which the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus came out second best to the star of the show, and of course local as well as international tech media and bloggers in attendance. Did we mention the digs at Apple?\nThe Mi 4i isn't a radical departure from the Mi 4 in terms of design, but there are enough changes to make it perhaps the best-looking Xiaomi phone we've come across to date. The Mi 4\u2019s metal frame has given way to a fully polycarbonate body, but the Mi 4i has more emphasized corners and an overall finish that's reminiscent of high-end Lumia devices. Most importantly, by pricing it at 12,999 rupees (about $205), Xiaomi has ensured it won't be repeating the mistakes it made with the Mi 4, which cost significantly more at launch.\nThe Mi 4i has a faster processor than the Mi 4, but a lower price tag\nThe new phone is powered by a second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, which offers some improvements over the previous generation chip, such as a faster speed. The octa-core processor now has four 1.7GHz cores to do the heavy lifting, while four more power-saving 1.1GHz cores handle background activities. Other specifications include a 5-inch 1080p display, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, MiUi 6 based on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, and a 3120mAh battery that's \"designed to give one and a half days of real-world usage.\"\nThe 13-megapixel rear camera features improved HDR capabilities, and the 5-megapixel front camera comes with a \"beautify\" feature that purports to remove blemishes from your selfies. The frequency with which this feature is popping up on new smartphones sums up everything that's wrong with the world today.\n","Title":"Xiaomi's next smartphone is the Mi 4i for India | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
