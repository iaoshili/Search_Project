{"Main text":"An abandoned mall in Bangkok has been overtaken by fish\nTravel writer stumbles upon a deep, dark secret\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere's something particularly eerie about an  abandoned shopping mall . Perhaps it's the stark contrast from its intended purpose: to see such a sterile place once designed to entice throngs of shoppers into its doors, now so completely devoid of any human life, dilapidated and darkened with time. It's basically the very definition of post-apocalyptic. But in the case of the (now ironically named) New World shopping mall in Bangkok, Thailand, abandonment by humans doesn't equate with lifelessness. The mall, which reportedly caught fire in 1999 (rumored to be arson by a competitor), has since flooded with several feet of water and become a paradise for koi and catfish.\nAs seen in these photos from chef \/ travel writer Jesse Rockwell, the resulting \"urban aquarium\" is at once delightful and surreal. Rockwell writes on his travel, photography, and food blog  A Taste of The Road that someone deliberately introduced the fish into the vacant mall, but that locals in Bangkok's old town \"discourage people from visiting it.\" He says he had to wait for a policeman to leave before entering, which makes his resulting images all the more breathtaking.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
