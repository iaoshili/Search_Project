{"Main text":"Obama announces plan to protect power supplies from climate change-related disasters\nInitiatives aimed at helping state, local, and tribal governments respond to drought and other severe weather\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe White House today will announce a package of federal projects to protect coastal areas and rural power supplies from climate change-related disasters. As The New York Times reports , the initiatives will allocate millions of dollars to state, local, and tribal agencies as part of an effort to boost electricity infrastructure and sharpen disaster-response strategies. The plans are based on recommendations made by a 26-person  climate change task force that President Barack Obama  established in November under an executive order.\nUnder one initiative, the Department of Agriculture will dedicate $236.3 million to strengthening electricity-delivery systems in rural areas across eight states, following warnings that severe weather and drought will put extra strain on power companies. An additional $13.1 million will go toward gathering three dimensional mapping data, which will help states craft emergency responses to floods and erosion, while $10 million will be used to help Native American tribes adapt to climate change. Other funds will help rural communities respond to droughts, though officials have not disclosed a precise amount.\nWednesday's announcement marks the latest in a series of moves the Obama administration has taken to combat climate change. Last month, the White House  announced plans to reduce US carbon pollution by 30 percent by 2030, after a federal report  warned that the impacts of climate change are \"now unavoidable.\"\n","Title":"Obama announces plan to protect power supplies from climate change-related disasters | The Verge","Tags":["policy","science","us-world"]}
