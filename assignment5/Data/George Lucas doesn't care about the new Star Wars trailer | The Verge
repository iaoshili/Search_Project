{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe creator of the Star Wars movies hasn't seen the trailer for the new Star Wars movie. In  an interview with Page Six , George Lucas was asked what he thought of  the promising 88-second teaser for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. \"I don't know anything about it,\" he replied. \" I haven't seen it yet.\"\nGeorge Lucas said he was \"not really\" curious to see Episode VII\nLucas said that although he hadn't watched the trailer, he still planned to see Episode VII when it's released in December 2015, explaining that he had avoided the early footage because he liked \"going to the movies and watching the whole thing there.\" Lucas is noted as a creative consultant on the upcoming movie, but despite claims by George's son Jett last year that his father had \"handpicked\" J.J. Abrams to direct The Force Awakens, the elder Lucas said he was \"not really\" curious to see how the Star Trek director had handled the franchise he created.\nIt might be for the best that we'll never see George Lucas' version of Episodes VII, VIII, and IX. Lucas' modern vision of Star Wars \u2014 with a ronto in every marketplace, midichlorians in every Jedi's bloodstream, and a moody dad-ghost crashing every celebratory Ewok feast \u2014 has been the subject of much mockery. Already Abrams has suggested that he's  departing from Lucas' approach to Star Wars, showing a predilection for practical effects and puppets where Lucas preferred squealing CGI slugmen and floppy-eared irritants, and focusing more on character study and development where Lucas' prequel trilogy focused on selling toys to children with rich parents.\nIf, for some morbid reason, you do want to see what Lucas would've done with the Episode VII trailer, take a look at Michael Shanks' amended \"George Lucas Special Edition,\" featuring computer-generated dewbacks, extra TIE fighters, and a host of other extras the Star Wars creator might have added to make the movie \"closer to his original vision.\"\n","Title":"George Lucas doesn't care about the new Star Wars trailer | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
