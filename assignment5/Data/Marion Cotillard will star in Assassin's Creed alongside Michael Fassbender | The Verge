{"Main text":"Marion Cotillard will star in Assassin's Creed alongside Michael Fassbender\nThe movie is set for a December 2016 release\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month we reported that Justin Kurzel's Assassin's Creed film adaptation  was on track for a 2016 theatrical release following several delays caused by script rewrites and scheduling issues . Now Marion Cotillard (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception) has been named as one of the movie's stars along with Michael Fassbender.\nNo word yet on Cotillard's role\nThe movie, based on Ubisoft's popular video games, tells the story Desmond Miles, a bartender who's kidnapped by a corporation that forces him to return to his assassin roots. It's not clear yet which role Cotillard will play in the movie.\nCotillard and Fassbender have worked together before, in the upcoming adaptation of Shakespeare's  Macbeth , which was also directed by Kurzel. That movie will be released later this year.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
