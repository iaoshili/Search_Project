{"Main text":"164 Comments\nCinematographer Wally Pfister first teamed up with Christopher Nolan on Memento, and he\u2019s been a vital part of the director\u2019s team ever since. On films like The Dark Knight and Inception, Pfister\u2019s Oscar-winning visual sensibilities allowed Nolan to crystallize his brand of thinking-person\u2019s blockbuster. Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, then, that when it came time for Pfister to step away and direct a film himself, he opted for a big-budget thriller straight from the Nolan playbook.\nFrom a distance, Transcendence has all the earmarks of success. It stars several Nolan mainstays, features the same kind of meticulous photography and production design we\u2019ve come to expect, and mixes a high-concept premise with an intimate emotional core. But the comparisons end there, as the film collapses into a shambling mess of \u201990s cyber-paranoia and action tropes that not even the charisma of Johnny Depp can redeem.\nThe dying scientist is uploaded to the cloud\nDepp plays Will Caster, a scientist specializing in artificial intelligence. With the help of his wife Evelyn (Rebecca Hall, The Prestige) and best friend Max (an underutilized Paul Bettany), Will has made strides towards creating a sentient computer system called PINN. That\u2019s Physically Independent Neural Network, in case you\u2019re wondering; apparently the WOPR from WarGames was busy.\nCaster\u2019s goal is to reach the point where computers become more intelligent than humans. Futurists like Ray Kurzweil call that moment \"the singularity,\" but Will has his own name for it: transcendence. An anarchist group named RIFT (Revolutionary Independence From Technology) doesn\u2019t share Will\u2019s vision, however, and in order to halt progress the group organizes a series of research-lab attacks that culminate with Will being shot. Desperate to save her dying husband, Evelyn uploads Will\u2019s consciousness into PINN. The resulting Depp \/ computer hybrid is a new kind of self-aware intelligence, and once set loose online it\u2019s able to evolve, grow, and change the world as he \u2014 or it \u2014 sees fits.\nDepp seems disinterested without a crazy costume to play with\nSimilar ground has been covered in bad \u201990s movies like Virtuosity and The Lawnmower Man , but the spectre of cyber-thrillers past doesn\u2019t doom Transcendence. The problem here is that Transcendence seems to think it was actually made in the 1990s. PINN sounds smart enough to pass the Turing test, but Siri does a better job at speech synthesis. Digital Will has access to nearly unlimited computing power, but he\u2019s unable to generate a photo-realistic image of himself \u2014 presumably because a glitchy version feels more \"cyber\" to audiences. It\u2019s the kind of movie where the good guys plan to solve a problem by \"hacking\" a system and uploading a magical computer virus, and Y2K doomsday fears are used as a casual reference point.\nThe talented cast isn\u2019t able to counterbalance the film\u2019s technological tone-deafness, either. Depp seems disinterested without a crazy costume or affectation to play with, and while Rebecca Hall is wonderful as his grief-stricken wife, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the duo have no chemistry together \u2014 even before Will is shot and turned into snow on a monitor. The same is true for Bettany, Morgan Freeman, and Cillian Murphy, all exceptional actors who at times feel like they\u2019re starring in outtakes from entirely different movies.\nTranscendence is confused, playing as a story about loss one moment, a technological cautionary tale the next, and a thundering action ride 20 minutes later. Mixing tones like that isn\u2019t impossible \u2014 Nolan\u2019s films are master classes in the balancing act \u2014 but it does require a singular vision to bring all the disparate pieces together. Transcendence never approaches that kind of cohesion, with characters and plotlines vanishing and then resurfacing almost at will. There are so many jarring jumps and missing beats that one wonders if the film hasn\u2019t undergone some heavy re-tinkering on its way to theaters, particularly as the action elements are haphazardly shoved to the forefront.\nMost frustrating of all is that there are isolated moments that do work. Evelyn\u2019s storyline is certainly compelling, the visuals are lush, and the concerns the film raises about technology run amok are more relevant in 2014 than they\u2019ve ever been. If you squint, you can almost see the layered, poignant blockbuster that Transcendence wanted to be \u2014 and perhaps could have been, if guided with a steadier hand. Instead it\u2019s an utterly inert film that leaves no impression, even after throwing idea after idea up on the screen.\nTranscendence opens Friday, April 18th.
