{"Main text":"Neil deGrasse Tyson seemed to enjoy 'Interstellar,' according to his Twitter analysis\nThe charismatic astrophysicist and 'Cosmos' host liked the science in the movie, not so much the plot\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWarning: spoilers for Interstellar lie ahead\nNeil deGrasse Tyson sparked a fierce debate with his  Twitter review of the movie Gravity last year and now he's returned to share his thoughts on this fall's ambitious new sci-fi spectacle Interstellar. In a series of  tweets deGrasse Tyson posted last night , the famed astrophysicist and  host of the revived TV show Cosmos shared his informed take on the science of the film, finding much to love \u2014 and some to nitpick, especially with the plot. He qualified it all afterward with a  tweet reminding his followers he's not a professional movie critic: \"Never look to me for opinions on new films. All I do is highlight the science one might or might not find in them.\" That said, deGrasse Tyson's analysis  provides some added context for those who want to understand more about the theoretical physics that informed the film. If you've already seen the movie or don't care to have it spoiled, read on for some of his most illuminating takes. And be sure to check out  The Verge's own discussion on the issues in Interstellar .\nIn #Interstellar , if you didn\u2019t understand the physics, try Kip Thorne\u2019s highly readable Bbook \"The Science of Interstellar\"\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nIt's already been well publicized that Interstellar director Christopher Nolan and his fellow screenwriter (and brother) Jonathan Nolan leaned heavily on the theories of American astrophysicist Kip Thorne to craft the film's story. Thorne met with the director constantly over a five month period to discuss how to craft realistic special effects for the space travel scenes, according to  The New York Times Magazine . In fact, not only is Thorne credited as an executive producer on the film, but a key character is also named after Thorne, as deGrasse Tyson points out.\nIn #Interstellar : There\u2019s a robot named KIPP. One of the Executive Producers, a physicist, is named Kip. I\u2019m just saying.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nAs such, Thorne's contribution to the movie seems to have paid off, at least when it comes to scientific viability. As deGrasse Tyson points out:\nIn #Interstellar : You enter a 3-Dimensional portal in space. Yes, you can fall in from any direction. Yes, it\u2019s a Worm Hole.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nThorne isn't the only physicist whose theories make Interstellar so scientifically sound. Pointing out a key plot point that revolves around the  Twin Paradox , deGrasse Tyson writes:\nIn #Interstellar : Experience Einstein\u2019s Relativity of Time as no other feature film has shown.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nIn #Interstellar : And in the real universe, strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nIn #Interstellar : Experience Einstein's Curvature of Space as no other feature film has shown.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nHe further praises Interstellar's depiction of a black hole and its effects on nearby planetary bodies:\nIn #Interstellar : You observe great Tidal Waves from great Tidal Forces, of magnitude that orbiting a Black Hole might create\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nOf course, that doesn't mean he wants to visit one anytime soon:\nIn #Interstellar : They explore a planet near a Black Hole. Personally, I\u2019d stay as far the hell away from BlackHoles as I can\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nHe points out some geek trivia for fans of another sci-fi epic:\nIn #Interstellar : They reprise the matched-rotation docking maneuver from \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" but they spin 100x faster.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nA persistent advocate of diversity in STEM fields (science, tech, engineering, math), deGrasse Tyson found a lot to like about the film's casting as well:\nIn #Interstellar : All leading characters, including McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, & Caine play a scientist or engineer.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nIn #Interstellar : Of the leading characters (all of whom are scientists or engineers) half are women. Just an FYI.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nHe did seem to take issue with a few aspects of the movie, however.\nIn #Interstellar : On another planet, around another star, in another part of the galaxy, two guys get into a fist fight.\n\u2014 Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 10, 2014\nIn #Interstellar , if you didn\u2019t understand the plot, there is no published book to help you.\n","Title":"Neil deGrasse Tyson seemed to enjoy 'Interstellar,' according to his Twitter analysis | The Verge","Tags":["culture","science","entertainment"]}
