{"Main text":"Panda Bear is launching his new album through a global radio experiment\nPremiering songs in countries around the world\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn 2015, the age of Beyoncé surprise releases and pay-what-you-want business models, we're almost used to album experiments. But indie auteur Panda Bear has a new idea for an old medium: the radio.\nStarting today, Mr. Bear is launching  a global radio campaign where songs from his forthcoming album, Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, are played one-by-one on stations throughout the world. The project kicked off today with \"Sequential Circuits,\" played during  Mary Anne Hobbs' BBC Radio 6 Music show (you can hear the interview and song starting at about 1 hour and 23 minutes).\nAn interactive map has a complete list of the tracks, times, and countries still coming over the next couple of days, if you plan on tuning in, or want to book a flight to Portugal. While you wait, listen to the single \"Mr. Noah\" below.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
