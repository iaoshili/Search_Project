We think it\u2019s the first subscription service to really get it right.\" Whatever Reznor's formal position is, Apple hasn't yet hinted at bringing him into the fold.\nUpdate 4pm ET: Trent Reznor confirmed on Twitter this afternoon that he is still the Chief Creative Officer for Beats, putting previous rumors to rest.\n...but YES I am still CCO of Beats Music and looking forward to what lies ahead with Apple.\n","Title":"Trent Reznor still working at Beats, though his role at Apple is unclear | The Verge","Tags":["apple","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
