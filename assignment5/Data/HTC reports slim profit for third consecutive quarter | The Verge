The Taiwanese firm announced profits of $15.9 million from revenues of $1.5 billion in the quarter ending December 31st, 2014, with CEO Peter Chou describing it as a \"solid platform\" on which to continue building a new range of \"mobile lifestyle\" products.

HTC is now on its third consecutive profitable quarter, and its revenue is up 12 percent year on year. It's a far cry from the heady days of 2011 when HTC  was the leading smartphone brand in the US , but investors will probably be pleased just to see any profit at all. The company has been dealing with long-term  upheaval in high-ranking personnel for years now, and it's still adapting to the threat from  Chinese smartphone vendors like Xiaomi . Nevertheless, HTC appears confident about its future and is even promising to deliver \" utopia in progress \" with the launch of its next flagship smartphone on March 1st.\n","Title":"HTC reports slim profit for third consecutive quarter | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","business","tech"]}
