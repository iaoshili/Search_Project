The books were originally produced by publisher Dark Horse, but Marvel has since taken over those duties now that it has become the new home for Star Wars comics, a move that was  announced more than a year ago . Dark Horse had previously been the home of Star Wars comics since 1991, and moving forward Marvel will be producing its own, new comics based in the sci-fi universe,  the first of which is set to debut next week . The shift in publisher coincides with a huge year for the Star Wars franchise, which will culminate in  the release of a brand new film , The Force Awakens, on December 18th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
