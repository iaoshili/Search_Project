{"Main text":"Emptiness is the dark heart of 'Seinfeld'\nNew York City has never felt so desolate\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere's no doubt that a dark current ran through Seinfeld, one of the funniest and most successful sitcoms of all time. The soundtrack and antics of Kramer and George gave it a lighthearted face, and many of the plot points were entirely absurd \u2014 but at its core, the show was a tale of four dysfunctional, unhappy residents of the modern age. A new Seinfeld-based supercut exposes that core in a rather unexpected way \u2014 \"Nothing\" is a 6-minute cut of clips from Seinfeld showing an empty, somewhat desolate New York City, accompanied only by the show's bobbing soundtrack and the cruel, callous sound of the laugh track. It's a video that transcends Seinfeld \u2014 anyone who has lived in a big city can relate to the conceit of being isolated in a city, despite being surrounded by hundreds of thousands of people.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
