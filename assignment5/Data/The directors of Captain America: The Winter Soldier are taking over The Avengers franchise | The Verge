{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJoss Whedon is stepping down from The Avengers franchise after Age of Ultron comes out this May, but Marvel has sewn up just about the best replacements possible for the next two installments: the Russo brothers.  The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that Joe and Anthony Russo will be taking on both parts of Avengers: Infinity War, which the duo will be filming in one massive shoot starting next year. Badass Digest first reported the news.\nThe Russos originally made their stamp on the Marvel universe with  Captain America: The Winter Soldier . That film took what had been one of the goofier franchises in the studio's arsenal, and turned it into a surprising, '70s-era spy thriller. While the Russos' background was in comedy \u2014 they directed episodes of Arrested Development and Community \u2014 Winter Solider proved they could balance those skills with an eye for character and a deft hand when it came to action choreography.\nThe success of Soldier has made them some of the most sought-after young directors working today. They've since been  linked to a new Ghostbusters film , and they reportedly  expressed interested in taking on Spider-Man in some capacity as well. With the new deal in place, however, they'll be busy for quite a while \u2014 the first installment of Avengers: Infinity War Part II will be arriving in 2018, with Part 2 scheduled to open in 2019.\nVox Video: All the Easter Eggs in The Age of Ultron trailer\n","Title":"The directors of Captain America: The Winter Soldier are taking over The Avengers franchise | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
