{"Main text":"Google's new wireless service will reportedly only work on the Nexus 6\nA limited offering\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe wireless service that Google all but confirmed this week will only work on the Nexus 6 smartphone, according to a new report. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources familiar with the matter, says Google's service  could launch as soon as late March . But it won't work with any phone other than Google's current flagship device, which is manufactured by Motorola Mobility.\nDuring an appearance at Mobile World Congress on Monday, Google's Sundar Pichai said Google is working with \"existing partners\" to create an MVNO, a type of wireless service built on top of infrastructure owned by other carriers. The Journal reported that Google's service, which will switch between cellular networks and Wi-Fi, will be built on top of T-Mobile and Sprint's US networks.\nWhy limit Google's wireless service to the Nexus 6? The Journal suggests that building a phone that works well on an MVNO requires seamless integration between hardware and software, and other manufacturers often modify Android. Another possible reason: Pichai indicated Monday that Google intends to keep the service small \u2014 \"We don't intend to become a carrier at scale,\" he said. Limiting your network to a single phone would be one good way to do that.\nVerge Video Archives: Nexus 6 Review\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
