{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSmartwatches have been discussed extensively for their hardware and software designs , but the Full Screen exhibition at the XPO Gallery in Paris, France, is celebrating the art their screens can display. Hanging from the walls of the gallery are 12 Galaxy Gear smartwatches , all of which have custom, screen-based artwork from different artists. Vincent Broquaire made the Minute After Minute animation, which shows what seems to be the sands of time piling up on the screen. Raquel Meyers presents Aztec Ballad, an animation she made in her signature carpet woven digital style. Visitors can watch the video animation on the smartwatch screen, showing Meyers' cursor rearranging and creating the final animation piece by piece \u2014 it's a process she calls \u201C keyboardslöjd ,\" or drawing and crafting by typing.\nThis exhibit focuses on the powers and limitations of screens, and how physical screens are slowly becoming obsolete. In contrast to the Gear's high-resolution screen, there's a ten-meter wide low-resolution LED panel screen lying on the exhibit floor that displays all of the artwork on each individual smartwatch. According to the gallery , the juxtaposition of different sized screens is meant to make visitors think about the how digital displays have changed over the years from small, to large, and back to small again \u2014 and what will happen to digital art when screens eventually become extinct.\nPhotography courtesy XPO Gallery, images by Vincianne Verguethen\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nFull Screen exhibit with Galaxy Gear smartwatches\nMinute After Minute by Vincent Broquaire\nSémantique du présent non exhaustif by Paul Souviron; Mist by Sara Ludy; and Deep Burn by Jennifer Chan\nLasertits by Addie Wagenknecht\nAztec Ballad by Raquel Meyers\nLasertits by Addie Wagenknecht\nDeep Burn by Jennifer Chan\nNymph Untying her Sandal by Oliver Laric\nbuggin out by Petra Cortright\nEverything always everywhere.com by Rafael Rozendaal\n","Title":"'Full Screen' exhibit celebrates digital display art using Galaxy Gear smartwatches | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design","tech"]}
