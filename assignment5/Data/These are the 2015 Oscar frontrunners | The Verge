We've updated with our favorites for tonight's awards.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the nominees in all 24 categories of the 2015 Oscars last month, and it all comes to a head tonight. A handful of films have a big presence on this list \u2014 in fact, just about every best picture nominee but Selma shows up in quite a few other categories. On the other hand, one of the year's most acclaimed films, Foxcatcher, receives a number of nominations but misses best picture.\nThere are a handful of other notable nominations (or lack thereof) here. While the incredibly charming Lego Movie isn't on the best animated film list, its incredibly addictive title song does get a nod. Disney's animated Marvel superhero film, Big Hero 6, makes it onto the animation list, as does Studio Ghibli's gorgeous Princess Kaguya. Netflix is represented on the list again, too, with Virunga in the documentary category. Laura Poitras' documentary on Snowden, Citizenfour, is also recognized. Finally, you'll notice that while Interstellar shows up in a few different categories, it and Christopher Nolan miss all the big ones.\nThe nominees are as follows. Be sure to catch our coverage of the show, with the biggest wins and craziest moments,  starting tonight at 8:30PM ET :\nBest picture\nThe race for Best Picture is widely considered to be the closest in years. Richard Linklater's Boyhood raked in a number of trophies throughout awards season, but fierce competition from the likes of Birdman as well as the incredible box office performance of American Sniper have kept it from being a clear favorite.\nAmerican Sniper\n","Title":"These are the 2015 Oscar frontrunners | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
