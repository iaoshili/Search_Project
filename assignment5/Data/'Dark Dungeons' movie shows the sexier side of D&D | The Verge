{"Main text":"'Dark Dungeons' movie shows the sexier side of D&D\nFull movie can be purchased for $5\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOnce upon a time, there lived people who were so convinced that Dungeons & Dragons was evil that they came up with  cautionary material like this comic , which illustrates the destructive consequences of the hobby. Years later, filmmakers decided to take the next logical step and create a tongue-in-cheek  Dark Dungeons: The Movie adaptation.\nWho knew that nerds could be so roguishly enticing?\nThe results are hilarious. Debbie and Marcie are two fresh-faced college students who want nothing more than to save souls, but they quickly find themselves confronted by the \"exotic and sinister\" temptations of tabletop role-playing games. Dark Dungeons hits the perfect amount of cheese with its dramatic lines and over-the-top glamorization of the RPG community. Here, gaming enthusiasts are clad in black leather, thigh-high boots, and cocksure smirks that would make David Bowie proud. Who knew that nerds could be so roguishly enticing?\nYou can watch the first eight minutes of this wonderfully silly production for free. The full movie can be purchased from the official Dark Dungeons site and will only set you back $5.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
