{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn the final video straight from the set of Star Wars: Episode VII, director J.J. Abrams gives fans one more thing to look forward to in the new film: a bonafide X-Wing starfighter. The iconic fighter, partially responsible for the destruction of two Death Stars, looks beat-up \u2014  and even somewhat modified \u2014 but formidable. Abrams seemed a little pleased to show it off, only to be a little peeved at the appearance of a mouse droid.\nThat an X-Wing would make an appearance in the film seemed like a foregone conclusion for a bit \u2014 especially after  leaked images from the Abu Dhabi set showed both an under-construction Millennium Falcon and a vehicle that looked like a Z-95 Headhunter, a forerunner of the Incom-designed X-Wing that has appeared in Star Wars video games. While it's unclear who will be flying the craft in the finished film, fans should be excited to see elements of the original trilogy incorporated so deeply in the new series.\n@CDCanimation It is in fact an Episode VII X-wing, not a Z-95.\n\u2014 Star Wars (@starwars) July 21, 2014\n\"We'd love to share the movie with you first.\"\nIn addition, Abrams made clear he wants to end the Force for Change charity campaign on a high note. In addition to giving people the chance to join the cast of the movie, donors will automatically be eligible for a chance to enjoy an advanced screening in their hometown with 20 friends one week before Episode VII hits theaters in December 2015. \"We know how much Star Wars means to so many of you,\" he said, \"and we'd love to share the movie with you first while supporting this truly great cause.\"\nUpdate 2:05PM ET: The official Star Wars Twitter account confirmed this afternoon (after our commenters noticed) that the design for the X-Wing draws from designs by original trilogy artist Ralph McQuarrie. The move makes all the more sense since Abrams seems to be pulling from McQuarrie's art for at least set design .\n\u2014 Star Wars (@starwars) July 21, 2014\nRich McCormick contributed to this report.\n","Title":"This is the new X-Wing fighter from 'Star Wars: Episode VII' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
