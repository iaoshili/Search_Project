{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLenovo is announcing a number of new Yoga and Yoga-like convertibles this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Amongst the flurry of announcements, there\u2019s one that stands out: Lenovo\u2019s 14-inch Yoga 3. At first glance it looks very similar to the Yoga 3 Pro that was announced in October , but dig a little closer and you\u2019ll find a 14-inch screen squeezed into a 13-inch model with the classic Yoga hinge found on previous versions of this popular convertible. While this gives you a little more screen real estate, this 14-inch model doesn\u2019t have the same impressive 3200 x 1800 QHD+ display found on the Yoga 3 Pro.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nInstead, there\u2019s a 1920 x 1080 display with thin bezels that let Lenovo place it into a 13-inch body. You might be losing out on the screen resolution if you opt for this bigger convertible, but you do gain some power for the trade off. Lenovo is using a Intel Core i7 processor in the top 14-inch model, instead of the Core M found on the Yoga 3 Pro. This makes the 14-inch Yoga 3 a little thicker at 18.3mm, compared to the slender 12.7mm body on the Yoga 3 Pro, but you\u2019ll also get the option of discreet Nvidia graphics in the spring to boost performance even further. Lenovo also has a new 11-inch version of the Yoga 3 which is just 2.4 pounds in weight and has a 1920 x 1080 display. Both models will be available in March in the usual black, orange, and silver colors, alongside a new \u201Cchalk white\u201D option. The 11-inch will be priced at $799 and the 14-inch at $979.\nLenovo has also expanded its ThinkPad Yoga line, adding 14- and 15-inch options alongside the current 12-inch model. All three devices come with fifth-generation Intel Core i processors, up to 1TB of storage, and a reworked trackpad that brings back Lenovo\u2019s three-button setup after complaints from users. Lenovo also returned to physical function keys on its ThinkPad after removing it from last year\u2019s models in favor of an unpopular active keyboard that changed the function keys depending on which app was active.\nA Kinect-like camera inside a yoga laptop\nThe 15-inch ThinkPad Yoga is one of the first laptops to offer Intel\u2019s 3D Real Sense camera, which is a Kinect-like depth sensing camera. While there are a few demonstration apps \/ games and the ability to alter the background during video calls, it remains to be seen if developers will build apps that will support Intel\u2019s Real Sense offering. The ThinkPad Yoga 12 starts at $999, while the 14- and 15-inch models begin at $1,199. All three will be available in the coming months.\nAlongside these new Yoga models, Lenovo is bringing its familiar hinge to entry level laptops. Lenovo\u2019s Flex 3 range now sports the 360-degree hinge in 11-, 14-, and 15-inch versions. While you\u2019re not getting the power or build quality found in the Yoga line, these models are a lot more affordable at just $399 for the 11-inch version, $549 and $579 for the 14- and 15-inch models respectively. All three will be available in May.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Lenovo\u2019s new 14-inch Yoga 3 is a bigger convertible in a familiar 13-inch body | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","hands--on","tech","ces-2015"]}
