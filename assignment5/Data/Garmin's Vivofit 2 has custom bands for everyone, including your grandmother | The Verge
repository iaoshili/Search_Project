{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt CES this year Garmin announced the new Vivofit 2 fitness tracker , but while the device itself was a minor upgrade from the original model, the real story was the style aspect. Garmin has partnered with designer Jonathan Adler for his own series of custom bands for the Vivofit 2 (like the original, it's a small pebble-sized device that can snap in and out various bands).\nIn person, Adler's bands are colorful and fun, and they're light enough that they don't feel like they'll be a constant nuisance on your wrist, unlike some clunkier fitness trackers. There's also a clever latching mechanism that is new on the Vivofit 2 bands. Snap the clasp into place and rotate it 90 degrees to lock it into place; even a strong tug won't pull it off.\nWhat Garmin calls the \"Style Collection\" is a slightly different matter. It's supposed to give the device a premium, high-end feel using materials like stainless steel and leather. Aesthetics are certainly a matter of personal taste, but items like the steel or gold-color cuffs not only seemed impractical \u2014 they're rigid bracelets, with one size and one size only \u2014 but they also came off as garish in person. The leather bands and watch-style clasps fared somewhat better, but they were still fingerprint magnets, with only the smallest of interactions leaving a greasy smear behind.\nWith items like the Apple Watch already staking claims on the high end of the spectrum, it's no doubt that flashy, gaudy designs will have their place \u2014 but for my personal tastes, Adler's collection was the more engaging option.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nJonathan Adler's collection of bands.\n","Title":"Garmin's Vivofit 2 has custom bands for everyone, including your grandmother | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
