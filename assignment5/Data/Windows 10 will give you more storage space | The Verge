In a blog post detailing Windows 10\u2019s storage requirements, Microsoft reveals that current preview builds of the new operating system have some rather impressive space-saving techniques. Using file compression, Microsoft has managed to give back around 1.5GB of storage for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB on 64-bit machines. The same savings and compression will also apply to phones running Windows 10 in future.\nNearly 15GB of storage savings on some PCs\nThat\u2019s not the only space saving, though. Windows 10\u2019s refresh and reset options will no longer use a separate recovery image that\u2019s usually preinstalled by PC makers. This frees up anything from 4GB up to 12GB depending on the particular PC make and model, so a total of nearly 15GB of storage savings on some machines. Phones won\u2019t benefit from this change as they have a different recovery solution, but tablets, laptops, and desktops all using Windows 10 will see space increases.\nMicrosoft has long used compression in Windows, but it appears the company has found an improved way to ensure compressing system files doesn\u2019t hinder Windows 10. Microsoft looks at the amount of RAM a system has and how fast its processor can decompress files before it uses compression on system files. \"If compressed system files will give you storage capacity back without compromising your device\u2019s responsiveness, then upgrade will automatically compress Windows 10,\" notes a Microsoft spokesperson. Existing devices will benefit from the Windows 10 upgrade, alongside new machines that ship when the operating system is available later this year.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with Windows 10\n","Title":"Windows 10 will give you more storage space | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech"]}
