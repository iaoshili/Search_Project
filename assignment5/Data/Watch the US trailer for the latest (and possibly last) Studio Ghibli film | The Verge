On May 22nd, When Marnie Was There will open in Los Angeles and New York before expanding elsewhere, and you can see the first US trailer above. It's the second feature helmed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who previously directed The Secret World of Arrietty. The English dub stars Hailee Steinfeld (True Grit) and Kiernan Shipka (Mad Men).\n\"We\u2019ve got to think about what we\u2019ll do next.\"\nWhen Marnie Was There came out in Japan last summer , and  Studio Ghibli is yet to confirm whether it'll make another feature-length movie at all. \"We\u2019re changing the way we make (animation),\" said long-time producer Toshio Suzuki soon after the film's Japanese release. \"We wanted to make a dream company. We thought we would make what suited us and not make what didn\u2019t suit us. We were able to realize (that dream) to some extent and we\u2019re very happy about that. But now we\u2019re at a point where we\u2019ve got to think about what we\u2019ll do next.\"\nStudio Ghibli's most recent film to see release in the US was Isao Takahata's dazzling The Tale of the Princess Kaguya , which got an Academy nomination for Best Animated Feature.\n","Title":"Watch the US trailer for the latest (and possibly last) Studio Ghibli film | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
