{"Main text":"Apple employees will get a 50 percent discount on the Apple Watch\nOver 1,000 Apple Watch apps were submitted to the App Store last week\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple employees are getting a substantial discount on the new Apple Watch according to a memo sent around the company and obtained by  9to5Mac . After noting that over 1,000 Watch apps were submitted to the App Store just last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote that every employee will be able to purchase the stainless steel Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport with a 50 percent discount beginning on April 10th. Unsurprisingly, the Apple Watch Edition \u2014 which begins at $10,000 \u2014 is not up for a discount. While Apple didn't give its employees a discount when it released the iPad, it did offer a price cut for most of its workers when it released the iPhone in 2007. Apple employees will be able to utilize their discount for 90 days after the Apple Watch becomes available on April 24th.\nVerge Video: It's finally here- Reviewing the Apple Watch\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
