{"Main text":"Why it won't be long until we ride in driverless cars\nWhere we're going, we don't need drivers\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOur future will include driverless cars.\nAt this year's CES, car companies and graphics card manufacturers alike featured the technology that they believe will power the vehicles of tomorrow. I remember each morning of CES as I sipped coffee on the stoop of The Verge's trailer, watching Volkswagen demonstrate its new driverless parking functionality. The demonstration looked silly, but felt like looking at the not-so-distant future \u2014 sort of like how the ASIMO demonstration at Disneyland feels both gimmicky and like a prescient warning of our robot overlords.\nHow soon will we be driving hands-free? Is the country even ready for driverless vehicles? Those questions have stuck with me since the trade show. For this week, I invited The Verge's car expert Chris Ziegler to explain the history of the driverless car and the incremental improvements that have led us to this moment. Strap on your seat belts! It's going to be a very smooth and safe automated ride.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
