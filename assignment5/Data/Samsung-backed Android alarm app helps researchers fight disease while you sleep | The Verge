A new app called Power Sleep uses your phone's downtime to crunch protein calculations. That data's used to research cures for diseases, similar to Folding@Home , which was popularized by the PlayStation 3. In this case, Power Sleep  \u2014 which was backed by Samsung, and made by its former in-house marketing agency Cheil \u2014 doubles as an alarm clock designed to replace whatever alarm people were using before. Once set, the app begins grabbing packets of data to crunch, which are about 1MB in size, then sending them back when the process is complete.\nCrunches data while you and your phone are sleeping\nThis isn't the first app to target unused computing cycles for scientific research. Last year UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory released BOINC , an app named after its Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing project that effectively does the same thing, minus the alarm clock feature. BOINC also lets people pick other distributed projects like identifying asteroids and monitoring earthquake activity. Power Sleep is actually based on BOINC, Cheil says, but focuses specifically on protein calculations.\nPower Sleep is only for Android devices running 2.3 and above, and can be found on Samsung's App Store and Google Play. And for the curious, its creators say the only thing that's being collected are protein calculations, and not any personal data.\n","Title":"Samsung-backed Android alarm app helps researchers fight disease while you sleep | The Verge","Tags":["apps","science"]}
