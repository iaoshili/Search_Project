{"Main text":"Congress quietly removes annual reporting requirement for paid travel\n...but a website will still show all lawmakers' paid trips\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCongress has been criticized for many things in recent months \u2014 fumbling on  immigration reform , failing to  pass basic bills for state services, leaving the long-term unemployed without help \u2014 you name it. Now you can add obscuring details of who's paying for lawmakers' travel to the list. As first observed by National Journal , the House Ethics Committee \u2014 which is in charge of establishing the rules by which Congress operates \u2014 quietly removed a requirement to list \"sponsored travel\" on their annual financial disclosure forms. Sponsored travel refers to those trips lawmakers take that are paid for by groups outside Congress, often agenda-based or lobbying organizations. The trips have a tendency to be lavish and extend to lawmakers' family and loved ones, and came under fire in the 1970s after Watergate and in 2006, after the Jack Abramoff scandal.\nWhile the move has some Congressional watchdog groups alarmed,  The Huffington Post points out that Congress will still be reporting these trips as they occur on  the Clerk of the House's website . While that still doesn't provide quite as good an overview as the annual disclosure forms, it does mean that the internet will be the best way to keep track of who is wining and dining your lawmaker, and when.\nUpdate: Congress may be backing down from the move. On Thursday, Congressman Mike Conaway, Chair of the House Ethics Committee told  National Journal his committee would reverse the decision.\n","Title":"Congress quietly removes annual reporting requirement for paid travel | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
