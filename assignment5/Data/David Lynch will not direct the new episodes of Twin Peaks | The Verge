{"Main text":"David Lynch will not direct the new episodes of Twin Peaks\nSeries creator says Showtime didn't offer enough money\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJust three months after David Lynch made thousands of dreams come true by announcing his seminal Twin Peaks was coming back to TV , the director has brought fans crashing back to reality by announcing on Twitter tonight that he would now not be directing the new episodes of the show. Lynch said that he was walking away from the planned miniseries, having pulled out of the deal because Showtime, the network bankrolling the new episodes of the mysterious drama, did not offer enough money to do justice to his script.\nAfter 1 year and 4 months of negotiations, I left because not enough money was offered to do the script the way I felt it needed to be done.\n\u2014 David Lynch (@DAVID_LYNCH) April 5, 2015\nIt was  rumored earlier today that Showtime had canceled the planned miniseries altogether, but Lynch clarified the situation, saying that the network did not \" pull the plug \" on the show, and that it may still continue without him. The reboot, in which Kyle MacLachlan was going to  come back as the inimitable Special Agent Dale Cooper , was rumored to return on June 10th, 2016 \u2014 the same day Laura Palmer told Cooper she'd see him at the end of the final season in 1991.\nThis weekend I started to call actors to let them know I would not be directing. Twin Peaks may still be very much alive at Showtime.\n\u2014 David Lynch (@DAVID_LYNCH) April 5, 2015\nIn a statement provided to The Verge, Showtime said it was saddened to hear of Lynch's decision to walk away from the show.\nWe were saddened to read David Lynch's statement today since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points. SHOWTIME also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm.\nLynch may eventually return to direct should the network offer more money or the deal get reworked, but it would certainly be hard to imagine a return to the weird and wonderful Twin Peaks without its creator at the helm.\nUpdate April 5th, 8:30PM ET: Updated with statement from Showtime.\n","Title":"David Lynch will not direct the new episodes of Twin Peaks | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
