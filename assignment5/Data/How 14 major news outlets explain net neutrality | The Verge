{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday's FCC decision to protect the internet with Title II regulation is a big win for the internet and net neutrality advocates \u2014 and the start of a big fight for both sides of the issue .

Those prohibitions are hallmarks of the net neutrality concept.\nUSA Today: FCC approves new net neutrality rules\nNet neutrality, also called open Internet, is a principle that Internet networks are equally available to all types of legal content generators. Internet service providers (ISPs), mostly large cable or telephone companies, would be prohibited from discriminating against content by slowing transmission speeds or seeking payments in exchange for faster lanes of their Internet networks, a practice called \"paid prioritization.\"\n","Title":"How 14 major news outlets explain net neutrality | The Verge","Tags":["policy","tldr","us-world","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7742856"]}
