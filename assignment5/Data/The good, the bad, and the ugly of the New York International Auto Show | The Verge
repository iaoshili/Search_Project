{"Main text":"The good, the bad, and the ugly of the New York International Auto Show\nLet's walk the floor together\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI just spent the last two days hanging out at Manhattan's Javits Center, checking out the best (and worst) of the  New York International Auto Show . It's not the most insane display of automotive pageantry in the world \u2014 there are other shows both domestically and internationally that involve more fanfare \u2014 but there were still plenty of amazing things to see.  McLaren launched a new supercar ,  Porsche launched its most extreme Boxster , and  Land Rover showed off a $200,000 Range Rover , just to name a few.\nIn the waning moments of day two, I strolled the floor with our video crew along for the ride. Have a look \u2014 there's some neat stuff in here.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
