Last summer, San Francisco-based company Airware  announced its intentions to build a platform to help make it easier for companies to deploy drones, and today the company is formally launching its Aerial Information Platform \u2014 a standardized drone operating system that could make it far simpler for companies to deploy and manage fleets of drones.\n\"For drones to be used in a growing number of applications across a number of industries, there needs to be a platform,\" Airware CEO and founder Jonathan Downey said at a press briefing held in the middle of a farm in northern California \u2014 a space ideal for doing some drone tests. \"The idea [behind Airware] was that we would support a wide variety of vehicles required to address the myriad of different applications for which drones will be a key part of the solution.\" Downey\u2019s vision is that any drone running the Airware platform can be configured, deployed, and run the same way as any other \u2014 even if the vehicle itself is a completely different drone build by a different company for another purpose.\nAirware believes a standard platform is needed for drones to really work for businesses\nTo make that happen, Airware spent the last four years building what it calls the Aerial Information Platform \u2014 a system that encompasses both software and hardware that standardizes the drone experience for a company. The first piece of that puzzle is the \"flight core\" \u2014 a hardware autopilot box that can be attached to a drone that runs Airware\u2019s flight software.\nThe flight core then communicates from the drone with operators on the ground running Airware\u2019s two different software solutions. The Ground Control Station program lets you build your flight plan, set geofences and contingency plans for the drone, and basically tweak anything related to the in-flight mission the drone will carry out. The farm provided a perfect venue for showing off the software \u2014 Airware\u2019s CTO Buddy Michini set up a geofence over the farm, dictated how high and fast the drone would fly, built a flight plan for surveying the area and shooting photos every second, and then launched a test drone to carry out his instructions.\nThere\u2019s also a higher-level configuration manager that lets administrators build out bigger projects with specific goals \u2014 that can all be then sent down to the Ground Control program where the actual operators will carry out their jobs. While there\u2019s no doubt that the demonstration Airware showed off made things look as simple as possible, it did feel highly approachable, with a relatively simple learning curve. That\u2019s by design \u2014 Airware said it looked at the UIs for various drone programs and found most were designed for pilots or engineers, whereas the Airware system is designed to be easily approachable by the employees it expects to carry out these tasks.\nAs for the kinds of companies that might deploy such a system, Airware had two partners on hand \u2014 GE (who is also an investor in the company) and telecommunications company Infinigy. When talking about Infinigy, Downey noted that 13 people died in 2013 while carrying out cell phone tower inspections \u2014 so Infinigy hopes to use drones to replace people when doing basic checks on towers, saving humans for only situations in which repair or other actual physical work is needed.\nGE didn\u2019t talk specifics about how it might use drones, Downey said that the company was working with utility companies to utilize drones to check power lines and equipment against vegetation encroachment. And manufacturer Drone America is already building drones that can deliver lifeboats in emergencies as well as carry out search-and-rescue missions.\nCan Airware become for drones what Android is for smartphones?\nWhile Airware is only rolling out the flight core and its two software platforms today, the company has more planned. The \"app core\" will let third parties write plug-ins for the Ground Control software that could expand a drone\u2019s capabilities when it launches in the coming months, and Airware is also launching a cloud-based platform for managing a company\u2019s drone fleet in ways that extend beyond simple missions \u2014 it\u2019ll help companies (and its end users) deal with the insurance and government compliance requirements needed for managing a drone fleet. The cloud platform will also make it easy to analyze the various sensor data gathered by a drone flight and share it within an organization.\nIt\u2019s the early days for Airware, and the company is a rather unique entity in the drone space, so it isn\u2019t trying to rush its new drone operating system out there \u2014 the company is working with a handful of manufacturers now, and says that it is currently targeting the \"top 50\" commercial drone manufacturers for potential partnerships. It remains to be seen if those drone manufacturers \u2014 as well as the companies who need the drones for their work \u2014 will find Airware\u2019s platform to be worth the cost ($2,500 per drone, per year).\nBut in a new market with no real status quo, Airware is betting that it can become the universal drone OS across all hardware makers. That\u2019s easier said than done though \u2014 some analysts are already imagining a world in which hardware quickly becomes commoditized, with software being the differentiator. \"Next year and the year after that, you\u2019re going to see hundreds of DJI clones,\" Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz (an investor in Airware),  told The Wall Street Journal yesterday . \"I don\u2019t think long term that\u2019s a good bet...Software is going to eat drones.\" For the moment, at least, Airware\u2019s got the head start in the race to find what could become for drones what Android is for smartphones.\n","Title":"Airware's custom drone operating system launches today | The Verge","Tags":["business","tech"]}
