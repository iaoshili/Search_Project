{"Main text":"These questions will determine whether the jury finds Kleiner Perkins liable\nMoving closer to a verdict in the Ellen Pao case\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJudge Harold Kahn just finished giving the jury inÂ  the Ellen Pao v. Kleiner Perkins case the verdict form they will use as a guide to determine whether the venture capital firm is liable for gender discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent retaliation for not promoting her to senior partner and terminating her employment after she complained about discrimination.\nPao, now the interim CEO of Reddit, is suing for $16 million in compensatory damages for income she lost by not being promoted and later fired. The jury has been instructed not to take into account Pao's stock options at Reddit or the loss of \"carried interest,\" which refers to profits she may have shared as a general parter on one of Kleiner's investment funds.\nClosing arguments will begin in less than 10 minutes. Judge Kahn took nearly 45 minutes to instruct the jury, which has a rough task ahead of it.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post stated that Kleiner Perkins could be found guilty instead of liable.
