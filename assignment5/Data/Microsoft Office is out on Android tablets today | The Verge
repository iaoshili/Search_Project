{"Main text":"Microsoft Office is out on Android tablets today\nOffice for iOS hits 80 million downloads\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft's Android tablet versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint are no longer in  preview mode ; you'll be able to download them today. As with the iOS apps launched last year,  Office is essentially free to use on Android for most consumers, though certain premium features and business functionality require an Office 365 subscription. The preview program covered more than 3,000 variants of 500 separate Android devices, and native support for Intel processors is coming later in the year.\nMicrosoft says the iPhone and iPad versions of Office have been downloaded more than 80 million times worldwide. Although the free release on competing platforms represents a major change in strategy, it's all part of CEO Satya Nadella's plan to put the company's services on the most popular devices \u2014 whether they run a Microsoft OS or not. Office 2016 is coming for Windows later this year, however, and a new touch-friendly version will be included with Windows 10 for phones and small tablets .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
