{"Main text":"By Bryan Bishop and Casey Newton\nStrip away the spectacle and the snow, and Sundance is all about one thing: movies. For its 30th anniversary year, the film festival debuted an incredibly diverse selection of titles, ranging from the funny to the violent to the just outright odd. Below we\u2019ve collected some of the films we liked the most so you know exactly what to look out for in the year ahead.\nTHE VERGE FAVORITES\nBoyhood\nRichard Linklater\u2019s film covers the evolution of a family by catching up with them at annual intervals over the course of 12 years . It could have come off as a gimmick, but fantastic performances and brazenly honest writing result in a movie full of realistic moments and small insights about our lives. Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette are remarkable as two divorced parents, but it\u2019s the work of Ellar Coltrane \u2014 who grows from a six-year-old to a high-school grad before our eyes \u2014 that will really stick with you. -BB\nDear White People\nJustin Simien\u2019s first feature film will knock you out: it\u2019s a deliciously layered portrait of love and identity politics on a fictional Ivy League campus. Simien, who wrote and directed, rips an all-too-common occurrence from the headlines \u2014 a house party where the theme is racist black stereotypes \u2014 and considers the motivations of the people who throw it. (Not all of them are white.) Four complex protagonists play off one another in beautifully realized scenes where everyone has something smart to say. Dear White People is written like Sorkin, composed like Wes Anderson, and funny in a style that is all Simien\u2019s own. See. This. Movie. -CN\nThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy\nAs an inventor, a coder, and an activist, Aaron Swartz made an outsized impact on the world before he died at the age of 26. In a compelling new feature-length documentary , Brian Knappenberger (We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists) examines Swartz\u2019s diverse contributions to the modern internet, which include key roles in the development of RSS, the Creative Commons, and Reddit. Swartz\u2019s activism leads him to copy millions of documents from a digital library, resulting in a prosecution that the film argues drove him to suicide. While it occasionally veers toward agitprop, The Internet\u2019s Own Boy is an honest and infuriating account of a tragedy that still feels entirely preventable. -CN\nLife After Beth\nThe myth of Orpheus and Eurydice keeps coming back from the dead, so why not turn it into a zombie comedy? Jeff Baena\u2019s Life After Beth stars Dane DeHaan as a lover who can\u2019t let go and Aubrey Plaza as Beth, the girlfriend from hell. The plot is somewhat rickety, and it never becomes as funny as you hope it will, but amid all the shouting and carnage the film does have a beating heart. (Beth eats it.) -CN\nLife Itself\nHow did a chubby know-it-all from Urbana, Illinois come through decades of alcoholism and loneliness to redefine film criticism? Hoop Dreams director Steve James chronicles the improbable life of Roger Ebert with sophistication and wit, charting his evolution from small-town newspaperman to great American writer. The heart of the film lies in its portrait of the critic\u2019s unlikely partnerships: with his wife, Chaz, whose love he describes as \u201Ca wind forcing me back from the grave,\u201D and with Gene Siskel, his one-time nemesis who evolves over the decades to become a great friend. -CN\nThe Raid 2\nI go into further detail in our full review , but suffice to say that Gareth Evans\u2019 sequel ups the ante on mayhem while also delivering a full-bodied gangster drama with echoes of The Godfather. The result? One of the most spellbinding action film in years. Don\u2019t worry if you didn\u2019t like The Raid: Redemption; you\u2019ll like this one. -BB\nThe Signal\nWriter-director Will Eubank largely flew under the radar with his debut Love, but he\u2019s returning to sci-fi with the thriller The Signal. Brenton Thwaites and Beau Knapp play two MIT students who track down the location of a notorious hacker in the desert. But after being mysteriously attacked they find themselves quarantined for exposure to extraterrestrials \u2014 and the mind games start from there. Laurence Fishburne lends the necessary gravitas as the scientist overseeing the quarantine, and while the film does meander down a narrative dead-end or two, genre fans will no doubt appreciate Eubank\u2019s clever take on some familiar themes. -BB\nWish I Was Here\nZach Braff\u2019s latest feature may have drawn ire from those that felt he was taking advantage of Kickstarter , but everyone that contributed will be thrilled with the end result. Braff stars as a husband and father of two who\u2019s trying to find his way in life while also dealing with his emotionally whacked-out brother (a hilarious Josh Gad) and dying father (Mandy Patinkin). It sounds like it could be a self-indulgent groanfest, but Braff\u2019s movie is funny, quirky, and will probably move you to tears before the credits roll. -BB\nThe Chatter\nWith a festival as big as Sundance, it\u2019s nearly impossible to see every movie \u2014 and that\u2019s when actual human interaction becomes so important. Whether you\u2019re in line, on the bus, or packed inside a cramped bar, odds are the person next to you has seen something amazing. Here\u2019s what we heard getting talked up the most.\nCamp X-Ray\nAudiences have been enthusiastic about Kristen Stewart\u2019s performance as a young woman who escapes her small town by enlisting in the military, which stations her at Guantanamo Bay. Her unlikely friendship with a detainee forms the heart of the film.\nFrank\nMichael Fassbender wears a giant fake head in this movie. That may be all you needed to hear, but word on the streets of Park City was that this comedy was quite good as well. A quirky film about art and the nature of creativity, it also features Maggie Gyllenhaal as a theremin player (which once you think about it, makes perfect sense).\nMitt\nNetflix made a festival appearance with this documentary about 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Focusing on the man rather than the politics, director Greg Whiteley\u2019s work drew approval from both sides of the aisle \u2014 and in true Netflix style, it\u2019s already available for streaming.\nWhiplash\nDamien Chazelle\u2019s portrait of a promising young drummer and his merciless teacher was one of the festival\u2019s most talked-about films even before it won the US Grand Jury Prize for drama. J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller are drawing acclaim as teacher and student.\n","Title":"What to watch: our favorite movies of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival | The Verge","Tags":["culture","movie-reviews","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5099501"]}
