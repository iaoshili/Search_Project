Lockheed Martin, the company that makes the fighter jets, was set to deliver them in the midst of the recent ISIS violence. Last December, The New York Times reported that the US was \"quietly\" rushing \"dozens\" of surveillance drones and Hellfire missiles (which can be shot from manned and unmanned aircraft) to Iraq to help fight back against insurgent violence. But so far these weapons have done little to stop the ISIS advance.\nThe challenge facing the US now, as ISIS conquers some of Iraq\u2019s largest and most economically productive cities, is to help the Iraqi government push back the insurgency without returning a heavy US military presence to Iraq. \"The strategic question is: \u2018What tools do you have to shape the politics of Iraq?\u2019\" says Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East division at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan think-tank.\nUSS George H.W. Bush aircraft carrier at sea ( U.S. Marine Corps  \/  Brian Brooks )\nObama\u2019s options\n1. Military intervention\nPresident Obama has strongly and repeatedly committed not to send US soldiers back into combat in Iraq. \"I think we always have to guard against mission creep, so let me repeat what I\u2019ve said in the past: American combat troops are not going to be fighting in Iraq again,\" Obama said on Thursday.\nNevertheless, the US has been re-escalating its military presence in the region. On June 16th, Obama ordered 275 American troops to Iraq to help guard the American embassy in Baghdad, and later announced that \"up to 300\" military advisors would also be sent to \"assess how we can best train, advise, and support Iraqi security forces going forward.\"\n\"we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action.\"\nThe US has also sent an aircraft carrier into the Persian Gulf with four squadrons of F\/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, as well as other jamming planes and helicopters, according to The Guardian . Alongside the carrier are two warships, the USS Truxtun and the USS Philippine Sea, both of which have an armament of Tomahawk missiles that could be launched at targets on the ground in Iraq, according to the Associated Press . The USS Mesa Verde , another transport ship sent to the Persian Gulf on June 16th, carries 550 Marines, two landing hovercraft, and five MV22-Osprey aircraft capable of vertical takeoffs and landings for transporting troops.\nSurveillance drones and manned Navy P3 aircraft have been reported flying over Iraq to gather intelligence. The US has been tracking insurgent movements with unmanned surveillance drones over Iraq since last year, as the  Wall Street Journal recently reported, and Obama stressed the importance of intelligence sharing in his speech Thursday.\n\"The ability of the Iraqi government to see and track what\u2019s going on is pretty limited,\" says Eric Thompson, director of strategic studies at CNA, a nonprofit analytic organization in Virginia. \"And that's a capacity that the US has on a scale that\u2019s second to none.\"\nObama is also considering armed drone strikes against ISIS, possibly even in Syria , where ISIS is also based. \"Going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action,\" the president said Thursday. The Iraqi government has requested air support, but so far the administration has said only that all options are on the table. The problem with air strikes, however, is that ISIS militants have now embedded themselves among civilians, raising the risk of civilian casualties. Further, the Obama administration has been criticized around the world for its use of armed drone strikes and the over 2,000 estimated casualties , many of them civilians.\nGiven Obama\u2019s previous limited responses to the conflicts in Ukraine, Libya and Syria (only Libya saw American air strikes in 2011) it\u2019s unlikely that the president would turn to any of these options lightly, if at all. \"The administration\u2019s bias is toward caution,\" Alterman says. \"Its general approach has been to wind down wars, not escalate them.\"\nPrior to the run of ISIS conquests in Iraq, Obama outlined his administration\u2019s doctrine for dealing with foreign conflicts in a speech in May , saying: \"U.S. military action cannot be the only \u2014 or even primary \u2014 component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.\" If the US is able to help the Iraqi government drive back without resorting to using military force of its own, that could prove the value of Obama\u2019s cautionary approach. It could also provide a template for dealing with future conflicts overseas.\nPhoto of an MQ-9 Reaper drone over Iraq in 2008. ( U.S. Air Force  \/ Richard Lisum )\n2. The Iran factor\nThe success of ISIS in Iraq has even raised the prospect of cooperation between longtime adversaries Iran and the US. Iran\u2019s Shia government supports Maliki, and neither the US nor Iran wants a large American military presence back in the region. Iran has sent special forces across the border in support of the Iraqi army, and Iranian officials reportedly discussed the possibility of cooperation with their American counterparts during this month\u2019s nuclear talks in Vienna.\nUS officials have been reluctant to discuss details of a possible collaboration with Iran, and the prospect has drawn mixed reactions from Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. Relations between the two countries have remained frigid for decades, and distrust remains high in spite of the progress made in recent talks over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The two are on opposing sides of the Syrian civil war, with Iran supporting the Assad regime and the US backing some of the rebel groups looking to overthrow it, and working together could alienate Saudi Arabia and other US allies in the region.\n\"We are strongly opposed to US and other intervention in Iraq.\"\nSigns of discord have emerged since the possibility of cooperation was raised in early June. \"We are strongly opposed to US and other intervention in Iraq,\" Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Sunday. \"We don\u2019t approve of it as we believe the Iraqi government, nation, and religious authorities are capable of ending the sedition.\" He later accused the US of seeking regime change in Iraq for its own benefit: \"The US is seeking an Iraq under its hegemony and ruled by its stooges.\"\nThe White House is also wary of Iranian involvement, fearing that intervention may only fan the flames of sectarianism, and the Pentagon last week said that military cooperation is off the table . \"If Iran is coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the Shia, and if it is framed in that fashion, then that probably worsens the situation,\" Obama said Thursday, \"and the prospect for government formation that would actually be constructive over the long term.\"\n3. Form a stable Iraqi government\nLong-term stability in Iraq is going to require political reform. Since taking office, Maliki has been criticized for implementing anti-Sunni policies and limiting high-level positions to those from his own Shiite sect. The US has long pushed Maliki to create a more inclusive government, and his failure to do so, experts say, helped fuel this month\u2019s violence by making it easier for ISIS to garner support among disillusioned Sunnis. \"There\u2019s a sense that if Maliki lets the Sunnis in [to greater roles in government], all this goes away,\" Alterman says of ISIS. Any lasting solution for quelling violence, therefore, will necessarily require some concessions from Maliki.\nEarlier this month,  Obama indicated that any American intervention would be contingent upon political reform from Maliki. \"Any action that we may take to provide assistance to Iraqi security forces has to be joined by a serious and sincere effort by Iraq's leaders to set aside sectarian differences.\"  The Wall Street Journal reported that the Obama administration wants Iraq to form a new government without Maliki \u2014 one that would include Kurds and Sunnis, and, theoretically, curb support for ISIS. Maliki himself is clearly aware he\u2019s in as much of a political fight as a military one: on June 17th, he gave a televised address calling for Sunni critics to unite with his Shiia-led government against ISIS. Yesterday, Kerry  announced that Maliki and other Iraqi leaders have pledged to form a new government by July 1st, as mandated under the country's constitution. Maliki's coalition  won a majority of parliamentary seats in elections held on April 30th, though actually forming a government  has proved arduous in the past.\n\"The United States is in a no-win situation at this point.\"\nYet some experts are skeptical that a more inclusive government would solve the immediate problem: pushing back ISIS. \"It seems to me that people are rushing the political piece of this, the desire to create a more inclusive and more democratic government in Iraq as a way out of this crisis,\" Alterman says. \"I\u2019m not confident that\u2019s what has to happen right now.\" Instead, he thinks the Iraqi government\u2019s best course of action is to pressure other sectarian leaders in Iraq with a combination of \"carrots and sticks,\" e.g. financial rewards for supporting the government against ISIS and penalties for not doing so.\nOthers see risks in supporting Maliki. Although the prospect of a radical Islamic state poses obvious concerns for the US, engaging in a sectarian conflict may only bolster support for Sunni insurgents.\n\"The problem is that by providing support to Maliki in a situation where the population is very divided is going to be interpreted in Iraq as us support for war against Sunnis,\" says Marina Ottaway, a senior scholar at the Wilson Center and an expert on Middle East politics. \"The United States is in a no-win situation at this point.\"\n","Title":"There may be nothing America can do to save Iraq | The Verge","Tags":["policy","report","us-world"]}
