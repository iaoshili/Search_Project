{"Main text":"Will.i.am's Puls smartwatch is the worst product I've touched all year\nI gotta feeling no one should buy this thing\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMusician, producer, and just generally positive dude will.i.am has dipped his toes  more than once into the personal technology world. His latest venture is a wearable smartphone called the Puls, sold under his i.am+ company. The Puls is a fully independent smartwatch \u2014 it has its own SIM card and doesn't rely on being connected to a smartphone to work. Will.i.am  introduced it to the world on a stage at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference last month in front a bunch of devotees to CRM.\nI got a chance to use an early production model earlier today. It's objectively the worst product I've touched all year.\nThe Puls is a stiff cuff that you wear around your wrist. It has a curved touchscreen on its surface and sensors to measure your activity. Instead of Android Wear (or a full version of Android), the Puls runs its own operating system that relies on swipe gestures to navigate. It's a thick and inflexible device that is not comfortable to wear. In fact, the unit I used didn't even close around my wrist and needed another spacer to do so.\nThe Puls feels like a Kickstarter project that never should have made it to production\nThe screen is small and grainy and the operating system is neither responsive or intuitive. There are a few preinstalled apps for Twitter, Instagram, contacts, and more, and the Puls has a full dialer for making phone calls. It also has a full QWERTY keyboard, which requires two presses to type a single letter (one to zoom in, a second to actually input the letter). It's unsurprisingly terribly frustrating to use. The Puls' feels like a Kickstarter concept product that never should have made it to production.\n","Title":"Will.i.am's Puls smartwatch is the worst product I've touched all year | The Verge","Tags":["hands--on","tech"]}
