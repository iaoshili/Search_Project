{"Main text":"You can now watch every Marvel movie scene in chronological order, starting in 2987 BC\nSome assembly required\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMarvel Studios has made it a selling point that every frame it produces lives in the same continuous universe. So what if you wanted to watch it in order? Not based on release dates but the narrative itself \u2014 from a 2987 BC flashback in Thor: The Dark World through the Battle of New York in The Avengers?\nFurth split the films up to make sure flashbacks fit in the right order as well\nThat's just what Mike Furth from The Comic Archive attempted to do with all 10 Marvel Studios films \u2014 The Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and all their sequels \u2014 plus selected clips from Agents of SHIELD, Agent Carter, and a few of the \"Marvel one shot\" short films (with help, he acknowledges, from  Andrew Norfolk's timeline ). And it's not just a matter of re-ordering the full films \u2014 Furth split the films up to make sure flashbacks fit in the right order as well. This Phase One omnibus starts at the beginning of time up until the events of The Avengers \u2014 with flashbacks from Iron Man 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy where chronologically important.\nFor the superfan (in Marvel parlance, the \"true believer\"), you can watch and listen to Furth's 27-minute video explaining his process. Regardless, we commend him for the daunting task and wish him the best should he try to attempt this on an annual basis, given Marvel Studios will be putting out  multiple films every year until we are all but dust in the wind.\nFun fact: Furth's Marvel cut runs over 12 hours, but that's honestly not too far over the Lord of the Rings: Extended Edition runtime.\nVerge Video Archives: How Marvel Assembled its Movie Universe\n","Title":"You can now watch every Marvel movie scene in chronological order, starting in 2987 BC | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
