{"Main text":"Roku finally secures HBO Go and Showtime for Comcast subscribers\nThe deal's done but the start date is still unknown\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRoku is the latest streaming service playing fill-in-the-blanks with its video content. An FCC filing reveals that the company has finally secured a deal with Comcast to allow subscribers of the world\u2019s largest cable company access to HBO Go and Showtime on Roku\u2019s devices.\nThe document was  spotted by Recode and states that while Comcast has condescended to \"authenticate\" these two apps in a deal on November 25th, there\u2019s no explicit start date for when the content will be up and running.\nRoku has made a deal with Comcast \u2014 but Amazon still hasn't\nAnd while Roku has managed to convince Comcast (or just capitulated to its terms), rival firms have been less successful. Amazon announced this week that it too had secured access to HBO Go for its Fire TV device before adding that  Comcast and Charter subscribers would still be locked out .\nAlthough these legacy providers are apparently indifferent to the pain they\u2019re causing customers, the current glut of streaming devices on the market means that by 2015 more and more people will be demanding easy access to shows they already pay for. Hopefully, Comcast can't pretend to be deaf to this demand for much longer.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
