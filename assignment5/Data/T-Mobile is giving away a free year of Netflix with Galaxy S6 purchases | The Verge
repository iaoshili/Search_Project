{"Main text":"T-Mobile is giving away a free year of Netflix with Galaxy S6 purchases\nPre-orders are likely to kick off on March 27th\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nT-Mobile CEO John Legere has revealed that the carrier will throw in a free year of Netflix for all customers who purchase Samsung's Galaxy S6 or S6 Edge. The offer will run from March 27th \u2014 when T-Mobile is likely to open up pre-orders \u2014 through April 9th. The fine print at the company's S6 website says you'll need to put in for your complimentary 12-month subscription code by May 21st and redeem it with Netflix by June 20th. T-Mobile will cover a year of Netflix'sÂ two-stream plan, which normally runs $8.99 per month, for a total value of over $100.\nBeyond that, we don't yet know any other catches or potential gotchas that might drag down the appeal of T-Mobile's promotion; hopefully it'll be open to existing Netflix subscribers, at the very least. Beyond stating the offer will only be valid \"while codes last,\" T-Mobile has said it will share more specifics on the deal soon. Just keep in mind that while popular music services don't count against your data plan on T-Mobile, Netflix and other video apps most certainly do \u2014 for now. Samsung has said the Galaxy S6 will begin its launch on April 10th, though US carriers haven't yet firmed up their own release dates.\n","Title":"T-Mobile is giving away a free year of Netflix with Galaxy S6 purchases | The Verge","Tags":["google","hd-home","mobile","tech"]}
