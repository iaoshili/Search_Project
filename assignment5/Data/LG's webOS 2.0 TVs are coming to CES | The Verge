{"Main text":"LG's webOS 2.0 TVs are coming to CES\nNew features, faster performance\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLG's attempt to resurrect webOS for smart TVs is entering a new phase at CES 2015. A wide range of webOS 2.0 TVs will be displayed in Vegas, and LG is focusing on performance; the company says that starting the YouTube app from the home screen is 70 percent faster, for example, and overall boot times should be up to 60 percent quicker.\nBean Bird is back\nNew OS features include a \"My Channels\" option that lets you access favorite channels from the launcher bar, along with a redesigned input picker and a quick settings mode that doesn't interrupt the current TV show. LG is also working with the likes of Netflix and Amazon to secure options for 4K streaming content. And it looks like Bean Bird is back with a vengeance.\nLG says that over 5 million webOS TVs were sold in the first eight months after release. The company isn't telling whether its accidentally revealed webOS smartwatch will be on show at CES, but either way The Verge will be on hand to see the full webOS lineup for ourselves.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
