The upcoming action movie features Tom Hardy as road warrior Max Rockatansky, and a shaven-headed Charlize Theron as \"bad-ass commander\" Imperator Furiosa.\n\"I wanted to tell a linear story \u2014 a chase that starts as the movie begins and continues for 110 minutes,\"  says 69-year-old George Miller, who directed all of the original Mad Max movies. The cast reportedly spent seven months in the Namibia desert in order to shoot the dystopian-themed film, which Miller first envisioned in 2000. On top of an interview with the director,  Entertainment Weekly also published some storyboard art and a number of stills from the 2015 reboot. The images show combat scenes, post-apocalyptic vehicles, and the cast looking dirty, stern-faced, and battle-worn.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
