A Google spokesperson told The Verge today that \"while some inventory of Nexus 5 still exists (with our retail and carrier partners), our focus is on the Nexus 6 at this time.\" Searches for the older model on Google's new hardware store show that the Nexus 5 is no longer available for purchase direct from Google.\nThe Nexus 5 is no longer available to buy on the Google Store\nThe news corroborates  a report released at the tail end of 2014 that said Google had discontinued production of the  well-liked phone , and once stocks were depleted, it was \"gone.\" Google disputed the claim at the time,  telling The Verge that the Nexus 5 would \"continue to be available for sale on Google Play and through select retailers in Q1 2015.\" The timing of this new statement means both were correct \u2014 Google did indeed plan to stop selling the Nexus 5, but its supplies kept it in stock for the first quarter of 2015.\nThe effective retirement of the Nexus 5 comes as Google  tweaks its storefront to separate hardware and digital products. Previously the Nexus 5 \u2014 along with other Google and Android devices such as smartwatches and Chromebooks \u2014 was sold by the Google Play Store, alongside digital products like apps, music, and movies. As of today, the search giant has split software and hardware up, moving the latter to a new destination simply called the Google Store.\nVerge Video: The paradox of the Chromebook Pixel\n","Title":"Google is done selling the Nexus 5 | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
