{"Main text":"52 Comments\nThe new Godzilla was an unqualified success this past weekend, earning over $200 million globally and kicking off development of a sequel . It\u2019s a particularly impressive feat given the kitschy history of the character. Most people think of Godzilla as a camp testament to cheap special effects and terrible dubbing, but the new film sidesteps those impressions by adopting a more grounded, earnest tone , calling back to the 1954 Japanese original that used the creature to express nuclear fears in post-World War II Japan.\nWhile that\u2019s due in no small part to director Gareth Edwards, it\u2019s also thanks to the work of screenwriter Max Borenstein. While Borenstein\u2019s been impressing the industry for years with scripts like the unproduced Jimi Hendrix biopic Jimi, Godzilla is actually his first credit since his 2003 feature Swordswallowers and Thin Men (he\u2019s got Seventh Son coming next year). A few days before the movie opened, we spoke with the screenwriter to find out how he made Godzilla relevant to modern audiences, both in the film and in the graphic novel prequel Godzilla: Awakening.\nHow familiar were you with the legacy of Godzilla going in \u2014 were you already a fan?\nI became familiar originally when I sought it out, probably it was 1995 or 1994 \u2014 whenever Power Rangers hit the stage and became a big thing. They always mystified me, because it was so weird, but I was intrigued by it. \u2026 So I got into renting early \u201Csuitmation\u201D movies [films known for their use of actors in giant monster suits], and rented a bunch of the early Godzilla films from the first series and a little into the second series.\nAt the time, I was interested in the kitsch and the camp value, and thought it was funny and cool, and that\u2019s sort of where it stuck in my brain for a long time. \u2026 And then when I was approached by Legendary Pictures [to write the new movie], and when they said that Gareth was involved, I went back and rented the first film \u2014 but the Japanese cut, which I had never seen. I had only seen the Raymond Burr version [that was dubbed and recut for US audiences]. And it blew me away, because it\u2019s actually this harrowing, gritty allegory for nuclear war that\u2019s very different from the film that followed. It was a revelation, because it said not only can you make a serious version of this film, and this franchise, and this character, but it was done. It was the first film; they did it. And so that got me really jazzed and excited about taking on the franchise in a new way.\nThe original \"Godzilla\" (1954). Image courtesy of Toho Co. Ltd.\nAs a writer, how do you go about pulling off that more serious take, particularly when audiences are most familiar with Godzilla as a guy in a goofy rubber suit?\nFor me, it\u2019s all about looking into two things. First, a theme that feels resonant and worthwhile, and relatable today \u2014 universally. And then from that \u2026 a set of characters that feel relatable and grounded in the same way. \u2026 We knew we wanted to do something that was grounded, so then it led us in a direction. It was about latching into what lies at the root of Godzilla, and how that can apply to today.\nThere are so many different films, and Godzilla is different in every film. You have the hokey ones, you have the scary ones. You have the ones that are about nuclear war, you have the ones that are about alien invasions, you have the ones that are about environmental catastrophes, or bioengineering. Whatever the fear of the moment was. The common denominator is that Godzilla is a force of nature, a force beyond human control.\n\"Godzilla is a force of nature, a force beyond human control.\"\nGoing from that, immediately my mind and Gareth\u2019s went to the kinds of natural disasters that we suffer seemingly all the time, lately. These huge catastrophic events, which are natural \u2014 but maybe not entirely natural, in that they\u2019ve been impacted by our own influence on the globe in some way. And also the human cost, and the toll in human lives that they take is very often the consequence of some human mistake in engineering or arrogance in building somewhere we shouldn\u2019t have built. \u2026 It\u2019s something that hits in a really core way, especially now that we as a society and civilization have gotten so advanced in terms of our other technologies and the ways that we think we\u2019re in control. You can order something from around the world and it can be in your living room within a day \u2014 but you can still get washed away by a tsunami. And it felt like Godzilla could represent that in an impactful way.\nA page from \"Godzilla: Awakening.\"\nYou also co-wrote a graphic novel prequel called Godzilla: Awakening, that features the character of Dr. Serizawa (played by Ken Watanabe in the film). Did most of it come from the backstory you\u2019d created for the film, or was it new material that you and your co-writer developed?\nThe specifics we came up with together, in terms of the other creature [that Godzilla battles] and all those things. The kernel that existed from the film, that was like the seed of the idea, was that Serizawa\u2019s father lived through the bomb at Hiroshima, and obviously that event had something to do with the first appearance of Godzilla.\nSo that was the seed, and from there we wanted to find an adversary creature that would be different from the film, because we didn\u2019t want to spoil that, but we still wanted it to exist in the same tonal space. And obviously we had certain limitations, because you don\u2019t want to destroy a city, because then you\u2019re revealing Godzilla\u2019s existence to the world, which spoils the film. And it makes the film impossible on the same timeline. So there were all these sort of creative limitations that we had to work within.\nThere\u2019s obviously a huge universe out there to draw from in Godzilla\u2019s legacy. Are there any particular creatures or eras you\u2019d like to tackle in the future?\nI love all the monsters from Godzilla lore, and if we\u2019re fortunate enough to do a sequel or any kind of expansion it would be fun to look back and see if there are any of those that would fit within the tone we\u2019ve established for ourselves. Or maybe it would be something new. I think we\u2019d have to start the same way we started this process: by just trying to ask ourselves what would fit within the grounded version of this universe that we\u2019re trying to establish, and what would feel organic to that take. And you know, I think there\u2019s a way to do a lot of different things, and if we\u2019re lucky enough to get a chance it\u2019d be really fun.\nGodzilla is now playing in theaters.
