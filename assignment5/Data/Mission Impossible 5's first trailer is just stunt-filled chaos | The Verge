{"Main text":"Mission Impossible 5's first trailer is just stunt-filled chaos\nThe movie is out in July\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe knew the fifth installment of Mission Impossible was coming this summer , but we didn't know much about it \u2014 until now. A trailer just made its way onto the internet that confirms the Christopher McQuarrie-directed film will be called Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation.\nIn the trailer, Tom Cruise gets shirtless and death-defying, Alec Baldwin looks menacing in a tux, and the villains are, presumably, villainous. MI5 reportedly pushed up its release date to avoid competition with the James Bond movie  Spectre , out in November, and the new  Star Wars film , out in December.\nVerge Video at SXSW: Waiting in line for 9 hours to see Furious 7\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
