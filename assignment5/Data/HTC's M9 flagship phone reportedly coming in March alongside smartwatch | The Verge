{"Main text":"HTC's M9 flagship phone reportedly coming in March alongside smartwatch\nThe M9 could make some big camera changes\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHTC has already begun the hype cycle for its next flagship smartphone by teasing its March 1st Mobile World Congress event , and now Bloomberg has some more details on what might be in store. The follow-up to the HTC One M8 is indeed codenamed M9, the news service reports, and features a similar design to its predecessor with gold, gray, and silver color options.\nUltrapixels move to the front\nThe rear-facing camera is said to weigh in at a hefty 20 megapixels, but that doesn't mean HTC is abandoning its UltraPixel concept entirely; the front-facing camera will reportedly use the larger pixels, which should make for better low-light selfies. The M9 will run on an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor; includes Dolby 5.1 audio technology; and comes with Sense 7, HTC's latest Android skin, according to Bloomberg.\nAlthough details are thin, the report also states that HTC's first smartwatch will be revealed in March as well. It's said to hook into Under Armour's fitness software; the sports clothing and accessories company announced a partnership with HTC at CES earlier this month.
