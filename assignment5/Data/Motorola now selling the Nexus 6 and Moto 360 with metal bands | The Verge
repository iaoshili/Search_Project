{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle Play is no longer your only avenue for getting the Nexus 6: Motorola, the phone's manufacturer, is now selling orders  directly through its own web store . Prices are obviously the same, and again you've got a choice of colors between white and midnight blue in either 32GB or 64GB. Considering how fast it's been going at the Play Store, you'll probably want to act fast if you want a 6 anytime soon. Google has said it's aiming to make more stock available every Wednesday, but it's not clear when or how often Motorola will refresh inventory.\nMotorola has also begun selling those new Moto 360s we showed you the other day. Metal options are now available with either a dark or light gray finish in the regular 23mm band size for $299.99. Well, they were, but quickly sold out. If you're holding out for a slimmer 18mm band, a silver stainless steel model will soon be available. Same goes for the champagne gold color, but you'll need to pay a bit extra for that one. Once it goes on sale, Motorola will be selling it at a bit of a premium for $329.99. As for the cognac leather band,, there's no sign of it as a bundled option with the 360, but Motorola says existing owners will soon be able to buy it separately. Accessory makers DODOcase and Tylt will be making new Moto 360 bands as well, including ones made from silicon.\nIf Motorola's smartwatch isn't to your liking, maybe LG's G Watch R will be a match for your wrist. It's now being  sold directly from Google Play for $299.99.\n","Title":"Motorola now selling the Nexus 6 and Moto 360 with metal bands | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
