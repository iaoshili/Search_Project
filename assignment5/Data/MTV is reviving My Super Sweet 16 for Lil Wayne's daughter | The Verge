{"Main text":"MTV is reviving My Super Sweet 16 for Lil Wayne's daughter\nTurns out we actually haven't had enough\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMy Super Sweet 16, MTV's reality show that documents the jaw-droppingly extravagant birthday parties of rich teenagers, is coming back. The show ended its official run in 2008, but the network is reviving it for one special 16-year-old: Lil Wayne's daughter Reginae Carter. Reginae is Lil Wayne's oldest child and his only daughter, so it's a good bet Weezy will spare no expense for her birthday joy.\nThe episode's trailer, above, brings back a flood of Sweet 16 memories: famous guests (in this case its hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd and Nicki Minaj), glittery dresses, cars being gifted before driver's licenses are obtained, pubescent shrieking, and waves of crushing jealousy. Reginae says her party in Atlanta will be \"epic,\" and we're not gonna argue.\nThe episode premieres February 16th at 7PM ET.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
