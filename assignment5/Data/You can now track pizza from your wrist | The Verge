{"Main text":"You can now track pizza from your wrist\nDomino's Tracker is now available on Pebble\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOn the whole, pizza chains have been on the forefront of food delivery. It's surprisingly easy (by design) to order a circle of cheese, sauce, and toppings by any and every mode of communication, from phones to apps to (once upon a time)  the online game EverQuest . Domino's has been apt with its efforts to control what happens between order and consumption \u2014 keeping your attention while the pizza is en route. Whether or not the play-by-play  Domino's Tracker is entirely accurate is beside the point; it's something to think about while you wait.\nNow, the Domino's Tracker has moved to your wrist \u2014 specifically Pebble, which is our pick for the  best smartwatch you can buy . Domino's PR spelled it out: \"This marks the first time that Domino's Tracker has been available on any smartwatch device.\" That's all there is to it \u2014 the gadget category meant to keep you persistently connected, and  occasionally promote fitness , will accomplish exactly one of those for pizza. You can't actually order the pizza from your wrist, but knowing what Android Wear and Apple Watch are capable of, it's only a matter of time before all pizza-related actions can be done on wrist alone.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
