Co-workers are idly curious about which smartwatch or fitness band that is; my girlfriend asks why it\u2019s so ugly and when I\u2019ll take it off. A few, like the Moto 360, prompt strangers to stop me on the street or subway and ask if that\u2019s what they think it is. (Yes, it is. Yeah it\u2019s cool, I guess. No, sorry, I can\u2019t let you wear it.)\nNo one asked about the Withings Activité. I don\u2019t think anyone knows they should.\nI\u2019ve been wearing it for a week. It\u2019s one part standard wristwatch, one part fitness tracker. It tracks your sleep, steps, and activity. It costs $450. It\u2019s beautiful: made of carefully machined sapphire, calf leather, and stainless steel. It looks like a watch in the most traditional sense.\nIt\u2019s exactly what you think it is, exactly what it should be. It\u2019s not the future of smartwatches \u2014 it\u2019s not even a smartwatch. It\u2019s just a watch, with more in common with century-old chronographs and calculator watches than the Apple Watch. And the Activité, or something like it, is almost certainly the future of watches.\nThe Activité (pronounced Ac-ti-vi-TAY) is made in Switzerland. It\u2019s Swiss Made. I know this because it\u2019s written three times on the long, slender white box the watch comes in, and because it\u2019s also written twice on the watch itself. Despite the in-your-face overpromotion, Swiss Made is actually a big deal. It\u2019s a phrase carefully regulated by the Swiss government, one designed to make sure that the \"Swiss watch\" label is given only to timepieces of the highest quality.\nThe Activité certainly earns its label. It\u2019s beautiful, carefully assembled, and yet ruggedly ready for anything you throw at it. Its stainless-steel case is almost invisible from the front, which is given almost entirely to the dome-shaped sapphire glass above the dials. When I spoke to Withings CEO Cedric Hutchings in June, he raved about what he called the double-curved glass, saying it has \"a very tiny reflection.\" There are moments, when the light catches on the glass just-so, when I get what he means. For the most part, though, the reflections on the domed glass just make it harder to tell the time unless I\u2019m looking at the watch exactly head-on. I don\u2019t mind the look, and I love the way the watch\u2019s face feels to my fingers \u2014 smooth, sleek, organic. I\u2019d just rather the Activité be a little thinner and a little flatter.\nOne size doesn't quite fit all\nThat\u2019s my only real complaint about the Activité: it\u2019s just thick enough to catch on my shirtsleeve, or my coat, or the headphone cord of the unlucky guy standing next to me on the subway. It\u2019s not a big watch, just a tall one. Actually, at a decidedly unisex 36.3mm in diameter and 1.3 ounces, I suspect buyers are more likely to complain it\u2019s too small.\nDitto the brown leather strap that came with my review unit, which is thin, finely stitched, and measurably nicer than the leather band I bought for my Seiko last year. It\u2019s also available in only one unisex size, for now, and my decidedly average-size wrists were just barely small enough to fit. Withings was actually surprisingly successful in making a single device that men or women can wear, but there are plenty of people for whom the small included strap just won\u2019t work.\nOn the Activité\u2019s round face, which comes in either black or white, are two dials. The first does that ticking thing a watch does and tells the time (but not the date, which I wish it did). It\u2019s beautifully simple, 12 silver dashes around the side, a Withings logo under the 12 and the words \"Swiss Made\" surrounding the 6. (Did you forget it was Swiss Made? How dare you!) Down in the bottom right, there\u2019s another dial. It counts from 0 to 100, with marks at intervals of ten. It\u2019s the Activité\u2019s one and only clue as to the technology that lies inside, and it\u2019s there that this becomes more than just a timepiece.\nIf you have an iPhone, the Activité syncs its data via Bluetooth to Withings\u2019 Health Mate app. (Android support is coming soon, I\u2019m told.) That\u2019s the highest-tech thing that it does. Then, whenever you\u2019re wearing the watch, it tracks your activity: your steps, your sleep, your swimming. It\u2019s not a particularly sophisticated workout device, just a simple activity tracker.\nYou'd never know there's anything unique going on inside the Activité, and that's the whole idea\nIt\u2019s all but invisible as it works. The only indication is the hand on that second dial sweeping from 0 to 100, displaying the percentage of your step goal you\u2019ve reached so far today. After a five-minute long set-up process \u2014 in which you use an included pin-like tool to turn the watch on, connect it to your phone, and set the time by spinning a dial on your phone \u2014 you never have to do anything on the watch itself again. Every setting, every feature exists only on your phone, and a lot of the Activité\u2019s job happens automatically. Its algorithms figure out what you\u2019re doing and track each activity differently. I actually wish there were more I could do on the timepiece itself, but I don't mind the way it works here.\nThe watch is meant never to come off your wrist. Its battery (which is just a watch battery) lasts eight months, and there\u2019s even a second one in the box. It\u2019s water-resistant enough to wear in the shower, as long as you switch to the included silicone strap instead of the very much not-water-resistant leather. Its silent alarm buzzes your wrist to wake you up at the appointed time, so you\u2019re even meant to wear it to sleep. Sleeping was the only time I didn\u2019t wear it; having anything on my wrist, especially something as coldly metallic as the Activité, makes it hard to fall asleep. The alarm itself is annoying, too: you can\u2019t turn it off, you just have to wait the 30 seconds or so while it buzzes on your wrist. I literally flung it across the room while it was still buzzing, one particularly early morning.\nThe Health Mate app is fairly standard activity-tracking fare. There are lovely graphs of your activity and sleep over time, and badges for when you do things like meet your step goal or sleep particularly well. You can have Withings friends who you challenge to take more steps or lose more weight. If you use a Withings scale, a Pulse fitness band, or the Aura sleep tracker, they all funnel more and better data into the same place. It also collects data from RunKeeper and similar apps, and can send it to Apple Health. The more data you collect, the more useful Health Mate becomes: it can tell you that you took fewer steps today than on an average Wednesday, or that you need to be more active in order to sleep better. The app can also programmatically remind you to, say, drink more water or get to bed early. The reminders amount to basically having your mother around yelling \"Bedtime!\" at 11:15 every night, which I loved. Health Mate isn\u2019t a terribly beautiful or intuitive app, but it does everything it needs to, and it\u2019s getting better all the time.\nNone of that, of course, has much to do with the Activité. All the watch does is feed data into that system. If you tap on the sapphire, the hands will quickly rearrange to show you what time your alarm will go off, but otherwise there\u2019s no two-way interaction at all. In a way that\u2019s frustrating, because you need your phone to do everything, including set the time, but it\u2019s actually quite clever. Since the Activité is just a dumb data-collection device, you\u2019ll never need to upgrade it to get new functionality. Withings can upgrade the Activité\u2019s firmware to read more and more accurately, and it can update its app to do absolutely everything else. Most smartwatches, especially above a certain price, are going to run into an upgrade problem: why would I spend a thousand dollars on a watch I\u2019m going to need to upgrade in a year? The Activité doesn\u2019t have that problem, because it doesn\u2019t try to do anything. You\u2019ll upgrade your phone in a year, Withings will update its app far more frequently than that, and suddenly your watch will become even more useful.\nThe lesson of the Activité is how trivially easy it is to add these data-collection tools to a wristwatch. Sure, it decreases the battery life, but certainly not enough to be an issue; it definitely doesn\u2019t require any real design compromise. It\u2019s an almost exclusively additive process, making the thing you wear on your wrist more than just a device for telling the time.\nWhy can't every watch become a slightly smarter watch?\nIf it\u2019s a smartwatch, it\u2019s the least capable smartwatch I\u2019ve ever seen. What the Activité actually represents is the new table stakes for a watch, the new minimum for a device that looks like this and costs this much. Watches can already blare sound to wake you up in the morning, so why can\u2019t they buzz quietly? Why can\u2019t I swap bands before I get in the pool and have it track my splits? It\u2019s all clearly possible, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be long before those features are as commonplace as a sweeping second-hand. Rolex, Timex, and Bulgari have all already done the hard part: building a beautiful watch. So did Withings. And it proved that the other half, the technological half, doesn\u2019t require sacrifice.\nThe price alone will turn off a lot of people, but if you\u2019re willing to spend for a good watch this is certainly a real option. But don\u2019t spend $450 on the Withings Activité because it\u2019s the latest and greatest, or because it offers some new or remarkable functionality, or because it\u2019ll be the envy of your friends. It\u2019s none of those things, and that may be the best thing about the Withings Activité. It\u2019s both deeply technical and not at all so. It feels like a watch you\u2019ll keep and care for, not a gadget you\u2019ll throw by the wayside in a year or two. The only people who notice it will tell you it\u2019s a nice watch, not inquire about that crazy bracelet or computer on your wrist.\nSmartwatches have a long way to go before they have mainstream appeal, but a slightly smarter watch? I\u2019m in.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"Withings Activité review: a slightly smarter watch | The Verge","Tags":["review","business","tech"]}
