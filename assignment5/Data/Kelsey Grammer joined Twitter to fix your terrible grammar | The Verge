{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nKelsey Grammer has joined Twitter, but not for the usual reasons. The actor, who is currently experiencing something of a career renaissance, isn't there to plug Transformers: Age of Extinction or his role in the upcoming Expendables 3. Instead, Kelsey Grammer wants to educate Twitter's masses on the rules and intricacies of English grammar. With his inaugural tweet, he even coined a hashtag to go along with the mission: #KelseyGrammerGrammar. \"It has come to my attention that the fine people of Twitter have an egregious grammar problem,\" Grammer wrote. \"I\u2019m here to help.\"\nUh oh! Dad showed up. No more fun anymore. ;-) @KelseyGrammer @twitter\n\u2014 William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) July 1, 2014\nFor 20 years, Grammer played America's favorite on-screen shrink with his portrayal of Dr. Frasier Crane \u2014 first on Cheers, and then via the spinoff series Frasier. He's also led a successful voice acting career, most notably as Sideshow Bob on The Simpsons. Grammer has already brought up his role as Bart's psychotic nemesis to help advance his cause.\n. @AnthraxJones As a @Yale graduate, I am sure Sideshow Bob would have a mutual respect for my grammatical endeavors. #KelseyGrammerGrammar\n\u2014 Kelsey Grammer (@KelseyGrammer) July 8, 2014\nMost of Grammer's lessons so far have touched on the usual suspects: people mixing up \"affect\" and \"effect\" or \"its\" and \"it's.\" But he's not shy about calling out bigger culprits like NASA for the occasional tense fumble.\nEven @NASA is guilty of the occasional grammar slip. Thanks for pointing this out, @JAWing17 #KelseyGrammerGrammar http:\/\/t.co\/hcTq2buB4w\n\u2014 Kelsey Grammer (@KelseyGrammer) July 9, 2014\nObserver recently ranÂ  a fantastic profile of Grammer, now 59, who has seen more than his fair share of tragedy in life. His father was shot and killed when Grammer was only 13. Seven years later, his sister was abducted, raped, and stabbed to death. Grammer has also struggled with addiction at times, but has persevered through these and other hardships to carve out a successful stage career on television, Broadway, and in film. Now it seems he's trying to add \"hero of the English language\" to the list.\n","Title":"Kelsey Grammer joined Twitter to fix your terrible grammar | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","entertainment"]}
