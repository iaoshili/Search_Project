{"Main text":"Portland enlists big data to make biking safer\nCan data from fitness app Strava give Portland planners insight into cyclists' habits?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMargi Bradway noticed something peculiar when she went on a biking trip last year. Before her friends got on their bikes, they all pulled out smartphones. \u201CEveryone was clicking on their Strava,\u201D she recalls. Bradway, the active transportation policy lead at the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) at the time, had an idea. Could data collected by Strava, a popular GPS-powered app that lets cyclists and runners log workouts and commutes, make her home city of Portland a safer place for bike-riders?\nPortland is already a better city than most for cyclists: Hawthorne Bridge, one of the city\u2019s five bike-friendly bridges, averages 1.7 million bike trips a year, and the city boasts 300 miles of bike lanes. But Portland relies on a very rudimentary method for collecting data on cyclists and the trips they make: volunteers count riders at various intersections around the city. Without better information, it\u2019s difficult to improve on what already exists.\nThe Department of Transportation  licensed a data set of 17,700 riders and 400,000 bike trips\nStrava might change that. Late last year, ODOT licensed a Strava metro data set of 17,700 riders and 400,000 bike trips around Portland. That adds up to 5 million BMTs (bicycle miles traveled) logged in 2013 alone. The data is now being parsed as ODOT determines what kinds of infrastructure needs that information reveals.\nThough some members of the Strava community have expressed privacy concerns, company co-founder and president Michael Horvath says that most riders are enthused about the partnership. Horvath points out that every user has the choice to opt out of the program, and that rider data \"has been disaggregated and anonymized\" to protect identities.\nFor now, the system\u2019s biggest challenge is sample bias. To use Strava, one must own a smartphone, a technology that isn\u2019t affordable for everyone. \"People being counted by Strava are those who already have a powerful voice in bicycle advocacy and whose needs are already well on their way to being met,\" says Elly Blue, Portland resident and author of Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save the Economy.\nBradway and the department know the Strava data set isn\u2019t perfect. \"But don\u2019t let perfect be the enemy of the good,\" she says. Meanwhile, municipalities around the world are taking note of Portland\u2019s progress: Strava has already partnered with 15 other cities \u2014 including Orlando and London \u2014 on similar programs. \"I think it shows that the data that we\u2019re collecting on cycling, running, and other forms of physical activity can really inform and educate,\" Horvath says. \"I\u2019d like to see it in every major [city], and even small cities around the world.\"\n","Title":"Portland enlists big data to make biking safer | The Verge","Tags":["verge-detours","transportation"]}
