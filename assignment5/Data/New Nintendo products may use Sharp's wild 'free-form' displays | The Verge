Japanese news agency  Kyodo reports that the venerable video games company will be Sharp's first client for the LCD tech, which may be used in a new portable games console or the company's upcoming sleep-tracking device . According to one source, Nintendo is considering a doughnut-shaped screen with a hole in the middle.\nNintendo is reportedly considering a doughnut-shaped screen\nNintendo and Sharp already have a supply relationship; the 3DS console uses a glasses-free 3D display provided by Sharp. The 3DS was first released in 2011, and the  latest version features a faster processor and eye-tracking technology to improve the 3D effect. With that model yet to see release in Europe or North America, a full-on successor is probably some way off; in any case, Kyodo's report says that mass production of the Free-Form Display is set to begin early 2016.\nWhen contacted by The Verge, a Sharp spokesperson said, \"The report is not based on our announcement.
