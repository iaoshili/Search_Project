Buh NUH NUH!\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nJeff Goldlblum continues to charm the millienials who will forever remember him as Dr. Ian Malcolm.  On last night's Late Night with Seth Meyers , he sang the non-canonical lyrical version of the Jurassic Park theme. If you wish to sing along, the lyrics are as follows: \"In Jurassic Park \u2014 scary in the dark \u2014 I'm so scared that I'll be eaten.\"\nGoldblum, who has a lovely voice, no question, does commendable work with the tune. But if I were to nominate one or two ditties for best rendition of the Jurassic Park theme, I'd select the following YouTube videos. Warning, the second video has some language NSFW.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
