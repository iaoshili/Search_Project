{"Main text":"118 Comments\nGiven people\u2019s desire to dump money on all sorts of self-improving pills, superfoods, fitness trackers, and life hacks, it\u2019s no wonder that Hollywood has taken to neuroscience\u2019s most persistent myth \u2014 the idea that humans only use one-fifth of their brains. Way back in 1996, John Travolta gained access to the rest of his and learned to levitate things in Phenomenon; a few years ago Limitless\u2019 Bradley Cooper took a \u201Csmart pill\u201D and used his new brain power to get super-rich playing the stock market. Now, with Lucy, France\u2019s most blockbuster-ready director Luc Besson takes a stab at the 100 percent human.\nBesson\u2019s augmented main character, having tapped into her full potential, is oddly inhuman for someone who\u2019s supposed to be her fullest possible self. The titular Lucy, as the film goes on, is able to do amazing things \u2014 levitate, for one. But in Besson\u2019s world, using more of your brain makes you increasingly abstract, so the more amazing Lucy\u2019s powers are the less she seems to enjoy them. In trying to reconcile this cool, mechanical version of the brainiest human, the movie grafts together elements of a madcap spy thriller and an oblique, existential riff reminiscent of Terrence Malick\u2019s Tree of Life.\nScarlett Johanssen\u2019s Lucy begins as a pretty, vacant undergraduate bar-hopping her way through a semester in Taipei. As the movie opens, we find her being pressured by a Bono-lookalike she\u2019s been seeing into delivering a package. Obviously, the hand-off is not to go well for Lucy, and she\u2019s shortly being dragged into a black marble hotel room, split open in the \"lower tummy\" region (the brisk black-market surgeon\u2019s term, not mine), and packed with drugs she\u2019s to deliver abroad.\nThe drug almost immediately becomes dislodged and leaks into Lucy\u2019s bloodstream, inexplicably turning her brain function up to 11. With access to ever-larger portions of her brain, Lucy can shoot a gun and learn languages instantly. She can read minds and see radio waves, levitate enemies, turn from blonde to brunette, type on two keyboards at once and make computers do things that, no matter your brain capacity, computers will never, ever do. As the movie progresses, a number flashes across the screen every time Lucy gains access to a larger percentage of her brain, basically leveling her up in the big video game of life. And for all of the interest Super Lucy shows in being able to do any of these things, she actually might as well be controlled by a joystick.\nShe can make computers do things that computers will never, ever do\nBesson\u2019s most popular work has almost always featured some form of a femme fatale \u2014 the violent, cunning female lead striking a sultry stance before she pulls the trigger and blows your brains out. In Besson\u2019s breakout The Fifth Element, Milla Jovovich\u2019s flame-haired humanoid runs circles around Bruce Willis with a giggle; Nikita\u2019s thoroughly 1990s version of the cliché has Anne Parillaud mowing down diplomats in a pixie cut.  Lucy is built for that mold \u2014 she is, quite literally, the only woman in the film, surrounded constantly by goonish and interchangeable groups of cops, scientists, and gangsters (the notable standout being Min-sik Choi, the slickest of mob bosses) all of them immediately bested by her otherworldly smarts and the click of her heels on the sidewalk.\nBut for some reason, Besson\u2019s version of hyperintelligence lifts its subjects above the basics of the human experience, and by the time she\u2019s at 40 percent Lucy\u2019s emotional capacity is on par with Robbie the Robot. \"I don\u2019t feel pain, desire,\" she tells Morgan Freeman, who plays a brain researcher softy befuddled by her predicament.\nBut without pain and desire, charm or glory, Lucy makes for a deeply uninteresting lead. When Scarlett Johanssen played an AI she was more human, and if Lucy can\u2019t eke joy out of her superhuman powers, it\u2019s almost impossible for her viewers to. It\u2019s a fact made even more frustrating given Johanssen\u2019s pre-super-drug performance, a genuinely claustrophobic 10 minutes in which the actress\u2019 body seems to physically shrink as she realizes what\u2019s in store for her.\nIt\u2019s too bad, because the fights are well-choreographed if anticlimactic, and the locations \u2014 Berlin and Paris among them \u2014 are lovely. At times, the editing can be whiplash-tight, particularly during one extended, clairvoyance-enhanced car chase, and the spare moments of deadpan humor are welcome respites from a film that tries to drop expository knowledge about the meaning of life with a straight face.\nWhen Johanssen played an AI she was more human\nThroughout the film, the action is interrupted by long, sweeping shots straight from the Discovery Channel: gazelles, pyramids, tornadoes, dolphins. It invites comparison to Terrence Malick\u2019s Tree of Life, famously interspersed with longer shots of similar material. But where Malick\u2019s intentions are usually fairly straightforward\u2014 dude loves the divine beauty of nature, okay? \u2014 importing that level of heavy-handed montaging onto a sci-fi film requires you to get your scientific theories straight, or at least have a great character as a foil. Unfortunately, the script is a weird tangle of evolutionary psychology and bootleg transhumanism, falling back on booming pseudo-profundities like \"humans are more concerned with having than being\" and \"we never really die.\"\nTowards the end, Lucy takes a sharp left turn and, unable to make good on earlier foreshadowing, breaks down into a tumble of trippy, jarring \u2014 and, yes, sort of beautiful \u2014scenes. It\u2019s heavy and more than a little ridiculous, but at least it\u2019s honest, and better than watching one of the most in-demand actresses on the planet boredly flip dudes upside down, or gaze impassively on as she experiences what should be the Best Trip of All Time. As Lucy herself says, in a flat voice, \"Knowledge doesn\u2019t bring chaos \u2014 ignorance does.\" An ignorance-free, chaos-less, post-human world sounds great and all, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t make a very satisfying action movie.\nLucy opens Friday, July 25th.
