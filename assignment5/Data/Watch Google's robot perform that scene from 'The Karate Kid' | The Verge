{"Main text":"Watch Google's robot perform that scene from 'The Karate Kid'\nWait, why are we teaching robots martial arts?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhen everyone was wondering what Google had in mind for all its new robotics companies , \"teaching robots martial arts\" was probably one of the more paranoid guesses. But here we are with a new video from Boston Dynamics, somehow both whimsical and unsettling, in which their robot Atlas balances on one leg atop a stack of cinderblocks, re-enacting that scene from The Karate Kid.\nWatch it for yourself, but note, not only is it the stuff of nightmares, it\u2019s accompanied by a shrill alarm, so you should mute your computer first.\nBoston Dynamics, which used to be funded by DARPA before getting bought by Google a year ago, also makes the animal-like robots BigDog and Cheetah. Atlas debuted in 2013 and Boston has released several videos of the robot slowly climbing over rubble and removing debris \u2014 the hope is that eventually Atlas could be sent on dangerous rescue missions. Its balance appears to have improved since the days of flailing up stairs while leaning on the wall.\nEven\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
