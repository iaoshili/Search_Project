{"Main text":"BlackBerry thinks 100M BBM downloads are impressive\nDownloads and active users are not the same thing\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBlackBerry announced that BBM has been  downloaded more than 100 million times on Android, a year and a half after the messaging app  first launched on Google's OS . The company also notes that \"100 million is great, but a billion is even better,\" adding that BBM stickers (which are similar to any other messaging app's stickers \u2014 think big, cartoonish emojis) have been sent more than a billion times by users. \"All these numbers just go to show the tremendous momentum behind BBM right now,\" claims BlackBerry.\ndownloads aren't the same as actual users\nWell, yes and no. It certainly shows people have downloaded BBM, but downloads are far from the same as active users. The former include all the people who may have just been curious about an app while the latter are the individuals who actually contribute to an app's value.\nSamsung's ChatON messaging app, for example, can boast at least  100 million Android downloads but it also happens to be  shutting down this year . Meanwhile, WhatsApp has  700 million monthly active users who exchange 30 billion messages every day \u2014 that's 50 percent bigger than the  global market for SMS messages . Mindless stat-polishing just isn't the same as actually having a successful app.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
