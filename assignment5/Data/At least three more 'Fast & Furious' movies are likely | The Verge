{"Main text":"At least three more 'Fast & Furious' movies are likely\nPraise the cinema gods\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAt  a Hollywood Reporter roundtable , Universal's Donna Langley has apparently promised the Fast & Furious franchise a long life beyond next year's Furious 7, saying \"We think there's at least three more...I think it's still a growing franchise,\"  reports Entertainment Weekly .\nFilm connoisseurs should immediately appreciate the gravity of Langley's announcement. Each movie in the franchise has been exponentially more awesome than the one before it, culminating in 2013's blockbuster Fast & Furious 6, which raked in over three quarters of a billion dollars globally and featured a Dodge Charger exploding out of the front of the bad guy's cargo plane while attempting to take off. Furious 7, meanwhile, features the late Paul Walker's character running up the roof of a bus before leaping to grab onto a Dodge Challenger that's drifting along the edge of a cliff.\nWho knows what 8, 9, and 10 will bring?\nBut critically, Langley says that there will be \"at least\" three more \u2014 that leaves room for a James Bond-style continuation, potentially spanning decades.\nIf there's a better way to go into the weekend, I can't think of one.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
