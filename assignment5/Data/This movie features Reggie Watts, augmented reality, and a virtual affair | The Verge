{"Main text":"This movie features Reggie Watts, augmented reality, and a virtual affair\nH. Jon Benjamin and Heems are also in it\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCreative Control is a black-and-white movie premiering at South by Southwest, set in near-future Brooklyn, and centered around an advanced version of Google Glass, but it will probably be better than it sounds. For one thing,  Reggie Watts , Heems, and  H. Jon Benjamin are all in it.\nPremiering tomorrow at SXSW\nThe movie was funded via a  2014 Kickstarter campaign , which describes Creative Control as the story of an ad executive who \"sort of\" has an affair with his best friend's girlfriend. From the trailer, it seems like the augmented reality glasses somehow factor into that affair, but they're largely portrayed as a useful stalking tool. Who knows what actually happens in Creative Control, but right now, its plot details are just vague enough to intrigue us.\nHere's one exchange that will sound familiar to anyone who's ever had a late-night, THC-fueled conversation:\n\"It'll be weird when we all have chips in our brains.\"\n\"Nope, it won't seem weird then. It'll seem inevitable.\"\nDirector Benjamin Dickinson made his film debut in 2012 with  First Winter , a harrowing and visually captivating movie about Brooklynites on a yoga retreat. That one's also better than it sounds.\nCreative Control premieres tomorrow at the SXSW festival in Austin.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
