{"Main text":"Ted Cruz just called net neutrality 'Obamacare for the internet' and that's bad news for everyone\nObamacare is bad, so this must be bad, right?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRepublicans just dominated Democrats in the midterm elections, and by all popular accounts Obama may become one of the lamest lame ducks in history \u2014 the GOP simply hates the guy and it seems unlikely he's going to get anything meaningful done before he leaves office. So we're now entering the presidential \"say whatever you want\" phase, marked today by  the president's strong new stance on rigorous net neutrality regulation. Republican leadership was quick to respond:\n\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.\n\u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\nThis is an insanely cynical tactic that should worry all citizens regardless of political stripe, and it's coming from the guys at the top; Ted Cruz (R-TX) is a powerful member of the GOP in the Senate and a potential presidential candidate for 2016. Republicans just took over Congress and hold the keys to policymaking for at least the next two years. If the best they can continue to come up with is repeating \"Obama is bad!\" the internet is in serious trouble.\nNet neutrality is obviously nothing like Obamacare, but Cruz and his colleagues have already demonstrated they either  don't understand what internet freedom means or they're willing to spread mendacious propaganda about it to help their friends at Verizon, Comcast, and other monopolistic ISPs.\nWashington is  mired in partisanship . Since 2008, the electorate has been subjected to an endless rhetorical tug-of-war between the GOP and Obama, who has become a remarkable manifestation of Republican fears projected on the national stage. Unfortunately, that means even rational policies that ought to be uncontroversial can become tainted by mere association with the president. If Cruz's comments today are a sneak peek at Republican opposition to net neutrality for the next two years, we'll be in for a rough ride.\nFrom the archives: Susan Crawford on how mayors can solve the broadband problem\n","Title":"Ted Cruz just called net neutrality 'Obamacare for the internet' and that's bad news for everyone | The Verge","Tags":["policy","editorial","us-world"]}
