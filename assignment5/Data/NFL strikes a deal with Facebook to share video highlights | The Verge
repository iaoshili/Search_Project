{"Main text":"NFL strikes a deal with Facebook to share video highlights\nThe NFL is notoriously cautious with its video content\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe NFL has agreed to a deal with Facebook to allow video clips of NFL games and content on the social network,  according to The Wall Street Journal . The NFL will begin posting highlights and fantasy football content to Facebook on Tuesday.\nGetting the rights to NFL content isn't easy \u2014 the league has shied away from openly sharing video clips on social media. There is no official NFL YouTube page, and all of its mobile video goes through its NFL Mobile app which is only available on Verizon. This is the second major partnership the NFL has struck with a social network, after  making a deal with Twitter last year to tweet game highlights and analysis featured on NFL.com.\nFacebook is trying to become an even bigger player in online video to provide the first substantial challenger to YouTube, and getting NFL content will no doubt help that case, at least in the US. Verizon isn't getting left out in the cold, as the company is currently the sole advertiser for the NFL clips on Facebook. Ads will follow every NFL clip, and revenue will be split between the NFL and Facebook.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
