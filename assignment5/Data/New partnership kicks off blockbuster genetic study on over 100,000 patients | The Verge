The study will be run by pharmaceutical maker Regeneron in a partnership with the around 3 million-member Geisinger Health System. Naturally, Regeneron is looking to develop new drugs that it can market, while Geisinger is hoping to improve patient care at the individual level, as the study's large size is meant to provide a high level of precision in linking genes and diseases.\nAround $100 million to analyze over 100,000 patients\nThe study will of course be quite expensive.  The New York Times pegs the total cost as around $100 million over the course of the five-year study \u2014 though it's an amount that the Times says is more than manageable for Regeneron. Regeneron reportedly plans to keep its costs down too by only analyzing a small portion of the sample DNA, performing only exome sequencing, which costs around $1,000 per sample.\nWhile there's an obvious profit motive for Regeneron, it tells the Times that many of its findings will be made public and that it believes it can still profit off of its increased familiarity with the results. That's still a big risk for Regeneron: so far, genomics hasn't proven to be the goldmine of new drugs that pharmaceuticals were hoping for. There's no indication that this time will be different \u2014 and at least one professor tells the Times that this type of research may be best suited to academia \u2014 but Regeneron appears to be banking on the study's large size to return meaningful results.\nIt's more than just pharmaceuticals and academics that will be interested in the findings though, should they provide definitive links from gene to disease or disorder. Companies such as 23andMe have turned genetics testing into a tool for those interested in learning a bit more about their health too \u2014 though some of these companies  have recently found themselves in hot water with the US Food and Drug Administration over the allegedly tenuous links between DNA and meaningful scientific results. Regeneron and Geisinger could help move those claims onto more solid ground, and they intend to release results as the study moves forward.\n","Title":"New partnership kicks off blockbuster genetic study on over 100,000 patients | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
