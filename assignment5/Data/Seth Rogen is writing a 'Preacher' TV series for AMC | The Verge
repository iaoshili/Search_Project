{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe'dÂ  heard rumors that it was in the works, but now it's official: Seth Rogen and his writing partner Evan Goldberg are working on a television adaption of Preacher. AMC has announced that the duo are working on a dramatic adaptation of Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon's comic book series, which tracks a reverend named Jesse Custer who loses his faith in God and sets out to settle the score with the Almighty.\n\"We've tried for seven years to work on Preacher and we're so psyched AMC is finally letting us,\" the writing duo said in a statement. \"It is our favorite comic of all time, and we're going to do everything we can to do it right.\" The pair most recently wrote the comedy This is the End, and while they may seem to have a light touch for Preacher they're going to have significant assistance from someone that knows how to mix comedy and drama: Breaking Bad veteran Sam Catlin will serve as showrunner and executive producer on the new series.\n\"I'm particularly impressed that Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and Sam Catlin understand Preacher fully \u2014 meaning they get it for what it is, not some vague approximation,\" Ennis said. \"All in all, it looks like Preacher can now be brought to TV in a way that I'd previously not have thought possible, and I very much appreciate that Steve and I have been included in the conversation in the way that we have.\"\n","Title":"Seth Rogen is writing a 'Preacher' TV series for AMC | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
