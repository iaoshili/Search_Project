While they reportedly don't believe that specific rumor to be true, they say that they did find German coins and porcelain at the location. The coins were dated in the 1930s and '40s. The buildings are located in the northeast corner of Argentina, in a nature reserve near the border of Paraguay.\nIt's likely no one ever lived there\n\"Apparently, halfway through the Second World War, the Nazis had a secret project of building shelters for top leaders in the event of defeat,\" research leader Daniel Schavelzon tells an Argentine newspaper, Clarín, according to a translation  in The Telegraph , \"inaccessible sites, in the middle of deserts, in the mountains, on a cliff, or in the middle of the jungle like this.\"\nThe researchers reportedly told Clarín that the buildings' architecture was notably different from anything in the area around them. But despite their oddities and apparent links to Nazis, the researchers say that the buildings' exact purpose and the circumstances of their creation are still unknown. It's likely that Nazis never actually lived there, because Argentina, ultimately, proved friendly to Nazis and allowed them to stay in the country quite freely.\n","Title":"Secret Nazi lair possibly discovered in Argentina | The Verge","Tags":["us-world"]}
