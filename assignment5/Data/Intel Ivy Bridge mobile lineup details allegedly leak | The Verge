{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDetails on Intel's Ivy Bridge mobile CPU lineup may have leaked, just three days after supposed information on its desktop versions surfaced. According to alleged internal documents published by VR-Zone, Intel is doing away with the low-voltage variant seen in Sandy Bridge, condensing the product line down to just standard voltage and ultra-low voltage (think ultrabook) versions. Intel now allows for programmable TDP in its mobile processors, making the low-voltage products redundant.\nThe standard-voltage line will bring a modest speed bump to laptop users, with options ranging from a 2.6GHz dual-core i5 to a 2.9GHz quad-core i7 \"Extreme Edition.\" As for the chips likely to end up in next year's deluge of ultrabooks , Intel will be launching two different models: a 1.8GHz dual-core i5, capable of 2.8GHz single-core turbo speeds, and a 2GHz dual-core i7, with a single-core turbo maximum of 3.2GHz. As for i3 options, they're not to be seen on the roadmap whatsoever, though whether this is a temporary omission or a permanent choice is still unclear.\nAll models across the lineup feature Intel HD 4000 graphics and 1600MHz DDR3 RAM, with the quad-core chips listed as being available in April. The rest of the lineup will follow in May. We expect to have official, honest-to-goodness details for you after Intel's keynote this January at CES.\n","Title":"Intel Ivy Bridge mobile lineup details allegedly leak | The Verge","Tags":["ces-2012","design","architecture\",\"Story Streams\"","\"2375440"]}
