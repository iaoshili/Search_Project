{"Main text":"The best 'Dune' movie that never was\n'Jodorowsky's Dune' documentary hits theaters next month\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony Pictures Classics this week released theÂ  first full-length trailer for Jodorowsky's Dune \u2014 a forthcoming documentary that goes behind the scenes on the craziest Dune adaptation that never was. Directed by Frank Pavich, the film tells the story of Chilean-French director Alejandro Jodorowsky, who spent a good chunk of the 1970s trying to adapt Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel to the big screen. It never happened, of course, but the possibilities are trippy and tantalizing.\nThe film would've starred Jodorowsky's 12-year-old son as part of a cast that included Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, and Salvador Dali, as the mad emperor of the galaxy. Jodorowsky also approached Pink Floyd and Peter Gabriel about scoring the film, and wanted H.R. Giger and Jean Giraud to work on the set design. The director's ambitions were grand, despite the fact that he hadn't even read Dune.\n\"I wanted to make something sacred,\" Jodorowsky says in the trailer released this week. \"A film that gives LSD hallucinations without taking LSD.\"\nPavich's documentary debuted to glowing reviews at last year's Cannes Film Festival, and will be released in theaters on March 7th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
