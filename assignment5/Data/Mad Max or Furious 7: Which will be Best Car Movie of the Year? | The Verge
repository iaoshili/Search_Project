{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI adore the Fast and Furious franchise, so much so that I've collaborated with the video team on a very special, very large project that will run later this week. And yet I'm still a little skeptical of Furious 7. Based purely off the trailers, the film appears to have less emphasis on practical effects than its predecessors, replacing what I love with gun battles and computer-animated set pieces. The movie that appears to nail the stunt work I loved in previous Fast films is Mad Max: Fury Road. The long in-development reboot of the Mad Max franchise has its share of CG, no questions, but its car sequences \u2014 which are rumored to comprise the entirety of the film \u2014 appear to have been shot with actual cars. That's all I want, y'all. Well, that and a story about the power of family. When it comes to family, Furious films will always have one muscular leg up.\nFellow Fast and Furious super fan Chris Ziegler and I are debating which film that we haven't seen will be the car movie of the year. Let's have a vote! I've include some Mad Max gifs to help you decide.\nHere are some Furious 7 gifs. Ignore Ross' comment, posted before the story event went live. Who does this guy think he is? Anyway, I hope you love CG!\nReticulating poll splines...\n","Title":"Mad Max or Furious 7: Which will be Best Car Movie of the Year? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
