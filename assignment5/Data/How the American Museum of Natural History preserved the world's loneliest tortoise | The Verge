{"Main text":"How the American Museum of Natural History preserved the world's loneliest tortoise\nMuseums are using dead animals to help us appreciate the living ones\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLonesome George was the last of his subspecies and that was just half his troubles. The Pinta island tortoise spent a portion of his life being nudged to mate with a similar species, but all three clutches of eggs never developed into offspring. Upon his death, the poor guy was shipped from the Galápagos Islands to the American Museum of Natural History for taxidermy. And now he's part of a dispute between the Galápagos and the Ecuadorian governments, who want his well-maintained corpse to be displayed in different places. According to some scientists, Old George lived for over 100 years, and he can now exist 100 more as a symbol of the world's need for improved conservation efforts. Because no critter deserves a century of loneliness, not even the lowliest tortoise.\nThis documentary short is about Lonesome George, but also the intense process behind preserving a specimen. It's good to know the immensely talented team at the AMNH could make Lonesome George look good after life. He'll be admired by thousands in the American museum alone. He won't be so lonesome anymore.\nUnrelated: This scientist is older Haley Joel Osment, right?\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
