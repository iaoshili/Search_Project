{"Main text":"Watch the first clip from Halt and Catch Fire Season 2\nReturns to AMC on May 31st\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHalt and Catch Fire, AMC's fictionalized account of a competitor in the early computer race, will start its second season on May 31st. The show is one of AMC's more prominent attempts to strike gold once again on hourlong dramas. So far, Halt hasn't lived up to those high hopes \u2014 but then, Breaking Bad and Mad Men both grew dramatically as they went on. A second season gives Halt an important chance to win over critics by fleshing out its period setting and shedding the early impressions that it's just Mad Men in 1980s Texas. It'll also pick up on the interesting new plot line of its female stars splitting off for a new startup.\nAlongside announcing Season 2's premiere date this afternoon, AMC also debuted a long first look at it. If you aren't already caught up on the show, you'll have a good opportunity to do so before it premieres at the end of May: its full first season will be on Netflix starting April 8th. Halt's first season is only 10 episodes long, so it won't take too long to get ready.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
