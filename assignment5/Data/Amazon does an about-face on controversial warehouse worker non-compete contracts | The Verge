{"Main text":"Amazon does an about-face on controversial warehouse worker non-compete contracts\nCompany says it's removing a clause that could keep hourly employees from working elsewhere for 18 months\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon is rolling back a controversial non-compete clause in its contracts for warehouse workers (including temporary ones) that could have kept them from working at competing companies for a year and a half. \"That clause hasn\u2019t been applied to hourly associates, and we\u2019re removing it,\" a company spokesperson told  The Guardian .\nA very wide-ranging clause\nThe controversial contract details were first reported by The Verge yesterday , and quickly drew public ire given their broad scope. Amazon sells just about everything, and the clause in question prohibited workers from going to a company that \"directly or indirectly\" competed with Amazon for a year and a half after their tenure. Even if Amazon never enforced the contract, it could still discourage workers from seeking employment elsewhere. Amazon also required workers to reaffirm their contracts, which included the non-compete clause, in exchange for severance after being laid off.\nAmazon did not respond to repeated requests for comments before the publishing of The Verge's initial report on the contracts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this latest change.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
