{"Main text":"Meta M1 smartwatch now starts at $149\nNew Misfit integration turns it into a step and sleep tracker as well\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMeta, the company that spun off from Fossil to produce its own smartwatches, stands directly in the path of  the oncoming Apple Watch steam train . Although Meta's M1 stands as  one of our favorite smartwatches of the past year, the company is in danger of being deluged by Apple's upcoming marketing and retail blitz. To counteract that threat, Meta is increasing the value of its watch by, firstly, chopping down its starting price to $149, and, secondly, adding new functionality through a partnership with fitness outfit Misfit.\nThe $100 price cut pulls the Meta M1 down into a much more affordable category, while the new Misfit watch face and motion tracking enhance the watch's utility. You'll be able to get some simple pedometer metrics without a Misfit account, but once you sign up, the options open up to include sleep monitoring and historic data visualizations. The software update should be rolling out now via the Meta Manager app for iOS and Android, and the discounted Meta watches are already available to buy.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
