{"Main text":"The best action camera you can buy\nHow to capture your craziest moments\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAction cameras are about more than just capturing crazy stunts these days \u2014 they\u2019ve become a way to make anything you do look cool. You\u2019ve probably seen people wave a selfie stick around while riding a bike, or strap a camera to their chest at a sporting event. Or maybe they\u2019re even using them to see what their pet sees.\nSure, a lot can be done with your camera\u2019s phone these days, thanks to burst-shooting modes and slow-motion options, but having a camera that\u2019s more durable and more powerful can make all the difference in those amazing moments you don\u2019t want to miss.\nA good action camera should be able to capture all of what you\u2019re doing with quality footage, have a great ecosystem of accessories and mounts, and offer tons of functionality that\u2019s easy to tweak. It should also be able to take a hit or two (or three) while being small and light enough to fit wherever you want to capture the action from.\nShot on location at Grand Prix New York . Also available onÂ  YouTube .\nThe Winner\nGoPro Hero 4 Black\nThe best action camera you can buy right now is also the most obvious: the GoPro Hero 4 Black edition. The $499 price tag is steep, but there's no end to what you can do with this camera. It's small, light, and durable, and every setting can be tweaked to fit the needs of whatever you're filming.\nIn any mode, the quality of the footage is stunning. Whether you're shooting at 720p or 4K, the GoPro's dynamic range is able to keep the sky from looking blown out while not underexposing the subject you're focused on. It also handles low-light situations better than any of its competitors.\nWhere GoPro also wins big is in its accessory ecosystem. The company makes just about every mount, strap, and suction cup you could want, and if they somehow don't have what you're looking for, there's a number of third-party accessory makers who have been supporting GoPros for years. GoPro also has a great phone app, by far the best on the market in both design and functionality. Every little setting can be tweaked.\nGoPro's cameras aren't without their own drawbacks though. The price isn't easy to swallow, but that's because you're looking at the most capable action camera on the market, hands down. The on-camera menu system is still a chore to navigate with just three physical buttons, and the battery struggles to last more than an hour and a half depending on the settings \u2014 even with an extra battery pack. GoPro's most expensive camera has done enough to keep it out in front of the competition, but there's still room for improvement.\nLuckily, there are a few good options for a little bit less.\nThe Runner Up\nGoPro Hero 4 Silver\nOne of those is the GoPro Hero 4 Silver edition. For $100 less than the Hero 4 Black, you trade the ability to shoot in the highest resolutions and frame rates, but you gain a touchscreen that actually makes navigating GoPro's menu system easy. It also means you're able to compose your shot without needing to turn on the phone app or buy an extra accessory. That's nice, but in most situations you're going to want to use the camera with a protective housing around it which means the screen isn't a surefire selling point.\nThe Silver edition works just as nicely with everything in the GoPro ecosystem, too, from the mounts to the app. It's an extremely capable camera that edges out the competition on its own, but not without the two big flaws with GoPro: battery life and price. GoPro does make a bargain option now \u2014 the Hero \u2014 which retails for about $130, but it does too little for the price compared to what the rest of these cameras are capable of.\nThe Others\n","Title":"The best action camera you can buy | The Verge","Tags":["photography","review","tech","this-is-my-next\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5691344"]}
