{"Main text":"The Los Angeles subway system will finally get cell service and Wi-Fi\nThe two-year, $800,000 project is underway\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (aka Metro) has broken ground on a multi-phase project to bring cellular service and Wi-Fi to the Los Angeles subway system,  the Los Angeles Daily News reports .\nThe project is slated for completion in 2017\nThe system's Red Line, which runs from Union Station in Downtown LA to North Hollywood, will be the first line to receive the long-awaited upgrade after years of foot-dragging. Robert Fischer, Metro\u2019s systems project manager, told the Daily News the project's contract was awarded nearly two years ago, but security fears and concerns about interfering with radio communication among first-responders delayed the project.\nMetro\u2019s contractor, InSite Wireless, LLC, will bring Wi-Fi and cell service to four Red Line stations \u2014 Westlake, Wilshire \/ Western, Wilshire \/ Vermont, and Vermont \/ Sunset \u2014 before extending service to North Hollywood, and then to Pasadena and East LA on the Gold Line. The project will take an estimated $800,000 and two years to complete.\nThe small, much-maligned Metro is the most recent US city subway system to offer Wi-Fi and cell service. New York City began  rolling out cell service in its subways back in 2011 , and in 2013, it  ramped up its efforts to include Wi-Fi and cell service in dozens of stations across the city. Boston and Washington, DC have also  experimented with underground cell service and Wi-Fi in recent years.\nIt's still the Los Angeles subway\nFischer says Wi-Fi will only be available on station platforms and not on trains, while passengers should have continuous cell service in stations and on moving trains.\nThis development doesn't really change the fact that the Los Angeles Metro is small, agonizingly slow and stops running at 2AM on weekends. But it does give us hope that New York's  wireless underground orchestra will be able to take its show on the road.\n","Title":"The Los Angeles subway system will finally get cell service and Wi-Fi | The Verge","Tags":["tech","transportation"]}
