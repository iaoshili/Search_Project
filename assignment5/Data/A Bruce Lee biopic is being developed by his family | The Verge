{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBruce Lee is widely considered to be one of the greatest martial artists who ever lived, and he is revered for his contributions to film and culture. However, much of who he was beyond his writing and work onscreen is still a mystery to audiences. Shannon Lee, Bruce Lee's daughter,  today announced that she is developing a definitive biopic on the action icon with Hollywood help, aiming to capture the essence of her father in a way that previous films have failed to do.\n\"There have been projects out there involving my father, but they\u2019ve lacked a complete understanding of his philosophies and artistry,\" Lee told Deadline. \"They haven\u2019t captured the essence of his beliefs in martial arts or storytelling. The only way to get audiences to understand the depth and uniqueness of my father is to generate our own material and find amazing like-minded partners to work with.\"\nPlenty of story left to tell about Bruce Lee's life\nThe untitled film is being produced by Bruce Lee Entertainment, which opened last year to create content about the martial artist, and it will be the first movie of its kind to be produced with the full support of his family. The last movie to attempt to tell Lee's life story, Dragon, was  a well-received effort when it hit theaters in 1993. Still, Shannon Lee contends that there's still plenty of story to tell about father's short life and philosophy.\n","Title":"A Bruce Lee biopic is being developed by his family | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
