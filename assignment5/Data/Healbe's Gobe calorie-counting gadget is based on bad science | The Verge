The idea is to make it as easy as possible to count calories \u2014 but  calorie counting isn't a great measure. Worse, when I asked whether the  product had been tested, with results published in a peer-reviewed  journal (like Science or Nature), George Mikaberidze, the company's managing director, didn't seen to understand the question I was asking.\nA self-published study doesn't inspire confidence\nPeer-reviewed publication is the gold standard for study results in  health. Sadly, self-publishing a study doesn't meet those standards; it doesn't inspire much confidence.  Mikaberidze was eager to tell me that Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New  YorkÂ  and the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Health\u2019s Medical and  Sports Clinic had tested the device. I was referred to the website to  see the study and results.\nOn the website, I saw no indication that Sloan-Kettering had been involved. Only 6 people were involved in the tests \u2014 a miniscule number by health study standards. In this tiny study, the  calorie counter was found to measure calorie intake plus or minus a 15  percent error rate \u2014 a large error margin. There's more hope  than science in this calorie counter.\nThe gadget will ship to Indiegogo backers at the end of the month.\n","Title":"Healbe's Gobe calorie-counting gadget is based on bad science | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech","ces-2015"]}
