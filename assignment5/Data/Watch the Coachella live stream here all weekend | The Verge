{"Main text":"Watch the Coachella live stream here all weekend\nYou can watch specific acts tonight, Saturday, and Sunday\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEven though Coachella is just a gathering of chaotic floral mayhem in the desert created by people with  font biases and a  dislike of selfie sticks , it's still relatively appealing from a musical perspective. And if you've been wishing there was a way you could see some of the acts without actually going to Coachella, you're in luck.\nToday, tomorrow, and Sunday, Coachella will live stream certain sets from acts in its lineup on YouTube. Today's stream is already up, and will feature sets from The War on Drugs, Interpol, Tame Impala, and more. Saturday and Sunday will feature Jamie XX, Mac DeMarco, FKA Twigs, Run the Jewels, and Perfume Genius, among others. You can watch the sets on webcast channel one above and sets from channel two and three below.
