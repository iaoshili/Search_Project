{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft doesn't plan on making the same mistake twice: the company has made a public pledge that all of Nokia's Lumia Windows Phone 8 devices will be upgraded to the mobile version of Windows 10 when it's released. Responding to a customer's question on the topic, Microsoft tweeted, \"We plan to upgrade all Windows Phone 8 devices to Windows 10 in the future.\" Microsoft's next big operating system remains in early development, so the company obviously isn't revealing details as to when that update will arrive.\n@Kalars07 We plan to upgrade all Windows Phone 8 devices to Windows 10 in the future :)\n\u2014 Lumia (@lumia) November 13, 2014\nStill, the direct confirmation should allow Lumia owners to breathe a sigh of relief and know that history won't repeat itself. Microsoft enraged its small but loyal base of Windows Phone 7 users when it revealed existing devices wouldn't make the jump to Windows Phone 8 in 2012. That was mostly due to a significant change in the software's kernel, but the technical explanation did little to heal the wound. The underpinnings between Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 aren't so drastically different, so another cutoff wasn't expected. But a promise that every last Lumia running Windows Phone 8 will get Microsoft's latest software is still good to hear.\n","Title":"Microsoft: all Lumia Windows Phone 8 devices will be upgraded to Windows 10 | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tech"]}
