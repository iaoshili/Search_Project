{"Main text":"FCC fines Verizon $3.4 million for not telling officials about a major 911 outage\n750,000 people in California were unable to call 911 for hours\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn October, the FCC released a damning reporting suggesting a major 911 outage affecting more than 11 million people in seven states  could have been prevented . But there was, apparently, more to the story: during the April outage, Verizon failed in its responsibility to alert officials, and the FCC is now  fining the company $3.4 million for the 750,000 residents of California affected.\n750,000 people in California were affected\nUnder FCC regulations, service providers are required to alert Public Safety Answering Points, which field 911 calls, when there is an outage. Verizon, the FCC notes, failed to do this in Northern California, and 62 wireless emergency calls failed. (Verizon argued that a subcontractor responsible for routing the emergency calls didn't alert the company until the outage was over, but the FCC has decided Verizon is still ultimately responsible.)\nAlong with the fine, the FCC order will require Verizon to institute what the commission calls \"a far-reaching compliance plan\" to ensure the same situation doesn't happen again. Everyone relying on emergency services can only hope, as October's FCC report suggested outages are on the rise.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
