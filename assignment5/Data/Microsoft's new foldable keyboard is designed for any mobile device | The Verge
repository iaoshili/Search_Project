{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft originally created a universal keyboard for iOS, Android, and Windows back in September, and now the company is announcing a foldable version. The Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard (yes, that\u2019s the full name) is similar to the original, with Bluetooth connectivity to work across multiple devices, and a lack of a dedicated Windows key. While the original wasn\u2019t foldable, this new version folds up neatly with magnets to keep it closed if you\u2019re carrying it in a bag alongside your device.\nMicrosoft has ditched dedicated function keys at the top of its latest universal keyboard, but there\u2019s a function key for the usual audio controls, search functionality, and more. The keyboard can pair with two devices at a time and switch between them with one touch. While there\u2019s also a lack of a neat stand for your tablet on phone, you do get the benefits of a lightweight keyboard and the ability to fold it away easily. I got a chance to try the new keyboard at Mobile World Congress today, and I think this might be my next tablet keyboard. Battery life is up to three months before you need to charge it again using the micro USB connector at the side. It\u2019s very thin and the soft material feels like it would stick to a desk well without slipping away.\nThis feels like the perfect accessory for writing a few emails from your tablet or phone at a coffee shop while you\u2019re on the go. Microsoft has always made great keyboards and mice for Windows-powered devices, and if the company continues to create good keyboards for iOS and Android then I\u2019m going to find myself owning a lot of Microsoft keyboards in the near future.\nMicrosoft says the keyboard will costÂ $99.95 when it's released in July.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Microsoft's new foldable keyboard is designed for any mobile device | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","hands--on","tech","mwc-2015"]}
