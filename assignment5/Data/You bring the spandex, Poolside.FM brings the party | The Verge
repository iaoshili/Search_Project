{"Main text":"You bring the spandex, Poolside.FM brings the party\n'80s VHS video clips pump up the summer jamz\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPoolside.FM could be the perfect accompaniment to rising temperatures and the imminent arrival of outdoor barbecues. The website created by Marty Bell and Grant MacLennan pairs nostalgic video clips from the halcyon days of the '80s with user-submitted audio tracks. The footage on Poolside.FM originates from a YouTube playlist consisting of old advertisements and scenes from classic movies like Back to the Beach and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The result is a myriad of idyllic vignettes featuring rollerbladers, women with enormous hair, and people doing aerobics in leotards set to music evocative of the decade.\nThe two-man team behind Poolside.FM has done a fantastic job at ensuring that the songs match the videos, creating an overall experience that drips teenage dreams and summer heat. For those who didn't grow up with '80s Americana, it's also a fascinating glimpse of what passed for cool in the era. Be advised that while most of the videos on Poolside.FM are relatively tame, the site contains enough provocative shots of scantily-clad women to make it inappropriate for the workplace.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
