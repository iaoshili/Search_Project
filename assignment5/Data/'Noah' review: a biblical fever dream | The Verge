{"Main text":"643 Comments\nIt\u2019s been easy to snicker at Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah. The notion of the Requiem for a Dream filmmaker taking on a Bible epic was enough to raise eyebrows, and trailers framing the film as a Day After Tomorrow-style action ride only added to the confusion. Controversy swirled, and as news broke that Paramount was testing out alternate cuts in an effort to appease religious audiences, it begged the question: just what was Aronofsky up to?\nAs it turns out, he was making a much more challenging and compelling movie than anyone saw coming. Whether it will ever find an audience\u2026 well, that\u2019s another story entirely.\nThere's never been a religious film quite like this\nI\u2019m not going to worry about the religious veracity of Noah \u2014 and if you hope to enjoy it, neither should you. Paramount is touting the film as being \"inspired\" by the Book of Genesis, but Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel pull in elements from other texts and freely move pieces around to benefit the narrative. But the major plot points remain intact: several generations after humanity was kicked out of the Garden of Eden, wickedness and cruelty have spread across the world. The descendants of Cain \u2014 the first human to commit murder when he killed his brother Abel \u2014 are largely to blame, and God decides to reboot Earth entirely. In a series of visions, Noah (Russell Crowe) is told there will be a great flood, and that he and his family must build an ark to save the animals of the world so they can repopulate the planet.\nFrom the opening moments it\u2019s clear there's never been a religious film quite like this. A quick, impressionistic prologue jumps through Genesis, and then we\u2019re introduced to a world of green mountains, rocky plains, and glowing skies. This proto-Earth is a visually striking fantasy world \u2014 more Lord of the Rings than Passion of the Christ \u2014 but there\u2019s an immediacy to it thanks to the gritty, handheld camera work of cinematographer Matthew Libatique. Aronofsky\u2019s penchant for nightmarish imagery also serves him well as Noah is overwhelmed by the horrific visions sent his way; one moment he\u2019s standing in a blood-soaked plain, the next he\u2019s screaming beneath the ocean surface as thousands of corpses float beside him.\nA playground for unfortunate melodrama\nNoah and his family are assisted by a group of stone titans called Watchers, fallen angels bound to Earth for helping humanity in the past. Imagine if Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers were made of rock and you\u2019ll get the idea, but the concept actually plays thanks to the film\u2019s larger fantasy canvas. When it comes to the legions of animals, Industrial Light & Magic\u2019s visual effects hit a perfect note of stylized realism \u2014 something that\u2019s really utilized once the rain begins to fall.\nQuite simply, the great flood is a marvel. I don\u2019t know that simulated water has ever looked this real before, and as tidal waves rush in to batter the ark every other disaster movie fades from memory. But the spectacle\u2019s not the point. Noah is a man haunted by the darker side of prophecy. Once the ark is afloat he hunkers down inside, tortured as the screams of those outside swirl around him. Convinced that his creator wants to wipe humanity out completely, he pushes his family away by drawing an impossibly hard line with his wife and children. He curses the actions he feels forced to take while simultaneously insisting he has no alternative. In many ways Noah is a Bible story about the destructive nature of blind faith, an audacious choice that gives the story weight even though we already know the ending (spoiler: humanity survives).\nThe grand setting also serves as a playground for unfortunate melodrama, an issue that Aronofsky\u2019s run into before. Ray Winstone and Jennifer Connelly are both wonderfully consistent actors, but here \u2014 as Noah\u2019s nemesis and his wife, respectively \u2014 they barrel into the land of groan-worthy theatricality, particularly when playing off the quiet, resolute side of Crowe. As Methuselah, Anthony Hopkins chews the same scenery he\u2019s been working on in the last two Thor films, while Noah\u2019s three sons come off as vague outlines. It\u2019s Emma Watson (the Harry Potter series) that steps in to bind the cast together. As Noah\u2019s adopted daughter, Ila, she\u2019s vulnerable and human, providing the gut-level emotional stakes the movie desperately needs once everyone heads inside the ark.\nIt\u2019s such an odd mix of styles and choices that it\u2019s hard to believe it holds together at all \u2014 but thanks to Aronofsky\u2019s earnest commitment, it does. More than anything else, the movie calls to mind Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, another inventive take on a well-known tale that dazzles even while carrying the burden of some significant flaws.\nIn a sense, Noah seems almost designed to underwhelm at the box office. Rather than leaning on spectacle or the easy crutch of a well-known tale, it challenges audiences with its portrayal of a mysterious, often cruel creator. It dares the viewer to hate its hero, and the unrelenting beliefs turning him from man to monster. And then Noah reveals its true areas of interest: the giving nature of the human heart, and the power of free will in the face of dogma. Those are noble sentiments to explore no matter what you believe in, but it takes such a weird and wild boat ride to get there you start to wonder who the film is for. Despite those weaknesses, however \u2014 or perhaps because of them \u2014 Noah delivers the one thing that is so often missing from tentpole movies: a soul.\nDarren Aronofsky\u2019s Noah is now playing.
