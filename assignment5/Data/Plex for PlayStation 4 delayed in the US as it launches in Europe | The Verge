{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nXbox One owners have already beenÂ  enjoying the delights of Plex for two months , and it\u2019s now arriving on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3 just in time for the holidays. Plex has emerged as a go-to app for home theater diehards, and a popular choice for people who download movie and TV show rips. On PlayStation 4 it looks identical to the Xbox One version, with a horizontal interface to organize all your movies and TV shows. Recently added movies are available front and center, and music \/ photo support is coming at a later date.\nPlex is debuting in Europe and Asia today, but a US launch \"will happen in the near future\" according to the company. The odd delay could be down to Sony as Plex notes \"it takes a while to work out all the details with Sony.\" While Plex Media Server is free on a PC or Mac, the PS4 app is limited to Plex Pass subscribers initially \u2014 just like the Xbox One version. A one-time fee version is expected at a later date, but for now you\u2019ll need to pay $4.99 a month to access the app and the various Plex Pass subscriber options. If you\u2019re in Europe or Asia then Plex is available immediately in the PlayStation Store.\n","Title":"Plex for PlayStation 4 delayed in the US as it launches in Europe | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
