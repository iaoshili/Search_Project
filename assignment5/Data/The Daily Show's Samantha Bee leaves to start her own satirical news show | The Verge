{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast month  Jon Stewart announced he would be leaving The Daily Show , ending a run that's lasted more than 15 years and changed the way we consume news. Today it's correspondent Samantha Bee's time to jump ship, and she'll be heading over to host her own satirical news show at TBS.  Turner made the announcement today , stating that it had signed Bee to the program, which is still in the early stages of development.\nBee is the second Daily Show alum that TBS has poached since Stewart's announcement. Last month Jason Jones \u2014 who is married to Bee \u2014  announced that he would be leaving to devote his time to a new scripted show for the network. Jones and Bee wrote the pilot for the scripted show together, which is said to be inspired by their own experiences taking family vacations. They will serve as executive producers on both programs.\n'The Daily Show' became a breeding ground for creative talent under Stewart\nThe Daily Show became a  breeding ground for comedic talent under Stewart's tenure, with the likes of Steve Carrell, Stephen Colbert, Kristen Schaal, and John Oliver all appearing on the program \u2014 and that's just scratching the surface. With many of those individuals having already moved on to their own programs, it's no surprise to see Jones and Bee do the same thing, though one could argue that Bee would have been a strong choice to lead up the new iteration of The Daily Show after Stewart leaves. Instead, it appears that Comedy Central will very likely be starting from scratch with a new host and a new set of on-air talent. Whomever those people end up being, they'll have some very large shoes to fill.\n","Title":"The Daily Show's Samantha Bee leaves to start her own satirical news show | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
