{"Main text":"This insane $300 Android game controller is also a Transformer\nIt has claws\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAlmost every third-party gamepad you can buy looks remarkably like an Xbox controller \u2014 but there's nothing that looks quite like Mad Catz's insane new transforming gamepad. Called the LYNX 9 Mobile Hybrid Controller, the gamepad is designed to work with both your PC and Android devices, and it can change shapes to better suit whatever platform you're on.\nIt can wrap around a tablet, hold a smartphone in place, and you can even snap in a QWERTY keyboard so you can chat while you play. And when you're all done, the Bluetooth-powered controller folds up nice and neat. The modular device also features a built-in mic, has an estimated 30 hours of battery life, and comes with an Android app so you can configure and tweak the sticks and buttons, much like you would on a PC.\nAll of that customization comes at a price, though \u2014 the LYNX 9 will run you a hefty $299.99. It's expected to start shipping in March .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
