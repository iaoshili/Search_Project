{"Main text":"Drone packed with crystal meth crashes near US-Mexico border\nPolice say aircraft crashed under the weight of its illicit package\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA drone packed with drugs crashed this week near the US border with Mexico, police in Tijuana  announced Wednesday. As the  Associated Press reports , the remote-controlled aircraft was packed with more than six pounds of crystal meth, divided into six packets. The six-propeller drone was likely unable to bear the weight of the drugs, police say, causing it to crash into a supermarket parking lot near the San Ysidro crossing along the Mexico-California border. Police have yet to name any suspects.\nJorge Morrua, spokesman for the Tijuana police, tells the AP that this isn't the first time authorities have seen drones used for drug smuggling. Last year, a source at the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) told a Mexican news outlet that in 2012, drug-packed drones made  at least 150 attempts to cross the border. The technology has been used to transport drugs away from the border, as well. Last year, a drone  crashed while attempting to transport marijuana to a South Carolina maximum security prison, and a man in Australia was  arrested for making a similar attempt near a Melbourne prison.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
