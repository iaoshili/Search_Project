According to the  Associated Press , the drones will use the Misawa Air Base in northern Japan through October, though the US government has not provided any details on the missions that will be carried out.\nSame drones used to track hurricanes\nThe Global Hawk drones are made by aerospace and military contractor Northrop Grumman, and specialize in long-distance, high-altitude unmanned flights. Last year, a Global Hawk flew for more than 34 hours at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet. It  also set a record in 2001 for flying unmanned across the Pacific Ocean in less than a day. Japan intends to buy three of the drones, the AP says.\nThese particular drones have  a history of both military and humanitarian use . The aircraft was used to help find and kill Osama bin Laden, but it was also tapped by NASA to track hurricanes. More recently, the drones were used in a NATO trial, which  took them through UK airspace for the first time ever this week. They were also utilized for reconnaissance on the Nigerian girls  who were kidnapped last month .\n","Title":"The US has deployed a pair of surveillance drones to Japan | The Verge","Tags":["us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3759737"]}
