Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed the decision in an upcoming interview with  Bloomberg Television today , adding that the Oscar-winning actor didn't even have to audition for the role.\n\"We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that\u2019s Chris Bale,\" Sorkin said. \"He didn\u2019t have to audition. Well, there was a meeting.\"\nBale was among the actors  reported to be in contention for the lead role, along with Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, and Leonardo DiCaprio. The still-unnamed film is based on  Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography about Jobs, and shooting will begin within the next couple of months. Sorkin, best known for his writing on The West Wing and The Social Network, says Bale will have a lot of work to do on set, though he's confident in his abilities.\n\"He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined,\" he told Bloomberg. \"There isn\u2019t a scene or a frame that he\u2019s not in. So it\u2019s an extremely difficult part and he is gonna crush it.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
