{"Main text":"Keanu Reeves has definitely seen a ghost before\n\"It was in New York.

In the middle of the standard interview questions \u2014 what was Keanu's favorite movie to work on?

No one, except a second witness to the event whose terrified face confirmed that, yes, it was a ghost.\nBut Keanu's preface to the story is what ties it all together.
