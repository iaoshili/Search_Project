{"Main text":"'Dungeons & Dragons' will soon be free to try\nBasic game can be downloaded from the Wizards of the Coast website sometime in late July\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPen-and-paper role playing games  might not cost your soul , but they're not cheap to learn. Tabletop games publisher Wizards of the Coast is trying to make Dungeons & Dragons more accessible by releasing Basic D&D for free on or around July 15th alongside the Starter Set. While it won't share the same scope, the book is described as equivalent to the D&D Rules Cyclopedia, which collated the game's dizzying multitude of guidelines into one place. If this is correct, new players may well be able to start playing Dungeons & Dragons for only the cost of a set of dice.\nInitially, Basic D&D will only cover a handful of classes, the basic fantasy races, and enough material to create characters up to level 20. When Wizards of the Coast releases the Player's Handbook in August, it will be expanded to include monsters, magic items, rules for running a Dungeons & Dragons game, and directions on how to handle different environments. The company plans to continue releasing free PDFs as it publishes new storylines and books.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
