Wyoming became the first state to reject the new standards, which were devised by a coalition of experts and are completely voluntary, in early May, taking issue with their teaching of evolution and man-made global warming, according to the Associated Press .\nOne Oklahoma rep claimed climate change was still in debate by academics\nLast week, a House committee in Oklahoma also began a fight over the standard's confirmation by voting to reject them. Though the new standards were approved by the state's Department of Education, its legislature may now attempt to overturn that approval, according to KOCO Oklahoma City . Again, the legislators' issue appeared to be climate change.\n\"There\u2019s been a lot of recent criticisms, in some sectors, as to maybe some of the hyperbole \u2014 what some consider hyperbole \u2014 relative to climate change. I know it\u2019s a very very difficult, very very controversial subject,\" Oklahoma state Representative Mark McCullough, Republican, said before the vote rejecting what's known as the Next Generation Science Standards. He then asked the state board of education's science director whether the new standards might be used to \"inculcate\" young students with \"a fairly-one sided view as to that controversial subject [climate change], a subject that is very much in dispute even among even the academics.\"\nSo far 11 states have adopted the new standards, according to The New York Times . Two other states have also seen a heated debated around the them: Kentucky's legislature reportedly voted to reject the standards only to have its governor overrule it and mandate their implementation, and South Carolina has reportedly lightened the references to climate change and evolution in the standards, which are now moving through its legislature.\nThough climate change and evolution are being taught in some US schools, these standards \u2014 which were developed by the nonprofit Achieve with the support of 26 states \u2014 have created the first opportunity for them to be debated on a national scale . With 11 states supporting the standards so far, they're clearly seeing some success, even though they're sure to face a much steeper uphill battle elsewhere. That includes inside of the states that have already accepted them: beyond their approval, it'll still be up to local districts to actually implement the standards and teach what they've outlined.\n","Title":"States are fighting new science curriculum teaching climate change and evolution | The Verge","Tags":["policy","science"]}
