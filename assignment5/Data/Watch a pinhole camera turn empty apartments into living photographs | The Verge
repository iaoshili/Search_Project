{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe camera obscura is one of the simplest ways to reproduce imagery in the world, but a pair of French photographers are using its basic principles to turn entire apartments into canvases. Traditionally, a camera obscura is created by taking a light-proof box and making a pinhole in it; hence the term \"pinhole camera.\" Light enters the box through the hole, and recreates the image on the opposite wall, upside down. Romain Alary and Antoine Levi use the same technique , but with large physical spaces as their light-proof box instead \u2014 and then they film the result. It allows them to create dreamy, surreal montages where the physical textures of an apartment wall merge with the busy street outside in a kind of Inception-esque mash-up of reality and dream.\nThe duo collect their projects on their website , and have tried the technique in a number of different spaces \u2014 including on a boat . The project isn't finished, either; the pair say on their site that they're on the constant lookout for new locations to try the technique. If you think you have a location that you think would be particularly well-suited to the camera obscura treatment, you can reach them at their website \u2014 otherwise take a look at the videos and enjoy the ride.\n","Title":"Watch a pinhole camera turn empty apartments into living photographs | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","design"]}
