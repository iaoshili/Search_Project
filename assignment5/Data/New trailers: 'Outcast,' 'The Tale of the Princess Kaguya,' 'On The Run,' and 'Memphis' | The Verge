{"Main text":"10 Comments\nThe new Sin City hits theaters today and Terry Gilliam's The Zero Theorem debuted on-demand a few days ago, so you should have plenty to watch going into the weekend. There's also a lot to look forward to coming up ahead: we've rounded up new trailers for three movies and one TV special that are going to be worth keeping an eye on. Plus, there are two more excellent trailers beneath those that you'll want to watch if you missed them during the week.\nOutcast\nI could not have less of an idea as to what's happening in this trailer, but there\u2019s really only one thing that you need to know: it inexplicably stars Nicolas Cage as a guy named \"The White Ghost.\" So yeah. It\u2019ll be released next year on February 27th.\nThe Tale of the Princess Kaguya\nThis definitely doesn\u2019t look like the Studio Ghibli films that you\u2019re used to, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t look just as gorgeous. The film, from the director of Grave of the Fireflies, was released in Japan last year and will be playing in English starting October 17th.\nOn The Run\nPut September 20th on your calendar: Beyonc√© and Jay Z\u2019s huge tour is heading to HBO.\nMemphis\nMemphis doesn\u2019t look or sound like an easy film, dreamily sketching out the life of a singer (played by Willis Earl Beal) as he drifts around town. It\u2019s received some good reviews out of Sundance though, and it\u2019ll begin slowly rolling into theaters next month.\nAutomata\nThis has been a good year for sci-fi, and it looks like it's going to keep getting better. Automata comes out in October and has robots growing sentient and trying to escape from their human makers.\nMen, Women & Children\nYou're looking at a screen right now. And you probably spend a whole lot of your day looking at other screens too, even when there are people around. Juno director Jason Reitman's next film dives into that, taking a look at how our phones and laptops often know more about us than anyone else.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Outcast,' 'The Tale of the Princess Kaguya,' 'On The Run,' and 'Memphis' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
