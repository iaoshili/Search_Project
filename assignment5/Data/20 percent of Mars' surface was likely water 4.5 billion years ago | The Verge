{"Main text":"20 percent of Mars' surface was likely water 4.5 billion years ago\nThe body of water would have been larger than the Arctic Ocean\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMars once had enough water to cover its entire surface, a study published today in Science suggests . Around 4.5 billion years ago, Mars was host to a body of water that was larger than the Arctic Ocean. At around .085 miles deep, the water would have covered Mars' surface, but it's more likely the pool was slightly greater than one mile deep. In that case, it would have covered around 20 percent of the planet,  The Washington Post reports .\nMars also probably had seasons\nThe new findings come from a team of researchers who collected data via three large telescopes on Earth: the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Keck II telescope and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. The scientists measured the amount of water and the amount of HDO \u2014 water's heavier form \u2014 in Mars' atmosphere. The test was similar to measuring the separation of oil and water, one of the study's authors, Geronimo Villanueva, told The Washington Post. \"If you're losing material \u2014 which the atmosphere of Mars has been doing since it was formed \u2014 you'll lose more of the light material first,\" he said.\nBy measuring the ratio of H2O to HDO against their atmospheric rates of escape over nearly six years, the researchers were able to determine the planet's water content billions of years in the past. The research also indicates that Mars once contained several regional atmospheres and a climate divided into seasons.\nIt's not news that water once existed on Mars. In 2013, grooves and slopes in the planet's surface hinted at  recent water flow and last year, findings by NASA's Mars Curiosity rover suggested the planet's 96-mile-wide Gale Crater was  once the location of a massive lake . But today's findings suggest that Mars' water supply was  not fleeting . That Mars once hosted such a large body of water implies the planet may have been habitable for much longer than previously thought.\nNASA plans to evaluate these findings from space with the launch of an orbiter in 2016.\nVerge Video Archives: Can we colonize Mars?
