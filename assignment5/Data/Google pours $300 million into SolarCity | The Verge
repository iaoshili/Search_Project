{"Main text":"Google pours $300 million into SolarCity\nGoogle invested $280 million in SolarCity back in 2011\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle is investing $300 million in SolarCity to finance around 25,000 residential solar projects, the solar energy company announced today. SolarCity is the top residential solar system company in the US, but the industry is still in its infancy, and the upfront costs for a solar energy system aren't cheap. To remedy that, SolarCity will install solar panels on residential homes using the funding, and homeowners will pay a monthly fee to the company, instead of spending the well over $20,000 it can cost to have a solar system installed. First reported by  Reuters , SolarCity has created a $750 million fund for the projects, the largest ever for a residential solar system. Google previously invested $280 million in SolarCity \u2014 which is backed by Elon Musk, who is also the chairman \u2014 back in 2011. The company has invested over $1.5 billion in renewable energy projects, but this is its largest single investment to date.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
