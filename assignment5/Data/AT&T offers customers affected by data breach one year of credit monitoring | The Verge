{"Main text":"AT&T offers customers affected by data breach one year of credit monitoring\nStill no word on how many customers were affected\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast week, AT&T revealed that personal customer data was  exposed in a breach that occurred thanks to a service that unlocks phones for its customers. Now, the carrier is sending out letters to its customers confirming the hack \u2014 in a document  posted to the state of California's site , AT&T notes that one of its service providers \"violated our strict privacy and security guidelines by accessing your account without authorization.\" The breach took place between April 9th and 21st, and at that time the unnamed service provider was able to see customer social security numbers.\nAs is commonplace with security breaches like this (which are becoming more and more common), AT&T will be offering its customers one year of free credit monitoring to help mitigate any fraudulent activity or potential identity theft. The letter also reveals that AT&T is working with law enforcement to investigate the breach, another common activity after such information is released. We still don't know exactly how many accounts were accessed \u2014 but as noted when the breach first came to light, California law dictates that companies notify customers when they suffer from data breaches affecting more than 500 people.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
