{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is bringing its Halo spinoffs to iOS for the first time today. Both the new Halo: Spartan Strike and the  existing Halo: Spartan Assault are now available from Apple\u2019s App Store, priced at $5.99 each or $9.99 as a  bundle . Microsoft had originally planned to launch Spartan Strike exclusively on Windows and Windows Phone back in December, but the title was  mysteriously delayed before appearing today on iPhone, iPad,  Windows , and  Windows Phone . There's no signs that either title will be made available on Android or Amazon's Kindle devices.\nSpartan Strike is set in the Halo universe, with players taking on the role of a Spartan to fight against Covenant and Promethean enemies during the events of the Halo 2 era. Just like the original Spartan Assault mobile game, Spartan Strike is optimized for touch devices alongside small screens and even regular PCs. Microsoft\u2019s move to bring Halo to rival platforms alongside Windows and Windows Phone follows an increased focus at the company to ensure its software and services are available on iOS and Android. In a similar move, Amazon is  planning to bring its own titles to iOS , with four different games developed in-house set to debut on Apple devices soon. Both companies clearly want as many mobile gamers as possible to play their titles.\nVerge Video: Meet the new face of Halo\n","Title":"Microsoft brings Halo spinoffs to iPhone, iPad, and Windows | The Verge","Tags":["apple","microsoft","gaming","tech"]}
