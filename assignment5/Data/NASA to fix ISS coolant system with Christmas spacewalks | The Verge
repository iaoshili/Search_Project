Now  NASA has ordered a series of three spacewalks to repair the broken line. Two American astronauts \u2014 Rick Mastracchio and Michael Hopkins \u2014 will be leaving the confines of the ISS on Saturday, Monday, and Christmas Day, to replace a malfunctioning valve.\nThe timing of the spacewalks means that the scheduled launch of Orbital Sciences' Cygnus mission  has been delayed until  January 13th at the earliest . Cygnus \u2014 a cargo ship carrying supplies to the ISS \u2014 was set for this week, the ship using its  Antares rocket to blast off from Virginia before docking with the space station. NASA had originally hoped that the valve could  \"limp along\" until after Cygnus' arrival, but decided the best course of action was to fix the issue now in case of additional failures.\nNASA has hoped the broken cooling line could 'limp along'\nCygnus' late arrival might delay their Christmas presents, but Mastracchio says the astronauts are \"still very comfortable\" in the stricken space station, with lighting and sanitation systems still functional. The spacewalks are likely to be less comfortable for  veteran Mastracchio and first-timer Hopkins. Earlier this year, astronaut Luca Parmitano told the story of  how he almost drowned during such an exercise.\nAt least the time spent outside the space station will give Mastracchio \u2014 a who regularly  posts pictures taken from the space station on Twitter \u2014 an unobstructed view of our planet on Christmas Day. That should give him the best vantage point for spotting Santa, who the astronaut told the Associated Press he's  \"always on the lookout for.\"\n","Title":"NASA to fix ISS coolant system with Christmas spacewalks | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
