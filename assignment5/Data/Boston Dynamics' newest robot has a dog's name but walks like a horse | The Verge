{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBoston Dynamics, the robotics company  purchased by Google in 2013 , is best known  for BigDog , a quadrupedal robot designed to navigate rough terrain. Now BigDog has a baby brother.  Spot is a smaller Boston Dynamics creation \u2014 only 160 lbs to BigDog's 240 lbs \u2014 but it shares its sibling's four hydraulic legs, its sensor head, and its uncanny ability to stay upright as it climbs slopes and picks its way across uneven ground.\nSpot can keep its balance when kicked\nSpot has a dog's name, but walks more like a weird horse, picking its feet off the ground with dainty precision and keeping pace with running humans by adopting an equine canter. Being one of the smallest of Boston Dynamics' bunch, it seems that Spot gets picked on \u2014 its introductory video shows a number of staff members aiming kicks at their creation \u2014 but the robot's onboard sensors allow it to recover as quickly as it would if it tripped in the field, maintaining its balance with a hint of wounded pride.\nLighter than most of Boston Dynamics' bots, Spot handily beats the  much broader LS3 rough-terrain robot in a footrace, but it likely can't carry as much as its bigger brethren. What it loses as a beast of burden, Spot gains in practicality \u2014 its creators say it can be used indoors and out, and could eventually help with search and rescue, mapping, or accessing disaster zones.\n","Title":"Boston Dynamics' newest robot has a dog's name but walks like a horse | The Verge","Tags":["watch-this","tech"]}
