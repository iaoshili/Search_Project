{"Main text":"HBO will reportedly launch its standalone service in April alongside Game of Thrones\nIt's not TV \u2014 and it's not HBO Go\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe dream of  standalone HBO might be closer that we previously thought.  According to Fortune , the company plans to launch the service \"in line with the Game of Thrones season premiere in April.\"\nThere's also a pretty good chance the service will look a lot different than HBO Go. According to the report, HBO has canceled its in-house project (codenamed Maui) and instead will outsource the work to  MLB Advanced , which is used by MLB.com, the  WWE Network , and WatchESPN.\nWhy the change? According to one of Fortune's sources, \"they realized [CTO Otto Berkes] couldn't pull it off.\" HBO executives are reportedly unhappy with the frequent outages this year and the lack of upgrades.\nAs for what this all means for HBO Go in the long term is unclear. The memo that Fortune has provided makes it clear that the company's top priority is to \"fully support the work needed to enable the external solution for April\" but at the same time talks about repurposing \"a large portion of Maui's effort\" for Go (also in time for April).\nWe've reached out to HBO for comment.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
