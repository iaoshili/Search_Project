{"Main text":"'Final Fantasy' designer creates the wildest take on Batman yet\nTetsuya Nomura's Dark Knight is very, very dark\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf nothing else, Square Enix artist Tetsuya Nomura has built up a distinctive style over the years \u2014 his androgynous, zipper-heavy designs for characters in games like Kingdom Hearts and the Final Fantasy series are recognizable anywhere. But none of that will have prepared you for his surreal take on Batman, revealed in action figure form at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.\nThe \"DC Comics Variant Play Arts Action Figure\" looks more like something from Soul Calibur than the Caped Crusader, with bizarre talons on the back, dragonesque \"wings,\" and a helmet with giant red horns. No word on when or where this figure will be released, but it'd certainly make for an interesting conversation piece on anyone's coffee table.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
