{"Main text":"Science\nMaps reveal how climate change is poised to drown Louisiana\nRising seas and eroding grounds are poised to swamp southeastern part of the state and half of all US oil refineries, investigation reveals\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe fragile state of coastal Louisiana's defenses against rising seas were laid bare  nine years ago to the day , when  Hurricane Katrina made landfall in New Orleans. But the horrific damage to life and property caused by that storm pales in comparison to what is projected in the coming few years and decades: ProPublica and local New Orleans independent news site The Lens collaborated on a comprehensive and beautifully designed  investigative report revealing seas along the entire US coastline are poised to rise between 1.5 and 4.5 feet by 2100, while the coastline along Southeast Louisiana is on its own expected to experience a water level increase of 4 to 5 feet.\nThat would mean that most of the area known as \"the boot\" \u2014 which includes half of America's working oil refineries \u2014 would be underwater, a fact illustrated starkly by The Lens' and ProPublica's expert use of interactive, layered maps . And if you doubt the urgency of those projections or the reality of climate change, consider this: already, rising seas and eroding grounds have resulted in Louisiana losing 25 percent of its usable land (about 1,883 square miles) since 1930. It's honestly difficult to even conceive of the destruction that's in store unless drastic steps are taken to protect Louisiana's coastline. Read the full report from The Lens and ProPublica and just try not to be affected. And if that's not enough for you, take a look at the UN's latest report on climate change, which projects  more catastrophic effects around the world .\nThis story has been updated and corrected to cite The Lens.\n","Title":"Maps reveal how climate change is poised to drown Louisiana | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
