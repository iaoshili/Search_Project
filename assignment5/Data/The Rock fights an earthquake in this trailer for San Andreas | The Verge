We know the film will be of the fantasy genre, because in its universe Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, a man so muscular he can barely fit inside a compact car, will play the role of rescue helicopter pilot.\nAccording to the San Andreas plot summary, a magnitude 9 earthquake snaps the state of California like a saltine cracker. Amid the chaos, The Rock and his estranged wife must travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco to save their daughter, but don't think that means they're getting back together, okay!\nThe film has seven writer credits on IMDb, and no connection to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\nHere's Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson trying to suck up all of the planet's air.\nHere's a perfectly good microwave getting super-soaked.\nHere's a scrapped scene from Peter Pan Live !\nLatest\nHeadlines\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
