{"Main text":"This star-shaped yacht is perfect if you're a billionaire supervillain\nSTAR is a superyacht concept that will cost an estimated $500 million\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe've written about quite a few luxurious and expensive watercraft over the years here at The Verge, but none as flashy as this: the  STAR , a new concept for a superyacht measuring 433-feet long and nearly 200 feet high, was  announced last month by the BMT Group . The idea for the yacht was first sketched out by a Russian advertising executive on a napkin and then fleshed-out by industrial designer Igor Lobanov, according to BMT. The two rising stars wanted to create something that would stand out from the sea of comparatively bland and boring superyachts around now. \"Outside the marine industry, all yachts look the same: it seems that modern architecture, product design and car design have no influence on yachts,\" said Lobanov in a statement.\nNot only is the STAR gigantic, with 37,700-square-feet of interior space, eight decks, four elevators, a helipad and a daytime capacity of 200 guests, but it would shoot across the water at a relatively zippy 18 knots. It's being marketed as a private yacht or hotel, and will cost an estimated $500 million, as Lobanov told Business Insider . The creators of the STAR get points from me for their sheer audacity, but I can't help but fault their STAR for not being actually star-shaped. Instead it's more of a curved triangle, with a long, gently bowed hull. It's true that in particularly clear waters, the reflection of the top part of the yacht would create the illusion of a four-pointed star sailing through the sky. Before you get too starry-eyed or starstruck or hitch your wagon to this particular STAR, know this: the design is still a concept for now and is just being assessed for technical feasibility. So any multi-billionaires out there who are interested in picking one up might do well to take the advice advice of Jiminy Cricket for now.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"This star-shaped yacht is perfect if you're a billionaire supervillain | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design","transportation"]}
