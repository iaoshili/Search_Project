{"Main text":"5 Comments\nIf you\u2019ve been sitting around, anxiously waiting for somebody to make a nearly three-hour movie about robots and metallic dinosaurs, then this is the weekend for you. Transformers: Age of Extinction is hitting theaters, with Mark Wahlberg stepping in to take the franchise over from the recently-arrested Shia LaBeouf . Thankfully, there's also the long-awaited US release of director Bong Joon-ho's dystopian sci-fi train ride Snowpiercer to balance things out. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little less bombastic, don't worry \u2014Â there are a lot of other options on the way. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nThe Battered Bastards of Baseball\nNetflix\u2019s latest documentary focuses on the Portland Mavericks, an independent minor league baseball team that television actor Bing Russell managed in the 1970s. The club was made up of misfits, former professional players, and other actors \u2014 including Bing\u2019s own son, Kurt Russell. The documentary premiered at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, and will be debuting on Netflix on July 11th.\nFrank\nAnother film that garnered attention at Sundance this year was this quirky comedy that features Michael Fassbender as the titular Frank. He\u2019s a musician\u2026 who just happens to wear a giant fake head all the time. Domhnall Gleeson (About Time) and Maggie Gyllenhaal co-star.\nThe Purge: Anarchy\nIn the world of The Purge series, the United States has managed to rid itself of crime by dedicating one night a year to utter and complete lawlessness. The first entry focused on a single family hiding out in their home, but the sequel takes a look at  the violence in the streets \u2014 and one man who decides to bring order to the chaos.\nThe Prince\nJason Patric plays a reformed assassin trying to save his kidnapped daughter, while Bruce Willis is the crime lord looking to settle an old score. It\u2019s like Taken, but with the guys from Speed 2 and Striking Distance. There better be a boat chase in here somewhere.\nFury\nWe got an early sneak peek at this World War II drama a few weeks back, and now the first trailer has arrived. Brad Pitt plays Wardaddy, an army sergeant that leads a team of men and a Sherman tank into Germany in World War II. David Ayer (End of Watch, Training Day) writes and directs.\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018Frank,\u2019 \u2018Fury,\u2019 \u2018The Prince,\u2019 and \u2018The Battered Bastards of Baseball\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
