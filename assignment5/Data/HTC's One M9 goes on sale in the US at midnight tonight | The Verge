{"Main text":"HTC's One M9 goes on sale in the US at midnight tonight\n$649 unlocked or take your pick from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe HTC One M9 will be available in stores across the United States from April 10th, but you can get one a little bit earlier by placing an order directly with HTC from midnight tonight. The Taiwanese company has priced its new flagship smartphone at $649 unlocked with 32GB of storage, matching the price of the 16GB iPhone 6. Carrier-specific variants will also be available from HTC.com on Friday, with all the big US operators supporting the new One: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon will all get a version of the device.\nTo make its phone stand out from a crowded and highly competitive market, HTC is bundling what it calls  Uh Oh Protection , essentially a free one-year insurance for the phone. If your One M9 suffers water damage or a cracked screen, or if you want to switch to a different carrier, HTC will replace it with an equivalent device for free. Should you not need to use this service within its one year of validity, HTC will give you a $100 credit toward the purchase of another One handset. This extra peace of mind, more than  the relatively unchanged design and performance of the new phone, is what makes the One M9 worth considering ahead of its peers.\n","Title":"HTC's One M9 goes on sale in the US at midnight tonight | The Verge","Tags":["google","mobile","tech"]}
