{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSnapchat's new Discover feature is barely a week old , but it just got the platform's first big exclusive: Madonna's first music video from her new album just premiered on the company's own Discover channel. The video is directed by the French duo J.A.C.K. , who have made commercials for brands like Converse and IKEA. It will be for the song \"Living for Love,\" the first single for the album Rebel Heart which was actually leaked before it was even announced back in December.\nUsers can just swipe up from this panel to watch.\nAs with all content on Discover, users will have 24 hours to watch the video until Snapchat replaces it with new content tomorrow. Madonna isn't the first artist to have her music videos ephemerally published on the service, though. In its first week, both Warner Music and VICE have been using Discover to showcase the music videos of new and featured artists. But it's interesting that Snapchat will start featuring artists in its own Discover channel considering what we found last year about the company's interest in the music industry.\nEmails leaked during the Sony hack showed that Snapchat's CEO Evan Spiegel had been working on partnering with companies in the music industry for a big part of 2014 . The proposed ideas ranged from starting a  label to using the app to cover up-and-coming acts. Talks apparently stalled because many music executives were concerned about the ability to make money on the platform.\nUpdate February 5th, 2:45PM ET: This post has been updated to reflect that the video is now live.\n","Title":"Madonna just premiered a new music video on Snapchat | The Verge","Tags":["apps","entertainment","tech"]}
