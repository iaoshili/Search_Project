But so far it has only dabbled at building a business around that traffic, with a few small tests of promoted posts created by advertisers. Today it's announcing the hire of Steve Patrizi as its VP of market development, and the company hopes to start rolling out a steady stream of native ads on Imgur some time in the first half of 2015.\nPatrizi previously worked on exactly this kind of advertising at LinkedIn and Pinterest, so he understands the challenges of making a match between a startup's community of users and the brands who would pay to reach them. \"We have seen an evolution of Imgur from an straight image posting service to now almost a visual storytelling community.
