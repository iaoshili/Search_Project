That's especially true if you're the director of the  upcoming all-female Ghostbusters film (which, as of this week, will now be followed  by an all-male Ghostbusters ).\nPaul Feig, whose other work includes Bridesmaids and the new action comedy Spy,  told Variety that \"the biggest thing I've heard for the last four months is, \u2018Thanks for ruining my childhood'... It's so dramatic. Honestly, the only way I could ruin your childhood is if I got into a time machine and went back and made you an orphan.\"\n\u2014 Paul Feig (@paulfeig) January 27, 2015\nThe perennially suited filmmaker described the internet's reaction as two waves \u2014 the first being overwhelmingly positive and the second being \"some of the most vile, misogynistic shit I've ever seen in my life.\"\nAs for the all-dude Ghostbusters, which is reportedly part of new Ghostbusters cinematic universe à la Marvel, Feig says he is not involved but is a fan of actor Channing Tatum and directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who are all attached to the project. \"Who knew there were so many ghosts to be busted in the world?\"\nFeig's Ghostbusters \u2014  \"inspired\" by The Walking Dead and starring starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones \u2014 will hit theaters July 22nd, 2016.\n","Title":"The director of the all-female Ghostbusters has the best response to internet trolls | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
