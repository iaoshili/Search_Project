Not yet . The shortage of connection options on the new MacBook is by design \u2014 as Apple is looking to move into a truly wireless future \u2014 but the frustration felt by those of us still stuck with wired peripherals surely isn't. To alleviate that pain, there's  a new Kickstarter project that offers the simplest of solutions: a pass-through USB-C connector that lets you chain together a bunch of external devices while still keeping the MacBook's sole USB port open. Importantly, though, Apple uses the same jack for powering the MacBook, which this InfiniteUSB-C attachment doesn't support.\nThe InfiniteUSB-C is actually a modernized update of a 2010 concept called InfiniteUSB, which did exactly what the present cables do but with the old USB connector. While that was  a really cool idea at the time, it seems like a necessary accessory today. The present Kickstarter campaign is intended to bring both designs to market. Besides Apple's MacBook, Google's newly updated Chromebook Pixel also stands to benefit from the USB-C expansion on offer here. You can see the conventional InfiniteUSB cable below and more details about how to get your own over on  the InfiniteUSB website .\nVerge Video: The reversible USB plug of the future\n","Title":"Kickstarter nearly solves the new MacBook's USB issue | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
