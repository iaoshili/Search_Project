{"Main text":"Addicted to Destiny? Give Monster Hunter a shot\nJapan's biggest action game series returns to the US today\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDestiny may have been last year\u2019s biggest game launch, but it was also by far the most divisive. For everyone that got sucked in by its compulsive blend of Halo-style shooting with RPG levelling \u2014 count me among them \u2014 there were others that found the experience a huge letdown. Review after review criticized Destiny for its threadbare story, repeating environments, overpowered \u201Cbullet-sponge\u201D bosses, and, above all, the need to grind obsessively to level up your character.\n\u201CWhat\u2019s with these reviewers?\u201D I thought to myself. \u201CIt\u2019s like they\u2019re not into Monster Hunter.\u201D\nWell, that\u2019s the thing \u2014 if you\u2019re in the West, you probably aren\u2019t into Monster Hunter. But Capcom\u2019s action RPG series \u2014 informally known as \"MonHun,\" just as Pocket Monsters became Pokémon \u2014 is a huge deal in Japan, drawing millions of fans both casual and hardcore. Today sees the North American release of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the 3DS, representing the first truly new MonHun game to hit the US in five years. Just like Destiny, it\u2019s not for everyone. But if Destiny is for you, Monster Hunter just might be, too.\nI am contractually obliged to explain to you that Monster Hunter is, of course, about hunting monsters. But it\u2019s not about hunting monsters in the way that Call of Duty is about answering the call of duty by shooting terrorists, saving the world, and watching Kevin Spacey seethe his way through cutscenes. It is really, truly, exclusively about hunting monsters. When you hunt a monster, you can carve it up for parts that you can later turn into armor. When you wear the monster\u2019s armor, you become stronger, and maybe you can hunt a bigger monster the next time. And so on.\nOn the surface, Monster Hunter doesn\u2019t have much in common with Destiny. Bungie\u2019s game is a beautiful sci-fi first-person shooter at home on powerful consoles like the PS4, but Monster Hunter is a fantasy third-person action game where every entry in the series has initially been released on hardware roughly as powerful as the PS2. Although the art style is original and accomplished, particularly when it comes to the monsters, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate doesn\u2019t look great even for a 3DS game.\nAnd, while Destiny is instantly satisfying thanks to the clear presence of  Halo DNA in its combat, Monster Hunter is initially pretty tough and inaccessible. Don\u2019t expect it to have anything in common with fast-paced Capcom action games like Devil May Cry; Monster Hunter\u2019s slow pace is closer to something like the infamously intimidating Dark Souls. You can wield a massive sword right from the start of the game, but learning to use it is another matter. Animations are often long, and can\u2019t be canceled; each swing has to be well-timed when battling the more dangerous monsters, or you\u2019ll leave yourself wide open. Other weapon classes exist, each with their own set of tradeoffs to master. Enemies will never simply drop new weapons or armor as they do in Destiny \u2014 only some of the ingredients necessary to craft them.\nBut where the two games converge is in their structure and overall goals. There is almost zero story in Monster Hunter. It makes Destiny look like Anna Karenina. You\u2019re largely free to hunt monsters in whatever order you like, though success in one set of missions will open up the next rank. Beyond the introductory stages, the freeform structure of the game means you can spend your time the way you want. Like Destiny, you\u2019ll often find yourself visiting the same few areas hoping to find certain items to help you craft or upgrade that next piece of armor. Some call this \"grinding,\" a term usually associated with brute-forcing dull RPG battles in order to level up your character. But when Destiny and Monster Hunter are so much fun on a minute-to-minute level, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as you\u2019re invested in your character\u2019s progression.\nOnce it clicks, Monster Hunter is brilliant, raucous fun, especially with friends. The series really took off in Japan when Capcom pivoted the series to concentrate on the PSP; it was near-impossible to walk onto a train carriage in Japan between 2008 and 2012 without seeing men, women, and children transfixed by Sony\u2019s little plastic handheld. Many went so far as to contort their fingers into a \"claw\" to manipulate the awkward camera controls (thankfully a non-issue on the New 3DS and New 3DS XL , with their extra analog nubs). And the combination of portability and local multiplayer was key to Monster Hunter\u2019s success. The four-player co-operative hunts became a thing I\u2019d do when hanging out normally; I literally used to go to bars to play Monster Hunter with friends and strangers. When you\u2019re all sitting around a table trying to take down a gigantic monster, you end up developing complex strategies. You ask your friends how they got their crazy armor. You help each other level up so you can go on harder quests together. And, while you're doing all this, you talk about the things that friends talk about.\nI maintain that local multiplayer is the canonical way to play Monster Hunter. But Capcom\u2019s continuing focus on that feature at the expense of online support was, I believe, a big reason why the series never took off in the US \u2014 people just don\u2019t play handheld consoles in public as much as they do in Japan. Fortunately, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is the first portable Monster Hunter game to be released in the West with an online mode, so you can have the best of both worlds.\nMonster Hunter doesn\u2019t make it as easy to play with other people as Destiny, however. The online and offline modes are separate, so you have to make a decision as to what you want to do before heading in. Destiny, on the other hand, is constantly online and does a great job of making levels feel like a living world. I\u2019ve never consciously attempted to play with my friends before, but it happens all the time when we both bump into each other online. And, although Bungie doesn\u2019t do a great job of explaining how best to progress, Destiny\u2019s interface is a huge improvement on Monster Hunter\u2019s, which feels like a relic from the PS2 era.\nI\u2019d be very surprised if Destiny wasn't influenced by Monster Hunter\nDestiny has its issues, too \u2014 its story missions are beyond perfunctory, its endgame isn't fleshed out enough, and it\u2019s understandable for players to wonder what happened to the expansive sci-fi universe promised years ago. But I\u2019d be very surprised if Bungie didn't take inspiration from Monster Hunter, and if many of Destiny\u2019s supposed flaws weren\u2019t deliberate design decisions made to help create a sticky, replayable game that will keep the faithful hooked for years. To me, its lack of plot and exposition is a great thing \u2014 the Halo series shows what happens when Bungie tries to create an epic saga. Given the nonsensical slivers of story that are actually in Destiny, I only wish it were as minimalist as Monster Hunter.\nIn Japan, Monster Hunter\u2019s loose structure is considered accessible and friendly; in the West, Destiny has been pilloried for making players revisit levels for different missions in the exact same fashion. I\u2019m not saying either position is right or wrong, but I do think the wild hype poured upon Destiny ahead of release set expectations out of whack for what was always going to be an unconventional game. I ended up loving Destiny, and I love it for the exact same reasons I\u2019ve loved Monster Hunter for years: the basic action is rewarding and deep, and the progression system is addictive in all the right ways. If you think you might feel the same, go hunt some monsters on your 3DS today.\n","Title":"Addicted to Destiny?
