{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis week, the Wellcome Trust \u2014 a UK-based biomedical research charity \u2014 announced the 2015 finalists for their annual photography competition . The 20 images span a range of disciplines and imaging techniques, from a simple photograph of an elderly woman with a curved spine, to a composite image of a boll weevil taken with a scanning electron microscope.\n\"The breath-taking riches of the imagery that science generates are so important in telling stories about research and helping us to understand often abstract concepts,\" said Adam Rutherford, a scientists and judge for the Wellcome Image Awards, in an  accompanying press release . \"It\u2019s not just about imaging the very small either. It\u2019s about understanding life, death, sex, and disease: the cornerstones of drama and art.\"\n\"IT\u2019S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING LIFE, DEATH, SEX AND DISEASE.\"\nAll of these elements are certainly present in this year's line-up, with images of skeletons \u2014 both 3D-printed and computer generated \u2014 as well cells, nerves, models, and body parts. There's pictures of animals like the tiny parasitic wasp just 0.75 millimeters in length, and of creatures not yet fully formed, such as the five-month fetus of an unborn horse, still enveloped in the cloud-like swirl of a uterus.\nThe winning images from the competition will be announced later this month on March 20th, with the whole collection then displayed across the UK and in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Koch Institute and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.\nAll images credited to Wellcome Images.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThis confocal micrograph shows the nerves in a cross-section of an adult mouse's brain.
