{"Main text":"Why VR could be the next big thing in porn\nVirtual reality may still be getting off the ground, but the adult entertainment industry is already exploring how it can be used for porn. If you're wondering what that'll look like, here's the answer \u2014 or, at least, what the industry has figured out so far.\nThe Awl\nJohn Herrman discusses Facebook\u2019s lofty ambitions to host native content from journalists.\nThat the New York Times and BuzzFeed are said to be participating in this program speaks to its appeal. BuzzFeed is growing fast and charges a lot of money for sponsored content; the Times has a paid subscriber base and a favorable relationship with advertisers, at least compared to much of the online publishing world, which is facing harrowing declines in advertising rates. BuzzFeed and the Times are making their decisions from positions of relative comfort and security. If Facebook publishing is attractive to healthy companies, imagine how appealing it will be to dying ones.\nHillary's Nerd Squad\nPolitico\nDarren Samuelsohn reports on Hillary Clinton\u2019s attempt to up her tech game for the 2016 presidential election.\nThere\u2019s still no guarantee Clinton\u2019s newly-assembled tech team will gel \u2014 or that for all the gadgets and innovations her campaign creates, she\u2019ll be able to gain the same advantage as Obama. But the new additions, confirmed by multiple Democratic sources and coming before the expected official campaign announcement in April, suggest Clinton will enter the race equipped with essential tools for modern-day presidential campaigning.\nThe deadly global war for sand\nWired\nVince Beiser examines how the lucrative sand mining industry creates an environment ripe for gangs and the black market.\nThough the supply might seem endless, sand is a finite resource like any other. The worldwide construction boom of recent years\u2014all those mushrooming megacities, from Lagos to Beijing\u2014is devouring unprecedented quantities; extracting it is a $70 billion industry. In Dubai enormous land-reclamation projects and breakneck skyscraper-building have exhausted all the nearby sources. Exporters in Australia are literally selling sand to Arabs.

But where there is a rule, there is often a workaround. At Pelican Bay State Prison in Northern California, inmates have yelled to one another through drainpipes under their cells; inmates in Texas talk through cans connected with twine; and in facilities throughout the country, little paper notes \u2014 known as \"kites\" \u2014 are literally handed off. As technology has developed, so have the communication methods; cell phones and iPods are regularly smuggled to inmates by visitors and guards. And occasionally, the technology is already inside the prison. Some inmates have learned how to transform their radios into devices that allow them to talk to each other and even eavesdrop on guards.\nListen to this\n","Title":"The Weekender: Hangovers, The Terminator, and George R.R.
