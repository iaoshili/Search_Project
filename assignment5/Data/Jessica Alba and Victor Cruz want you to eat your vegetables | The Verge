{"Main text":"Jessica Alba and Victor Cruz want you to eat your vegetables\nA new marketing campaign attempts to rebrand fresh produce\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLast year, we laughed when a fake Silicon Valley startup released a  shiny, branded commercial for carrots . Now it looks like that parody is about to become a reality. Partnership for a Healthier America and Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative will attempt to rebrand fruits and vegetables with a new marketing campaign, the Associated Press reports .\nThe campaign, which launched today, is calling itself  FNV \u2014 a \"hip\" acronym for \"fruits 'n' vegetables.\" AP reports that while FNV will have  its own website , the campaign will function primarily on social media. Its  YouTube and Twitter accounts will feature videos like the one above, where celebrities like Jessica Alba and NFL wide receiver Victor Cruz champion the benefits of eating fresh produce.\nFNV is a cool kid's fruits and vegetables\nPartnership for a Healthier America has recruited the marketing company Victors and Spoils, whose client list includes Smirnoff, Adidas, and Coca-Cola, to helm the campaign.\n\"Obviously, our inspiration for all this was behaving like a big, iconic brand,\" Andrew Nathan, chief marketing director at Victors and Spoils, told the AP. Corporate food companies and their persistent branding has  a real influence on young people's diets , and FNV plans to mimic those advertising tactics to convince its audience that fruits and vegetables are just as cool as fast food.\nIn the words of an animated teaser on the FNV website, \"Fruits and vegetables are now a brand.\"\n","Title":"Jessica Alba and Victor Cruz want you to eat your vegetables | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","science"]}
