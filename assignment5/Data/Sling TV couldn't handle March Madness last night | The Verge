{"Main text":"Sling TV couldn't handle March Madness last night\nThe web tv service issued an apology after the games\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOne of Sling TV's biggest selling points was that it offered ESPN and Turner Sports in its  $20 per month web TV bundle , and last night, the service failed during one of the most-watched sporting events of the year: the March Madness semi-finals. The Duke vs. Michigan State and Wisconsin vs. Kentucky games brought in a surge of viewers all at once, and for some people trying to watch Turner's broadcast, Sling just stopped working.\nHad high hopes for @Sling TV, but it was completely crappy for this basketball game. Shame, shame.\n\u2014 KoR x BdLckKd (@bdlckkd) April 5, 2015\n#slingtv is a major fail for NCAA finals\n\u2014 Kendal Killian (@KendalKillian) April 5, 2015\nSling's service cut in and out throughout the games, if it worked at all, Recode reports . The errors suggest Sling wasn't expecting such a large number of Final Four viewers, but it definitely should have. The service reportedly had  100,000 sign-ups in its first month , and March Madness is a hugely popular, billion-dollar event. In 2014, the NCAA semi-finals were the  most-viewed college sports event in cable TV history, and this year was no different. Including conventional TV viewership, last night's Wisconsin\/Kentucky game was the most-viewed Final Four game in the last 22 years, Recode reports.\nWe're sorry some basketball fans saw errors tonight due to extreme sign-ups and streaming. Engineers rebalanced load across network partners\n\u2014 Sling Answers (@slinganswers) April 5, 2015\nSling apologized for the errors on Twitter, but this is a common problem with internet television. Despite the  growing popularity of cord-cutting , web TV is still often unstable and unpredictable, especially when it comes to big live events. ABC's recent livestream of The Oscars kept cutting to a screening of The Social Network and episodes of Jeopardy .\nIn spite of its problems, web television still seems to be the inevitable future of TV. Apple is reportedly in talks to build  its own internet TV service and HBO plans to launch a  standalone HBO Go subscription later this year. Longtime cable users making the switch will have to get used to bandwidth problems and router issues that still come with the territory.\n","Title":"Sling TV couldn't handle March Madness last night | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tech"]}
