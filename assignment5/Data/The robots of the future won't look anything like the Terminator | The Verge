{"Main text":"60 Comments\nAndy Marchese has a lot of fish tanks but no fish food \u2014 his fish prefer batteries and compressed air. On a recent Monday, Marchese conducted an out-of-water demonstration of Bubbles, a pool-green silicone fish that sways its tail as cavities on each side of its body alternately inflate, creating a perfect imitation of a carp. It is the first autonomous, self-contained robot made mostly of soft parts .\nRoboticists are prejudiced toward rigid structures, for which algorithms can be inherited from the well-established factory robot industry. Soft robots solve two huge problems with current robots, however. They don\u2019t have to calculate their movements as precisely as hard robots, which rely on springs and joints, making them better for navigating uncontrolled environments like a house, disaster area, or hospital room. They\u2019re naturally \u201Ccage free,\u201D meaning they can work shoulder-to-shoulder with humans. If a soft robot tips over or malfunctions, the danger is on par with being attacked by a pillow. The robot is also less prone to hurt itself .\nThe Bubbles demonstration was a rare glimpse into MIT\u2019s elite Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), the lab that bred graduates who produced the World Wide Web and public key encryption. CSAIL is working on all kinds of robots, but a confluence of key technologies such as 3D printing has inspired scientists from biology, materials science, robotics, and other disciplines to work on a reinterpretation of the robot that looks looks less like C-3PO and more like, say, a squid.\nThe field of soft robotics has attracted a rush of attention in the last year. Down the road at Harvard, multiple groups are working on soft robotic hands, jumping legs, exosuits , and quadrupeds that can do the limbo . At Worcester Polytechnic Institute'sÂ  Soft Robotics Lab , researchers are building a snake. In San Francisco, a startup called Otherlab is building inflatable robots that can shake hands, walk, and carry riders. In Italy, a group of researchers built a robotic tentacle modeled after an octopus .\nBefore the 1970s, car companies made cars safer by making them larger and heavier. Then along came the airbag: a lightweight safety device that folded up invisibly into the vehicle until it sensed a crash. Similar revolutions took place with body armor, bridges, and contact lenses, and these researchers believe something similar is happening with robots.\n\"It\u2019s not a part of conventional robotics technologies.\"\nAbove: Traditional hard robot hand design.\nBelow: Soft elastomer robot hand design.\n\"It\u2019s not a part of conventional robotics technologies,\" says Fumiya Iida, a professor of bio-inspired robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology-Zurich and a member of the IEEE committee on soft robotics . \"They have to think completely differently, use different materials, different energy sources. Definitely this is the way we should go in the long run.\" One of the most impressive rigid robots in the world right now is Boston Dynamics\u2019 300-pound humanoid Atlas . If Atlas wants to pick up a ball, it needs to sense and compute the precise distance between its digits and the ball and figure out exactly where to place its hand and how much pressure to apply.\nRobots like Atlas \"are doing a lot of thinking,\" says Barry Trimmer, PhD, a professor at Tufts and the editor of a new journal, Soft Robotics, which launched last month . \"There\u2019s a lot of hesitancy. \u2018Where do I put my foot next?\u2019 Animals just don't do that. We need to get away from the idea that you have to control every variable.\"\nBy contrast, Harvard\u2019s starfish-shaped soft gripper only needs to be told to inflate. As it\u2019s pumped full of air, it conforms to the shape of an object until its \"fingers\" have enough pressure to lift it. Another example would be a human picking up a glass of water. We don\u2019t have to compute the exact size and shape of the glass with our brains; our hand adapts to the object. Similarly, Bubbles doesn\u2019t calculate the full length of its movement. \"It doesn\u2019t know where its tail is all the time,\" Marchese says.\nThe effort and funding going into soft robotics is miniscule compared to what\u2019s been invested in hard robots, says Saul Griffith, the founder of Otherlab, which recently spun out a soft robotics-focused startup called Pneubotics.\n\"We are exceptionally early in soft robotics as a field,\" he says in an email. \"There is more hype than substance ... there are only maybe three or four interesting demonstrations of unique function and capacity. With those things said, the flexibility, potential low cost, and good match with human scale tasks makes soft robots very attractive.\"\nThere are technological challenges as well. In addition to air and fluid pressure actuators, soft roboticists are experimenting with dielectric elastomers, elastic materials that expand and contract in response to electric voltage; shape-memory alloys, metal alloys that can be programmed to change shape at certain temperatures ; and springs that respond to light . These approaches are still rudimentary, as are the control systems that operate the robots (in the case of many of Harvard\u2019s soft robots, it\u2019s simply a syringe of air attached to a tube).\nSoft robots could be used in space, medicine, and maybe one day, human wings\nThe field is so new, however, that no possibilities have yet been ruled out. Soft robotics technologies could theoretically be used in a wearable pair of human wings. More practically, soft robots could easily pack eggs or pick fruit \u2014 traditional hard robots, equipped with superhuman grips, are more likely to break yolks and inadvertently make applesauce. A mass of wormlike \" meshworm \" robots could be filled with water and dropped over a disaster area, where they would crawl to survivors. A soft robotic sleeve could be worn to eliminate tremors or supplement strength lost with age. Soft robots could be used in space exploration, where weight is hugely important; in prosthetics, where they would provide comfort and lifelikeness; in the home, where they can help out around the house without trampling the dog; and in surgical robots, where operators have inspired a few lawsuits after puncturing patients\u2019 insides.\nTrimmer even imagines a day when soft robots will be built with lab-grown muscle tissue powered by stores of fat. He believes robotics is truly at the beginning of a paradigm shift. \"If this is successful, there won\u2019t really be a field of soft robotics,\" he says. \"Robotics in general will incorporate all of that technology and that approach. There will be predominantly soft robots.\"\nLead image of soft robotic snake courtesy WPI .\n","Title":"The robots of the future won't look anything like the Terminator | The Verge","Tags":["report","science","tech"]}
