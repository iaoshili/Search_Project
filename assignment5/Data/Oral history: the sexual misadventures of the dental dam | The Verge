{"Main text":"185 Comments\nWere it not for the three queer women who accosted him at a sexual health conference in Canberra, Australia, Clive Woodworth likely wouldn\u2019t remember the 1993 conference at all. As the founder and CEO of Glyde Health , Woodworth attended these events to promote the company\u2019s safe-sex products; because this conference was geared toward empowering women, it was an ideal forum to promulgate the company\u2019s newly coined condom slogan: \u201CIf it ain\u2019t on, it ain\u2019t on.\u201D But when the women approached Woodworth with a special request, the gathering suddenly took on a bigger meaning. Because, according to him, it marked the moment the dental dam was reborn.\nOriginally devised for use during dental procedures, the dams are used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) acquired through vaginal or anal licking. And even though most adults are aware of the dam\u2019s existence \u2014 especially queer women, to whom the products are aggressively marketed \u2014 mentioning this particular latex product is more likely to elicit squirming or lewd comments than its penile counterpart, the condom.\nThat awkwardness may be linked to the apparent unpopularity of the product. A 2010 Australian study of 330 women, for example, states that 9.7 percent of queer women \u2014 defined as women who have sex with women \u2014 use dental dams during oral sex, and only 2.1 percent do so regularly. And research on dam use among heterosexuals and gay men (trans- and cisgender alike) is practically non-existent, which is either an indication of the dam\u2019s unpopularity, or its inability to attract the attention of scientists and funding agencies.\n\u201CTheir concerns were that there was nothing for women, particularly for lesbian woman who wanted to perform sexual acts on each other,\u201D Woodworth recalls of the 1993 trio, \u201Cother than cut-up condoms, or what you Americans refer to as \u2018Saran wrap.\u2019\u201D They were also dissatisfied substituting with dams that dentists used, because they were \u201Ctoo small, too thick, and not very sensual.\u201D These women, Woodworth says, were \u201Cunderstandably annoyed.\u201D\nAfter the encounter, Woodworth set out to design a better dental dam, one larger and thinner than those used by dentists. In 1994, the first Sheer Glyde Dams hit the Australian market \u2014 one year before Line One Laboratories , a US-based condom company, completed its own version. \u201CI went to the dentist and he put a dental dam into my mouth,\u201D says Budiman Lee, founder of Line One Laboratories. \u201CAnd because I had been making condoms since 1990, I thought you could come up with a bigger condom shape and cut it into a square\u201D that could be used for oral sex.\nLee\u2019s experience points to an important fact: the dam was never intended to be used during oral sex. Originally invented by Sanford Barnum in 1864 , the \"rubber dam\" was built to isolate a tooth from the rest of the oral cavity. But that didn\u2019t stop people from co-opting the device for oral sex more than a century later, during the HIV epidemic of the 1980s. During that period, the New York Times made brief mention of dental dams for oral sex in an article called \" Women and AIDS: Discussing Precautions. \" Two decades later, the paper of record referred to the product as the \" unimaginably awkward dental dam. \"\nClearly, redesigning the dental dam specifically for oral sex hasn\u2019t done much for the product\u2019s image. In New York, it\u2019s rarely mentioned by patients at Planned Parenthood: requests for dental dams occur about five times a month, says spokesperson Adrienne Verrilli, compared to the almost daily requests for condoms. Even queer women seem to prefer cheerleading the dam\u2019s existence to actually purchasing it. \"We started distributing dental dams in 2003 at places like parties,\" says Annaliese Constable, a coordinator for the Lesbian and Same-Sex Attracted Women\u2019s Sexual Health Project at ACON , an Australian health organization. But it soon became clear that \"the dams were not being used.\" So, in 2006, after spending about $1,500 a year to buy 3,000 dental dams, the project stopped including them in safe-sex packs.\nToday, the project distributes a mere 400 dams each year. Women ask coordinators about dams, Constable says, but seldom take them home. \"They just want to know there is a service that has something for them and represents them,\" she says, even if they don\u2019t actually want to use the product.\nredesigning the dental dam hasn't done much for the product's image\nYet of all examples of the dam\u2019s meager acceptance, its use in Australian women\u2019s prisons might be the most telling. In a rare instance, prisons in New South Wales started stocking dental dams after a local court ruled that men\u2019s prisons had to be supplied with condoms. But a study found that only 4 percent of incarcerated women use the dams during oral sex with other inmates. \"Women use them as little mats in their rooms,\" says Juliet Richters, a sexual health researcher at the University of New South Wales and co-author of the study. \"They are having no effect in terms of prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\"\nIf women who are incarcerated don\u2019t use them, and Planned Parenthood can\u2019t give them away for free, then it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that major US drugstores don\u2019t carry dental dams at all. But that doesn\u2019t mean dam companies haven\u2019t tried: in 1998, Glyde\u2019s US representative, Barbara Lippert, pitched the dams to multiple companies, including CVS and Walgreens. \"The drugstores won\u2019t pick \u2018em up and that\u2019s really the shame of it,\" she says. Lippert recalls one representative saying \"never in his lifetime\" in reaction to stocking the dams, while another said \"they can cut up a condom if they want.\u2019\" She sent him a box of condoms and a pair of scissors in response, along with a note saying \"you try it.\"\nRepresentatives from CVS and Walgreens couldn\u2019t confirm these 1998 interactions, but Phil Caruso, a representative at Walgreens, said that \"at this time, we do not carry the Sheer Glyde Dam throughout our chain,\" and that the decision is \"based on a number of factors including customer demand.\"\nDemand might be low because medical experts still aren\u2019t sure how well the dams actually work. \"Usually when people start doing promotion for a health-prevention product, it\u2019s because there is something to prevent,\" Richters says. But there have been few reported cases of female-to-female transmission of HIV \u2014 the latest of which was announced by the CDC last week \u2014 meaning there isn\u2019t much \"evidence of need\" for queer women.\nOf course, a number of STIs can be acquired through oral sex, including herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), and gonorrhea. But because dental dams are marketed largely to queer women, Richters says, researchers have failed to look at its effectiveness as a safe-sex barrier. The threat posed by these STIs, in this population, simply isn\u2019t high enough to prompt a thorough investigation. Even Richters questions whether the dental dam is actually worth the trouble. \"Why you would use dental dams instead of cling wrap is unclear to me.\"\nAlthough the Sheer Glyde Dam has never undergone a controlled clinical trial, it was submitted to several tests before being sold in the US. According to Morgan Liscinsky, an FDA spokesperson, these tests included biocompatibility along with mechanical and viral penetration studies. But none of these were done with human subjects, largely because dental dams were able to piggyback off of the condom\u2019s previous approval to gain FDA clearance. Currently, the FDA\u2019s position on dental dams is that although they \"may help prevent the transmission of STIs\" when used correctly, \"they do not eliminate the risk.\"\n\"why you would use dental dams instead of cling wrap is unclear to me.\"\nThe FDA\u2019s uncertainty hints at the difficulties inherent in studying a product designed for oral sex. For an experiment to work, Richters explains, you would need a very large number of monogamous couples in which one partner has an STI. These couples would also need to limit their sexual activities to oral sex alone for long periods. Richters also blames a lack of funding for the insufficient knowledge regarding the risks of STI transmission between queer women. \"It\u2019s hard to get grant money when people don\u2019t die of being lesbians,\" she says.\nAccording to Lee and Woodworth, the dental dam business is increasingly lucrative. Line One Laboratories is selling up to 300,000 dams a month, Lee says, while Woodworth notes that Glyde sells close to 100,000. Moreover, Woodworth says that the dams are now entering new markets. \"We just shipped 460,000 dams to El Salvador,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a staunchly Catholic country, so it\u2019s pretty surprising.\"\nOther data isn\u2019t so promising. At notorious New York sex shop Babeland, dental dams represent only 2 percent of the store\u2019s 2013 safe-sex inventory, according to co-founder Claire Cavanah. The company currently sells them for $1.75 each \u2014 more than twice the price of a single condom in their online store. And many sex shops don\u2019t stock dams at all.\ndental dams do serve a purpose, albeit one more symbolic than practical.\nIf Glyde really was the first company to produce a sex-specific dental dam, then the latex square is turning 20 this year. So despite its limited availability, image problem, and unknown effectiveness, the dam probably isn\u2019t going anywhere.\nAnd that may be a good thing. According to some, dental dams do serve a clear purpose, albeit one more symbolic than practical: they give queer women something of their own in a world that tends to dismiss their sexual health. All too often, says ACON coordinator Constable, services aren\u2019t adequately informed to deal with lesbian sexual health, \"or lesbians in general.\" They might not use it, but the dental dam remains a product they can point to and feel acknowledged. As Constable puts it, \"it\u2019s about wanting to be reassured that we are worth something.\"\nPhotography by Michael Shane\n","Title":"Oral history: the sexual misadventures of the dental dam | The Verge","Tags":["report","science"]}
