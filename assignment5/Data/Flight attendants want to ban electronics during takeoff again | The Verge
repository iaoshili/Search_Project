According to  the Associated Press , the largest flight attendant's union in the US \u2014 the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA \u2014 is suing the FAA in hopes of having its new rules overturned. The union argues that use of small electronics is a danger because they can become projectiles during turbulence and because they may cause passengers to pay less attention during safety announcements.\nAirlines still have the ultimate choice\nThe union alleges that the administration failed to properly provide public notice and receive comments on the rule change. The administration did request and receive public feedback before making the change, however the union argues that it was not through the correct procedure. Ultimately, the rule change still leaves the choice up to airlines on whether or not use of electronics should be allowed.\nAfter the ban was  lifted last year , airlines quickly began allowing passengers to use electronics. According to the AP, enough major airlines have lifted the ban that about 96 percent of commercial passengers should now be able to use electronics during takeoff and landing \u2014 a change that passengers generally seem to be happy about. It sounds like it's bound to stay that way too. Though the case has been brought to a DC appellate court, the AP reports that the judges didn't seem to be buying the union's argument. \"Airlines have always had discretion on how to handle this,\" one judge told the union's lawyer.\n","Title":"Flight attendants want to ban electronics during takeoff again | The Verge","Tags":["policy","us-world"]}
