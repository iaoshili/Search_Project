{"Main text":"Listen to Lorde's song for the 'Hunger Games' soundtrack\n\"I'm a princess cut from marble.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNot only is Lorde responsible for curating the soundtrack for the next Hunger Games, but she actually created a song for it herself \u2014 and it's  just been released . The song is called \"Yellow Flicker Beat,\" and while you're  right to be skeptical of how good a movie-soundtrack song can be, this one is actually worth listening to. It's another solid single from Lorde, with a haunting vibe and an awesome chorus with synths whining all around her. It's less about the movie than it is meant for the movie: a strong drumbeat makes the whole thing sound like it's meant for a march, and war is certainly coming in Mockingjay.  Lorde says it's her attempt to get inside of Katniss\u2019 head. The film comes out on November 21st.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
