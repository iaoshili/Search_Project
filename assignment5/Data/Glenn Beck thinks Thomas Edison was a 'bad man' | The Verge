{"Main text":"Glenn Beck thinks Thomas Edison was a 'bad man'\nConservative pundit's forthcoming film aims to expose celebrated inventor's dark side\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nConservative pundit Glenn Beck is making a movie that he hopes will expose the truth about celebrated American inventor Thomas Edison. In a wide-ranging interview with the National Review , Beck said that although Edison is widely seen as \"this nice, kind of, good old Thomas,\" his film will expose him for the person he really was: \"a bad man who was electrocuting animals.\"\nThe Edison film is one of three movies that Beck is working on \u2014 another will tell \"the real story of Christmas\" \u2014 though it's not clear whether it will be a documentary or drama, and he did not name a release date in his interview with the National Review. What's clear, though, is that Beck thinks Edison has been unfairly represented in history, and he wants to set the record straight.\n\"He was a bad man.\"\nAccording to the former Fox News host, Edison \"was absolutely on the wrong end, and luckily for him the story ended happily with his name being taken off his own company and given to GE. And all the people he tried to destroy and screw \u2014 he was screwed.\"\n\"I think that\u2019s the story that needs to be told about Thomas Edison,\" he continued. \"He was a bad man.\"\nAs Gizmodo points out, Beck has waxed poetic about inventors in the past, showing particular affection toward Nikola Tesla, who had a heated rivalry with Edison. In a December episode of his radio show The Blaze, Beck said the world would've been closer to a more advanced, Jetsons-like future had Tesla's inventions been embraced more openly.\n\"My iPad would never go dry,\" he said. \"I\u2019d never have to plug it in because he would just be sending electricity concentrated through the air.\"\n","Title":"Glenn Beck thinks Thomas Edison was a 'bad man' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","science"]}
