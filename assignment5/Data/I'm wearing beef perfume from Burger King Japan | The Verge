{"Main text":"I'm wearing beef perfume from Burger King Japan\nSo you don't have to\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nToday is April Fools\u2019 Day, and if you\u2019re planning to spend it on the internet, you\u2019re no doubt prepared for a barrage of \u201Chilarious\u201D brand-fed pranks that\u2019ll make you more or less write off the legitimacy of any news all day.\nJapan can be a little bit different.\nA few weeks ago, Burger King\u2019s local arm announced that it would produce a limited-edition meat perfume called \u201CFlame-Grilled Fragrance\u201D and sell it on April 1st. \u201CBurger King customers can wear the much-loved, flame-grilled patty scent on their bodies, letting them feel like they\u2019re in a restaurant any time,\u201D read an excited press release. But the date, along with the fact that Burger King\u2019s most famous sandwich is named after a synonym for \u201Clie,\u201D led many to believe that it was an early April Fools\u2019 joke.\nI wasn\u2019t so sure. If any country in the world would sell an obviously ridiculous product for one day only, it\u2019d have to be Japan: geographically small, ultra-efficient local manufacturing, and a significant number of people willing to line up for almost anything. So, down I went to my nearest Burger King this morning to see what was up.\nBurger King\u2019s Shibuya outlet is a minute\u2019s walk down the busiest pedestrian street off the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world, so I figured there\u2019d be some turnout. Sure enough, when I arrived at around 10AM, there were a few people waiting inside for the fragrance, and by the time it went on sale half an hour later there was a line snaking up the staircase.\nFlame-Grilled Fragrance costs about $42\nFlame-Grilled Fragrance costs ¥5,000, which is about $42. You do get a Whopper with it, but no fries or drink are included, which I felt was kind of outrageously stingy for the price. I don\u2019t ever really go to Burger King \u2014 though I did attempt to eat a seven-patty \"Windows 7 Whopper\" at this very store upon the 2009 release of Microsoft\u2019s OS \u2014 and I don\u2019t even have breakfast most days, let alone burgers. But I don\u2019t usually walk all the way to Shibuya in the morning, either, so I dutifully ate the Whopper. It was surprisingly bad. Burgers might not be the most obvious example of Tokyo gourmet, but this is actually a great city for them, and I can confirm that there is no good reason to go to Burger King here.\nUnless they\u2019re selling dumb, limited-edition perfume, of course. So how about it?\nWell.\nThe human nose only has around 400 types of scent receptors, but some researchers believe that these can work together with the brain to identify at least one trillion different odors. I\u2019m telling you this because without having your own bottle of Flame-Grilled Fragrance on hand, it\u2019ll be difficult to understand just how little it smells like a burger.\nWords do not exist in the English language to describe what Flame-Grilled Fragrance smells like. It\u2019s something like the burnt-rubber skidmarks left by a box-fresh-MacBook-carrying courier scooter after it crashed into a bacon salt factory. If I ever had to appear on Family Feud and name this scent, \"Burger King Whopper\" would be a few hundred billion down the list of trillion possibilities.\nIt is truly, unspeakably terrible\nIt is truly, unspeakably terrible, and I say that as someone who only ever wears a fragrance that\u2019s meant to evoke cigars .\nI don\u2019t know what I was expecting, but I don\u2019t think believable hamburger perfume is beyond the reach of science. Eric Schlosser\u2019s Fast Food Nation, which I read over a decade ago in my pre-Japan, hardcore vegetarian days, has a great section where the author visits International Flavors and Fragrances (IFF), a giant company that manufactures artificial scents and flavor agents for various foods and perfumes.\n\"[Senior flavorist Brian] Grainger\u2019s most remarkable creation took me by surprise,\" Schlosser wrote . \"After closing my eyes, I suddenly smelled a grilled hamburger. It smelled like someone else in the room was flipping burgers on a hot grill. But when I opened my eyes, there was just a narrow strip of white paper and a smiling flavorist.\"\nBurger King appears not to have consulted such miracle-workers when developing Flame-Grilled Fragrance. Which, well, was probably the right decision for a joke product that\u2019s only available for one day. So, while I could maybe at least claim \"journalistic interest,\" at the end of the day they won by getting the least-deserved ¥5,000 ever out of me.\nIt turns out the biggest April Fools are the ones falling for things that are actually real.\n","Title":"I'm wearing beef perfume from Burger King Japan | The Verge","Tags":["culture","hands--on","tldr","front-page\",\"Additional Placements\"","\"eater"]}
