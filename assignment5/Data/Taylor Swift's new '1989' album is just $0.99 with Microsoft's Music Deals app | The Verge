{"Main text":"Taylor Swift's new '1989' album is just $0.99 with Microsoft's Music Deals app\nA surprise deal from Redmond\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft\u2019s new  Music Deals app only launched last week, but it\u2019s already making waves thanks to a massive deal on Taylor Swift\u2019s new 1989 album today. For just $0.99 you can own Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album that only debuted yesterday. The same album is priced at $12.99 on the US iTunes Store, highlighting the 90 percent off sale here. Microsoft isn\u2019t making noise about the promotion just yet though, quietly promoting the $0.99 deal on its  Windows Twitter account this afternoon. It appears that the deals are limited to the US.\nAll part of a new weekly Music Deals app\nAlthough Taylor Swift\u2019s latest album is the most high profile deal right now,  Microsoft is planning to offer 101 albums for $1.99 or less each Tuesday with its new Music Deals app for Windows 8 and Windows Phone. Top albums from Jay Z, Kanye West, Drake, and 2Pac are available this week as part of a Hip Hop promotion. Microsoft is also offering up 50 metal albums for $1.99 or less this week. It's not clear if Microsoft has a special arrangement in place with Taylor Swift, but given 1989 isn't yet available on streaming services like Spotify it's likely that Microsoft is paying a huge amount of money for this particular promotion.\nAll albums are available in MP3 format from the Xbox Music store, the same service that is  closing its free streaming service in December. While Xbox Music will continue as a paid streaming service, Microsoft\u2019s new approach to its music offerings is clearly one that offers albums at cut prices to entice consumers into Xbox Music, Windows 8, and Windows Phone. If you\u2019re interested in Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 or the many hip hop and metal albums available this week you have 6 days left to buy them all before next Tuesday when Microsoft refreshes the app with new deals.\n","Title":"Taylor Swift's new '1989' album is just $0.99 with Microsoft's Music Deals app | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","culture","good-deals","entertainment","tech"]}
