{"Main text":"Concrete twists and turns in this trippy music video\nThe video was shot for Metronomy's \"Month of Sundays.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBrutalist buildings \u2014 the kind you find on some university campuses, and all over Washington, D.C. \u2014 are frequently maligned. They're slabs of concrete; they're eyesores. There was  a myth they were designed to quell student riots. But British band Metronomy and director Callum Cooper have found a way to make them weird.\nTo create the music video for \"Month of Sundays,\" Cooper took the band to London's Barbican Estate. Using a system of spinning cameras, he shot the musicians as they wandered through the building, then edited the footage together into the jumpy video you see here. To be sure, it's disorienting, but also a lot of fun. The song's pretty great, too.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
