{"Main text":"Steve Carell is making a movie with 'Eternal Sunshine' writer Charlie Kaufman\nKaufman is writing an adaptation for the book 'IQ 83,' and Carell will star\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSteve Carell is generating early Oscar buzz for his performance in the upcoming drama Foxcatcher, but now there's exciting news about a project that's further out.  Deadline reports that Carell has signed on to star in an adaptation of the 1978 sci-fi novel IQ 83, and surrealist auteur Charlie Kaufman is now re-writing the script.\nThe movie will be 'Stranglove'-esque\nIn the book, a plague begins dumbing down humanity, and the hero, Dr. James Healey, leads a team of scientists searching for a cure. The territory sounds strange \u2014 Deadline says it'll be Strangelove-esque \u2014 but also like the perfect fit for both Carell and Kaufman. While Carell has stretched his range recently, leaving his comedian past behind for darker, more dramatic roles, he's also great at hitting the mid-range between melancholy and clowning, a la Little Miss Sunshine. Likewise for Kaufman, who's built a writing career through odd, literary movies like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Being John Malkovich.\nThere are still details that need to be worked out: there's no director signed on yet, for one. But a Kaufman-Carell team-up is sure to draw interest.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
