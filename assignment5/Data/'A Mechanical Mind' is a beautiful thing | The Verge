It quickly dawned upon him that the techniques used to make the pendants could be re-purposed for spider legs. \"Everything just kind of fell together. After that, I began experimenting with other bugs, like dragonflies, butterflies, a mantis, and eventually a scorpion.\"\nGershenson-Gates generally begins each new piece with a roundabout idea of what he's hoping to accomplish. However, he also leaves room for it to \"create itself.\" Because of this, Gershenson-Gates says he has seen grasshoppers morph into dinosaurs and spiders turn into gorillas. All of his pieces are completed in a single sitting. According to Gershenson-Gates, a scorpion can take anywhere between a grueling eight to 12 hours to finish.\n\"I can never leave something unfinished,\" he confesses. \"I'll lose sleep if something is lying around without being completed.\"\nIn addition to custom orders, Gershenson-Gates is also developing prototypes for new sculptures. He wants to give his sculptures some degree of flexibility \u2014 even though finding or creating hinges measuring just 1\/16th of an inch can be challenging. \"To be stagnant and doing the same thing over and over would just kill me,\" he says.\nThe creative force behind A Mechanical Mind says that when he thinks of success, he thinks of talking to his ten-year-old self and \"wondering what would be cool for him to be when he grows up.\"\n\"I remember saying that I wanted to be an artist\/heart surgeon, so at least he'd be pretty happy with half of that equation.  I don't want to ever let him down.\"\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nIt takes a lot of time and effort to put together one of the creations you see on Gershenson-Gates' website.\nGershenson-Gates make mantises out of parts scavenged from old watches.\nGershenson-Gates occasionally makes fantastical beasts straight out of his own imagination.\nGershenson-Gates is looking to make his metallic sculptures more dynamic.\nThe jellyfish that Gershenson-Gates create are nowhere near as deadly as the real things.\n\"Watch parts just kind of lend themselves to insects' bodies and legs,\" Gershenson-Gates says.\n\"Strangler, which is a four-armed evolution of a spiky spined imaginary creature series, is my current favorite-ever creation,\" Gershenson-Gates says.\n","Title":"'A Mechanical Mind' is a beautiful thing | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
