The show originally ended after seven seasons in 2007, but fans will be able to stream new episodes beginning this year. Ten new episodes will come to Netflix before the end of 2014, along with all previous seasons of the show (where they aren't already available), three standalone specials, and two full-length films. The deal includes all of Netflix's current markets, meaning subscribers in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, the Nordics, and Latin America will be able to stream Trailer Park Boys for the first time starting March 31st. (New episodes will arrive at a later date.)\nThe shift to online distribution comes after stars Robb Wells, John Paul Tremblay and Mike Smith purchased the rights to the cult hit from the show's original producers. \"There's no other trio quite like Julian, Ricky and Bubbles, and we're thrilled to be the new home for these beloved hellraisers,\" said Sean Carey, Netflix's vice president of content acquisition, in a statement. Shot in a mockumentary style, Trailer Park Boys follows the misadventures of a group of residents living at Sunnyvale Trailer Park in Nova Scotia. Netflix notes there have been some changes since viewers parted ways with the trio: Ricky has apparently hidden an \"enormous weed crop\" in the walls of his trailer, Julian has managed to open a bar and gym inside his own trailer, and Bubbles is hoping to establish a \"Shed and Breakfast\" business.\n","Title":"Netflix is making two new seasons of 'Trailer Park Boys' | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","entertainment","tech"]}
