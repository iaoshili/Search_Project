{"Main text":"Stressful tea bag designs relax in hot water\nA marketing campaign illustrates how tea transforms people\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe relaxing properties of camomile tea are beautifully captured in these ingenious tea bags created by the Malaysian advertising branch of M&C Saatchi. Each sachet features an image composed of edible ink made from tea that transforms when placed in hot water. The initial designs are representative of stress: thunderclouds, flames, and angry speech bubbles. The symbols that appear after the ink has dissolved are calmer in nature. Hawks become doves, volcanoes turn into tranquil mountains, raging fires quiet into candle flames, and so on. While delightful, these tea bags were produced for a creative campaign organized by a Malaysian tea company called BOH and are not widely available for purchase.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
