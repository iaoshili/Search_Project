{"Main text":"The awesome oldies mix from 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is still the best-selling album in the country\nHere's how to listen to all of it\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThere are a lot of good things about Guardians of the Galaxy. Groot is one. The fact that Vin Diesel plays Groot is another. Chris Pratt is also awesome. But one of the very best things about the summer blockbuster is its soundtrack, the \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" that even factors into the plot of the movie. By some alchemical mix of the movie itself and the combined excellence of the Jackson 5, David Bowie, Redbone, and the Raspberries, this collection of music from the '70s has now spent two consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200. It's estimated to have sold 93,000 copies in the previous week (down from 109,000 the week previous), putting it firmly above the \"Now 51\" collection and the never-dying Frozen soundtrack. Take that, pop music.\nThere are two things to take away from GotG's success. One, the album-buying public really loves compilations and collections; \"Awesome Mix Vol. 1\" sold nearly three times as well as the best-selling band, the Gaslight Anthem. Two, music was awesome in the '70s. And everybody knows it.\nIf you don't enjoy the feeling of a round disc or a nice crisp MP3 file, the sheer age of the songs from the soundtrack mean they're all quite easy to find. Users of almost every music service quickly made playlists to copy the tracklist, so you can get your Groot dance on without spending a nickel.
