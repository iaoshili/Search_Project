{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYour chance to take selfies with Yoda, Han Solo, and Chewbacca is almost here \u2014 dead-eyed wax versions of the Star Wars heroes, at least. London's venerable waxwork museum,  Madame Tussauds, is opening a special multi-million dollar Star Wars show this May in the British capital, in collaboration with Disney and Lucasfilm. The exhibition will recreate 11 sets from the two Star Wars movie trilogies, including Yoda's swampy home on the planet of Dagobah, the Millennium Falcon's cockpit, and the Mos Eisley cantina where either Greedo or Han shot first, depending on who you believe.\nThe exhibition comes only six months ahead of the  release of the seventh Star Wars film , The Force Awakens, but it won't feature any waxy versions of characters from the new movie. Instead, Madame Tussauds will play host to 16 heroes and villains from Star Wars Episodes I to VI, including Luke's guide in the ways of the force, Yoda. The diminutive Jedi Master \u2014 900 years old at the time of his appearance in The Empire Strikes Back \u2014 is the focus of a short video put out by Madame Tussauds, in which the museum's staff explain how they sculpted his wrinkly face out of clay before coating it in resin and filling the resultant mold with wax. To complete the look, the museum's sculptors jabbed long white hairs into waxwork Yoda's skin \u2014 a process that will presumably take longer when they get around to creating their inanimate Chewbacca.\n","Title":"Madame Tussauds is recreating Star Wars in wax | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
