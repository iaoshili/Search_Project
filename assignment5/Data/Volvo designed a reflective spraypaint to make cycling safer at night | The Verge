{"Main text":"Volvo designed a reflective spraypaint to make cycling safer at night\nIt's available in parts of the UK, for now\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVolvo is turning its attention to two-wheeled safety, for the moment. The Swedish car manufacturer and UK design firm Grey London have partnered with  Albedo100 to create a reflective spraypaint that's only visible at night. It's called  LifePaint , but it's technically not paint; it's a washable material that lasts about 10 days after application. It's also completely invisible until it's hit by the glare of a car's headlights \u2014 then it glows.\n\"Every year more than 19,000 cyclists are injured on the UK\u2019s roads,\" Nick Connor, managing director at Volvo Car UK said  in a statement . \"At Volvo, we believe that the best way to survive a crash is not to crash, and are committed to making the roads a safer place by reducing the number of accidents.\"\nVolvo says the water-based LifePaint can safely be applied to clothes, helmets, shoes, backpacks, and even dog leashes. The spray isn't available everywhere yet. Right now, it's available in six cycling shops in Kent and London, and if it does well, Volvo may move the product internationally.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
