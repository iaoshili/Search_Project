{"Main text":"The Onion reminds us that Comcast knows best\nOur online future lampooned\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nComcast  isn't very well-liked, thanks in part to its disregard for  historic signage and  monopolistic tendencies. As such, it's unsurprising to see satirical news source The Onion taking a dig at the American cable company. The one-minute clip explores a dystopian future where every channel and website will play a \"heartfelt and hilarious\" one-man show starring the Comcast president until customers learn to love it. The interface is so streamlined that fast forward or skipping is not allowed, but particularly idolatrous viewers will have the option to rewind and watch the program again and again.\nDisclosure: Comcast Ventures is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge's parent company.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
