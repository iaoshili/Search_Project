{"Main text":"Apple is building a Watch shop in this Tokyo luxury department store\nApple rubs shoulders with Cartier at Isetan\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nHow do you buy a $17,000 smartwatch? Probably not by struggling to get the attention of a T-shirt-wearing employee in a crowded Apple Store. So, although Apple occupies some of the most coveted and profitable retail space in the world, it\u2019s taking a different approach when it starts to sell the Apple Watch next month, putting it in department stores and boutiques around the world.\nOne example is here in Tokyo, where Apple is constructing a Watch shop inside Shinjuku\u2019s Isetan, one of the biggest and most famous department stores in Japan. It\u2019s the first thing you see when you enter the store \u2014 an ominous black box right by the entrance, marked only with the Apple Watch logo and a subtitle saying \u201CComing soon\u201D in Japanese. Though you can\u2019t see inside the closed doors just yet, the floor space is sizeable, and Apple is right next to fine jewelry brand Cartier.\nAs a wearable device, the absolute most important thing is that people want to wear the Apple Watch above all else; if they don\u2019t, the product can\u2019t succeed. But Apple thinks people will want to wear it, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be taking on fashion and luxury brands on their own turf. It\u2019s the reason Apple opened a new store in hip Omotesando last year, yet doesn\u2019t have an outlet in nerd mecca Akihabara \u2014 it\u2019d rather be thought of as a premium brand in its own right than as a tech company.\nThe Isetan store will open on April 10th, when pop-up shops will also open at Selfridges in London and Galeries Lafayette in Paris, letting visitors try on the Apple Watch for themselves. The three department stores will all sell the watch come April 24th, and boutiques including Paris\u2019 Colette ,  Los Angeles\u2019 Maxfield, Berlin\u2019s The Corner, and Dover Street Market in London and Tokyo will also carry it from that date.\nVerge Video: Hands-on with the Apple Watch\n","Title":"Apple is building a Watch shop in this Tokyo luxury department store | The Verge","Tags":["apple","photo-essay","tech"]}
