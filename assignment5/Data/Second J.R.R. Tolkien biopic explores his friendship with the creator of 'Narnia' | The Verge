{"Main text":"Second J.R.R. Tolkien biopic explores his friendship with the creator of 'Narnia'\n'Tolkien and Lewis' planned for an Easter release\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFilm company Attractive Films is hoping to have its J.R.R. Tolkien biopic in theaters before Chernin Entertainment can do the same. According to The Hollywood Reporter , the $18 million feature will pivot around the author's relationship with C.S. Lewis, whom Tolkien helped re-introduce to Christianity some years after Lewis had become an atheist at the age of 15. Set largely in the beginning of World War II, Tolkien and Lewis will also touch on the darker aspects of the writers' complex and turbulent friendship.\nIts theological undercurrents make Tolkien and Lewis a stark contrast to  Chernin Entertainment's Tolkien , which looks at a vastly different period in the author's life. The latter explores the World War I veteran's time in Oxford University's Pembroke College, his military service, and how these experiences would later influence his literary work. Attractive Films is pushing for an Easter release in hopes of courting the \"faith-based audience.\" Tolkien and Lewis will be directed by The Expendables 2's Simon West, and produced by Mark Joseph, Mark Cooper, Jib Polhemus, and Charles Moore.\nCorrection: This article originally stated that C.S. Lewis helped convert Tolkien to Christianity. Tolkien was the one who eventually influenced Lewis to embrace Christianity.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
