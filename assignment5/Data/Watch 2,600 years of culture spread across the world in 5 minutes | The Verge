{"Main text":"Watch 2,600 years of culture spread across the world in 5 minutes\nThis video map of the journeys of creative people is mesmerizing\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe personal journeys of world-changing thinkers such as Leonardo Da Vinci are fascinating enough in their own right, but what happens when you track the paths of thousands of similarly influential individuals across space and time?
