Twin Peaks may still be very much alive at Showtime.\n\u2014 David Lynch (@DAVID_LYNCH) April 5, 2015\nThat, in turn, has prompted the Twin Peaks cast to release a video asking to get Lynch back. The two-minute video includes about a dozen series regulars like Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer \/ Maddy Ferguson), Mädchen Amick (Shelley Johnson), and Catherine Coulson (The Log Lady) along with David Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who wrote the book The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer \u2014 all providing their own take on the prompt, \"Twin Peaks without David Lynch is like... ?\" The video reportedly appeared first on  Amick's Whosay account , which subsequently links to a fairly new Facebook page, \" Official Twin Peaks Cast run site .\" There's also a  Welcome To Twin Peaks website and a  change.org petition that has almost 15,000 signatures as of this writing. And yes, there's an official hashtag, #savetwinpeaks.\n\"Twin Peaks without David Lynch is like...\"\nThere are a few notable absences from this video, including Michael Ontkean (Sheriff Harry Truman), Lara Flynn Boyle (Donna Hayward), and Kyle MacLachlan (Special Agent Dale Damn Fine Cup of Coffee Cooper). Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost, also not in the video, is reportedly still attached to the project. The whole video is an appropriately weird show of force, and it speaks to how passionate the cast is to the project and to Lynch's involvement. That doesn't mean Showtime and Lynch will compromise, but it's a pretty big show of support.\n","Title":"The cast of Twin Peaks made a video to bring back David Lynch and #savetwinpeaks | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment","tv"]}
