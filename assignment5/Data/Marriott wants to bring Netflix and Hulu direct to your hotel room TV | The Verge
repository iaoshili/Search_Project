{"Main text":"Marriott wants to bring Netflix and Hulu direct to your hotel room TV\nAnd Pandora too\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe same hotel chain that got in hot water for  keeping its guests from using their own Wi-Fi appears to have opened up on the things people stream on its televisions. Marriott is reportedly testing a new TV service that lets guests log into their personal Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora accounts as opposed to paying extra to view its on-demand movies. \nYou might have to pay for it though\nThe new service, which Bloomberg describes as a \"test,\" is reportedly underway at eight of the company's hotels, though could expand to others. It's currently unclear whether the feature is included as part of a room bill, or if it will be charged as an additional service. Bloomberg suggests that if it's the latter, Netflix and the other service providers would get some revenue shared back in return.\nAs for what Marriott hotels are a part of the test for the new service, that too is unclear, though it appears the company flipped the switch on the program at the end of last week.\nOh my god NETFLIX ON THE TV IN THE MARRIOTT YESSSSS time to watch Buffy in style :D\n\u2014 Tackle-me Grizztof (@Grizztof) January 18, 2015\nMarriott came under fire after it was discovered that employees at its Gaylord Opryland Hotel & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee were using a jammer to block people from using personal hotspots to connect to the internet.

Even so, the hotel chain petitioned to block guest use of personal Wi-Fi, citing security reasons including the safety of guest information and security.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
