According to the latest NPD data drop, the Xbox One was the number one selling console in both the US and the UK for November. The PS4 had previously been on top in the US for months, but it sounds like the holiday season and corresponding price drops for the Xbox One made a big difference for the console.  Geekwire reports that US Xbox One sales last month were 1.2 million.\nAccording to Gamespot , Xbox VP of marketing Mike Nichols confirmed Microsoft's winning month, saying \"November set a new record for sales of Xbox One, and Xbox One was the best-selling console in the US and UK.\" This comes about a month after Microsoft announced that the  Xbox One hit 10 million consoles sold ; at the time, the company appeared bullish on the console's prospects for beating Sony thanks to a $50 price cut and an increasingly strong software lineup. Sony, on the other hand, has stuck with the PS4's original $399 price point \u2014 but we'll have to see if Microsoft's big month leads the company to consider price cuts.\nAs usual, Nintendo stayed out of the competition between Sony and Microsoft, but had a few interesting tidbits of news to drop. The  excellent Super Smash Bros. for Wii U sold almost 710,000 copies in the month, even though it didn't launch until November 21st. At the same time, Nintendo also launched its  unusual Amiibo real-world toys that players can use to interact with certain Wii U games \u2014 and apparently they were also big sellers for the company. Nintendo said that Amiibo sales were \"approximately equal\" to sales of Super Smash Bros. The conversion rate between video games and toys isn't exactly clear, but if the company managed to generate the same amount of revenue from Amiibo as it did from one of its most popular games, that'll be a nice bump for the company's bottom line.\nVerge Video Archives: E3 2014 and the Future of XBox\n","Title":"Xbox One breaks the PS4's winning streak with 1.2 million sales in November | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","gaming","tech"]}
