{"Main text":"Listen to Madonna rap every illuminati buzzword in one of her six new songs\nDid she just say \"the Google of United States\"?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCombating the  full leak of her then-unannounced album Rebel Heart this past Wednesday, Madonna has decided to officially release the first six tracks, including the Nicki Minaj collaboration \"Bitch I'm Madonna.\" But that is not the song I'm currently obsessing over in this sextet.\nEven if you don't want to purchase or stream, it's worth your time to enjoy  iTunes's minute-long preview of our new favorite dance track about conspiracy theories, \"Illuminati,\" where Madonna slides between singing and rapping about accused illuminati luminaries like Jay Z, Beyonce, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and... did she just say \"the Google of United States?\"\nI've now listened to this song, in full, about a dozen times. I can't vouch these are 100 percent the right lyrics... but it's awfully close.\nIt's not Jay Z and Beyoncé\nIt's not Nicki or Lil Wayne\nIt's not Oprah and Obama\nThe Pope and Rihanna\nIt's not pentagrams or witchcraft\nIt's not triangles or stacks of cash\nBlack magic or Gaga, Gucci or Prada\nRiding on the golden calf\nThe all-seeing eye is watching tonight\nThat's what it is tonight, truth and the light\nThe all-seeing eye is watching tonight\nNothing to hide, secrets inside\nIt's like everybody in this party, shining like illuminati\nIt's like everybody in this party, shining like illuminati\nIt's the enlightenment that started it all\nThe founding fathers wrote it down on the wall\nAnd now the media's misleading us all\nTo right and to wrong\nIt's time to dance and turn this dark into something\nSo let the fire burn, this music is bumping\nWe're gonna live forever, love never dies\nIt starts tonight\nBehind the curtain of the new world order\nIt's not platinum-encrypted corners\nIt's not Isis or the phoenix,\nThe pyramids of Egypt\nDon't make it into something sordid\nIt's not Steve Jobs or Bill Gates\nIt's not the Google of United States\nIt's not Bieber or LeBron, Clinton or Bond\nor anyone you love to hate\nRepeat Chorus and Bridge, etc.\n","Title":"Listen to Madonna rap every illuminati buzzword in one of her six new songs | The Verge","Tags":["apple","google","culture","tldr","entertainment","tech"]}
