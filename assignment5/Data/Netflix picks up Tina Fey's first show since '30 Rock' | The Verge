That is, until tonight: Netflix just announced that it has picked up the show for two seasons and will premiere the 13-episode season this March in all Netflix territories. Kimmy Schmidt stars Ellie Kemper as the survivor of a doomsday cult who starts over in New York \u2014 yes, it's a comedy. The show also stars 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski, Titus Burgess, and Carol Kane (Fey, notably, is not billed a regular cast member).\nNBC seems very supportive of the move. This is NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt:\n\"When the opportunity arose for Tina Fey and Robert Carlock to premiere their new show on Netflix with a two-season commitment, we decided this was the best possible scenario to launch this captivating new series.  While it was originally developed for NBC, we have a very drama-heavy mid-season schedule so we're thrilled about this Netflix opportunity; it's an instant win-win for everyone, including Tina, Robert, and Universal Television. We're already talking to these extraordinary creators about new development for NBC, but meanwhile, everyone here from Universal Television will do everything possible to see that Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt becomes a long-running hit on Netflix.\"\nImportant note: Kimmy Schmidt is still produced by Universal Television.\nAnd now we probably won't have to wait 13 weeks to see the entire show.\n","Title":"Netflix picks up Tina Fey's first show since '30 Rock' | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","breaking","entertainment"]}
