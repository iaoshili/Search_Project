{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI slept terribly last night. I don\u2019t know exactly why, but between going to sleep at 11:56PM and waking up at 6:49AM, I woke up 12 times. I got two hours and 45 minutes of light sleep and one hour and one minute of restful sleep. I woke up feeling like garbage.\n33 minutes and 51 seconds of exercise later (maximum heart rate: 118 beats per minute), I feel a little better. It\u2019s going to take me an hour and two minutes for my body to recover, which is just enough time to shower and eat breakfast. Then I have to get to the office for a 9:00 meeting.\nI know all of this because the Microsoft Band knows all of this. The Band is the first hardware iteration of Microsoft Health, an ambitious and cross-platform attempt to centralize and utilize all the world\u2019s fitness data . Microsoft hopes to integrate it first with devices and apps and then with our calendar and email, to tell us everything about how we\u2019re living and how to live better. It\u2019s supposed to be the One True Source of health data.\nHealth is the trunk, and the $199 Band is the first branch. I\u2019ve been wearing one for more than a week, and I\u2019ve learned a lot. About the Band, about wearables, about health and tracking, about Microsoft. About myself.\nOur hands-on of the Band from October\nLet me be clear here: the Microsoft Band is not a smartwatch. It\u2019s a fitness tracker, meant to count your steps, check your heartbeat, and follow you on runs. It grabs notifications from your phone, sure, and does so as reliably as any other device, but you can\u2019t do anything other than dismiss them or ignore them unless you use Windows Phone. Even doing that takes more swipes and clicks than it should. More likely than not, you\u2019ll end up with a long list of emails and calendar reminders that you have to remove from the Band and then again from your phone. It\u2019s vaguely helpful and vaguely annoying all at once.\nI don\u2019t even want it to be a smartwatch. Smartwatches and trackers just have fundamentally different, even competing needs. A smartwatch must have a big, useful screen. It must also be fashionable and easy to interact with. I\u2019ll put it on in the morning, matching it my outfit. I\u2019ll take it off at night and when I shower. A tracker, on the other hand, must be invisible. It should just be there, all the time, collecting data without me ever thinking about it. I don\u2019t know how any company will resolve those two things, and it seems to me that the smart bet is making the best of one or the other. Right now the Band straddles the middle, and it doesn\u2019t quite work.\nSmartwatches are smartwatches, and fitness trackers are fitness trackers\nI almost wish Microsoft had just untethered it from my phone entirely, because the Band\u2019s self-reliance is one of its best features. Built-in GPS means I can go for a run, collecting data not only about my body but about the time, distance, and location of my route, without needing to carry anything. Being able to download a workout plan to my Band, and then leave my phone in the locker room or at home, makes everything easier. I\u2019m happy to sync everything back to my phone \u2014 it\u2019s a better interface for mapping data and getting advice anyway \u2014 but for the simple act of collecting all necessary and possible data, the tracker itself should be enough. The Band is enough, and it\u2019s awesome.\nIn fact, the only time it\u2019s really more useful when tethered to your phone is if you use a Windows Phone 8.1 device. (The Band may work with anything, but it\u2019s best with Windows Phone.) Cortana integration, which works pretty seamlessly for quick searches, timers, or messages \u2014 it\u2019s more or less what you get by saying \"Ok Google\" to your Android Wear device \u2014 really does add another dimension to the Band. Windows Phone also offers more fine-tuned notifications settings, so you won\u2019t just be bombarded with things you don\u2019t care about and can\u2019t do anything about anyway.\nThere's a right way to wear the Band \u2013 the ugly way\nThe Band is made to be worn one way and one way only: wrapped around your dominant wrist, screen facing inward. You can wear it screen-out \u2014 Microsoft\u2019s website even shows it that way in spots \u2014 but screen-in is the only way I can comfortably read the Band\u2019s horizontally scrolling interface without awkwardly contorting my elbow into my stomach. I\u2019ve come to like it, in some ways; it\u2019s easier to glance over and see the inside of my wrist when I\u2019m doing pushups or bench presses, and it\u2019s far more discrete than having my wrist light up the room every time I get a text message. But I also look like I\u2019ve developed a twitch, constantly rolling my arm over to see what\u2019s underneath, and I worry that wearing the Band screen-down, banging it against tables and desks all day, is going to scratch the display, adding to the small dings I've already created.\nWith the screen facing down, what most people will see on your wrist is the Band\u2019s backside. It looks like, well, a clasp. It doesn\u2019t look nice or fashionable, it looks like your ugly watch got turned around on your wrist. It\u2019s a really chunky, rigid, rectangular device \u2014 having worn the new Jawbone Up3 and even the Apple Watch, this rubbery black strap is easily among the most conspicuously unattractive fitness trackers available. The only thing I hope Microsoft keeps is the clasp: the sliding mechanism lets me tighten the Band, so it doesn\u2019t jostle while I\u2019m working out, and then loosen it so it\u2019s not in the way during the day. It\u2019s really, really clever and goes a long way (though not far enough) toward making the Band wearable all the time.\nI don\u2019t plan on spending much time looking at the Band\u2019s 1.4-inch, 320 x 106 screen, and not because it\u2019s a bad display. It\u2019s fine. But the point of the Band, like any fitness tracker, is to just do stuff. The screen turns on, I can read it in sunlight, and it shows me how many calories I\u2019m burning. That\u2019s good enough.\nFor a fitness tracker, pretty may be important, but comfortable is the ball game. The first couple of nights I tried to sleep with the Band on, I had to take it off. It was scratching against my skin, and the green lights of the heart rate sensor were glaring at me because I was wearing it a little too loosely. I also take it off when I sit down at my computer, and I have to take it off when I shower, because for some inexplicable and unforgivable reason, the Band isn\u2019t waterproof. (It is technically water-resistant, but even Microsoft warns fervently against doing anything more than wash your hands with it on.) I can live with a less-than-beautiful fitness tracker, but I see no point in buying one I won\u2019t wear all the time.\nA week of battery life should be the starting point\nSpeaking of reasons not to wear it all the time: the Band\u2019s battery needs to last longer. I consistently get two days between charges; I can get three if I never use GPS, but two is more normal. A full workweek should be the minimum acceptable number. If my fitness tracker can\u2019t last me Monday morning to Friday night without needing to charge, there\u2019s too good of a chance I\u2019ll take it off at work when it dies and forget to put it back on ever again. I don\u2019t want to charge it overnight, because then I can\u2019t track my sleep. I don\u2019t want to charge it during the day, because I\u2019ll miss activity. (Oh, and if it dies, all the data since the last time you synced is gone. Just gone. It\u2019s insane and unacceptable.)\nSpending hours tapping around the Band isn\u2019t the point, but it\u2019s at least easy to navigate. It shows three square tiles at a time, each representing a different app or information source. Tap here for workouts, here for your calendar, here to start a run. It\u2019s impossible to get lost in the interface, because all you have to do is tap or swipe back to the left to get home. It\u2019s easy, it\u2019s customizable, it\u2019s clever.\nThere are some bugs throughout, though, and that\u2019s not just frustrating for a fitness device, it\u2019s actually an impediment. Quickly moving from workout to workout or setting split times for a run requires that the Band will work the first time I try. It does, usually, but sometimes swipes don\u2019t register, or the tiles swipe along only to snap back to their original position when I take my finger off. The software here is strong, but it needs a little more work.\nThe Health app \u2014 for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and Windows \u2014 is similarly solid but unfinished. It\u2019s basically just a history of your data broken out by time or by activity. Tap on a number to see it on a chart, or to see it mapped over time. You can quickly personalize your band \u2014 which tiles appear, in what color, and in which order \u2014 and sync the two. It\u2019s lovely to look at and totally approachable, even for the newest user.\nUnfortunately, \"simple\" has this nasty penchant for also meaning \"underpowered.\" Why make such an incredibly powerful wristband and then not give me access to all its findings? I can\u2019t see my skin temperature anywhere, track my sleep over time, or compare more than a week of step data. All these things will come later, Microsoft says, but the rollout seems backward: the people who will buy this device are fitness enthusiasts who will want this data, and Microsoft is hiding too much of it.\nHealth is beautiful, but it's basic\nMicrosoft\u2019s target users also want powerful, accurate data, which is one of the great promises of Health. Microsoft is even licensing the Band\u2019s hardware, so other manufacturers can replicate its data collection. The Band has a vast array of sensors: optical heart rate, accelerometer, gyrometer, ambient light, GPS, UV, galvanic skin response (which measures sweat and stress), skin temperature, and a capacitive sensor. But for all it\u2019s measuring, even simple step-counting remains elusive. The Band sometimes reads me sitting at my desk as me taking steps. Or it reads me taking steps as me taking some other number of steps. Or it reads me twirling the band between my fingers as steps. It\u2019s not worse than your average step-tracker, certainly, but Microsoft promised a new level of data accuracy. I don\u2019t see it.\nThe fact is this, though: tracking my steps makes me take more of them. This has been true with every fitness tracker I\u2019ve used. The real lesson of these devices is that it doesn\u2019t matter  which one you use. Just use one. That\u2019s actually what Microsoft is after: Health is all about offering a wide array of apps and devices so that there\u2019s something for everyone, because any kind of tracking is better than no tracking at all.\nThe biggest change for me, personally, has been that perpetually knowing my heart rate has added an entirely new element to my self-improvement. It\u2019s helped me learn when I\u2019m stressed, even when I didn\u2019t notice it myself, and how things like sleep or food affect me. It\u2019s also a much better way to measure how hard I\u2019m exercising: if I\u2019m not near my maximum heart rate, I need to push harder.\nKnowing your heart rate is a remarkable thing\nThe default workout status on the Band is just \"I\u2019m working out.\" You click the Action button to start a workout, and the Band measures your calorie burn, heart rate, and more. But Microsoft also worked with the likes of Gold\u2019s Gym and Men\u2019s Fitness to create a bunch of guided workouts and workout plans that you can download to your band. Then you just pick the workout, click the button, and get after it. It buzzes with every workout, times your rest, and tells you what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. It\u2019s amazing, even if I didn\u2019t love having to glance over at my wrist every 30 seconds to find out what I was doing.\nI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself using the Band. For instance, I really do sleep terribly: I sleep lightly, I wake up a lot, and I rarely get a full cycle of REM sleep. That\u2019s great \u2014 the more you know and all that \u2014 but I have no idea why any of these things are the case. So far the only thing I can figure out is that I should go to bed earlier. What I really want to know is whether I keep the room too warm (or too cold) and whether I\u2019d sleep better with the blinds down. That\u2019s the thing about all fitness trackers: even the most powerful ones are only measuring internal data, data about me. The Band has a UV monitor, which can tell me whether I need sunscreen today, but there\u2019s still so much relevant external data that just isn\u2019t being considered. Even at this early stage, a few features seem obviously absent. If the Band knows my heart rate and my sleep stage, why can\u2019t it wake me up at the perfect moment in my sleep cycle, like so many other fitness trackers? It can track my activity and my sleep, so why do I have to manually switch modes when I go to bed every night?\nAt the end of it all, I just want Microsoft to do what it promised, and tell me what to do. Tell me to close my blinds, tell me to drink less coffee after 4PM, tell me to stop booking meetings at 8. Half of Health is all about data collection, and that\u2019s where the Band is strong. The other half is about doing things with that data, the promised \"actionable insights\" that will make me sleep, eat, and exercise better. I\u2019ve grown to love Jawbone\u2019s \"Today I Will\" items, notifications that pop up and challenge me to drink more water today or get to bed at a humane hour. Microsoft may someday have the data and the processing power to do much more than that, but none of that is here yet, and it makes it feel like I\u2019m just dumping all this data into a void.\nWe\u2019re a ways away from a full-on health revolution. The Band hardware needs a lot of work, and the software needs to be fully realized and tuned before we\u2019ll even begin to see its full potential. If you\u2019re in the market for a fitness tracker right now, this probably isn\u2019t the one to buy. It's a prototype, and an expensive one. It's a first try, because Microsoft had to start somewhere.\nBut Microsoft is on to something.\nThe company has all the right ideas \u2014 be multi-dimensional, be prescriptive, be everywhere \u2014 and the company readily admits the Band is just a first step. You have to start collecting data somewhere, right? It\u2019s not all that compelling yet, but Microsoft Health is going to get better, fast. I\u2019m not using the Band anymore, but I\u2019m dumping data from my  Jawbone Up24 into Microsoft Health, because it\u2019s already the easiest way for me to collect the most data about myself. I suspect that suits Microsoft just fine.\nThe Band isn't a great first try \u2014 but there's more to come\nThe competition is fierce and growing by the day, as companies from Google and Apple to Jawbone and Fitbit try to build platforms underneath their tracking devices. We\u2019re still early in every aspect of this market: health tracking, wearables, all of it. That\u2019s the fun. The Band won\u2019t set Microsoft apart yet, but it\u2019s not hard to see this as the crystal ball through which you can peer into a seriously exciting future full of rich data collection and actually valuable insights about how to live a little better tomorrow.\nHonestly, though, at this moment all I know for sure is one thing. I\u2019m going to bed early tonight.\nPhotography by Sean O'Kane\n","Title":"Microsoft Band review | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","review","tech"]}
