{"Main text":"Rosetta spacecraft is now orbiting a comet 249 million miles away\nA first for space exploration\nThe European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft made contact with the comet 67P\/CG, 10 years after being launched from French Guiana. This morning, it executed a \"close approach trajectory insertion,\" placing it within the gravitational pull of the comet.\nThruster burn complete. @ESA_Rosetta has arrived at comet #67P . We're in orbit!\n\u2014 ESA Operations (@esaoperations) August 6, 2014\nThe entire burn process lasted about six minutes and 26 seconds, and marks the first leg of a series of three-legged triangular paths about the comet, each of which will take about three to four days. Due to its distance from Earth, mission controllers from the agency needed to wait about 22 minutes before they could tell if the procedure had succeeded. If all goes well, Rosetta will then deploy the Philae lander in November. The European Space Agency put up a live webcast earlier to allow the curious to watch as the Rosetta closed in on the target.\nUpdate August 6th, 05:29AM: \"We're at the comet,\" declared one of the Rosetta Flight Control team members.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
