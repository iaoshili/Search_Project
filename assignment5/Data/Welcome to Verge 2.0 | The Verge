{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou might notice something a bit different about The Verge today. Open our site on any device, make your window any size. It works. Everywhere.\nAs of this morning, our website is 100 percent responsive. There\u2019s no more mobile site, no tablet site, no desktop site \u2014 there\u2019s just one Verge for everything. And everything loads much, much faster than it used to. We spent some serious time making sure we kept the soul of our beautiful design as we made the site responsive, but don\u2019t be fooled by what looks like visual changes only \u2014 under the hood, there\u2019s a completely rebuilt codebase that will allow us to iterate more quickly and deliver new features as fast as we can think of them. Think of it like Verge Hack Week , but for the site itself. Like all Vox Media sites, The Verge isÂ  built on Chorus, the industry\u2019s best publishing platform , and with Verge 2.0 we\u2019re ready to start pushing Chorus forward in really exciting new ways. It\u2019s going to be rad .\nNo more mobile site, no tablet site, no desktop site \u2014 just one Verge for everything\nThis also means that our dedicated apps and API for third-party apps will be going away. Apps are great, but The Verge is a website, and we want people to have the best experience with our content where it is created and designed to be viewed. Which is on the web. Because we\u2019re a website. There will be a relatively short transition period as we take down the apps and eventually turn off the API; this is a great time to switch your bookmarks and home screen icons to our site.\n(Most major smartphone platforms have gotten much better at saving a website to your home screen, and our icon looks quite fetching there. In Safari on iOS, it\u2019s a tap away in the Share menu, the square icon with the arrow sticking out. In Chrome on Android, it\u2019s an option under the menu. On Windows Phone, it\u2019s also an option under the More menu.)\nIn other exciting news, we\u2019re also launching a new section of the site we\u2019re calling TL;DR . In the spirit of old-school blogging , we wanted a space to share our thoughts with a thinner filter, make cool things, and point people to other great stuff on the web. It\u2019s a new section, but it feels like a return to something we\u2019ve been doing for a long time. We\u2019re going to be trying lots of different things in this space, and we\u2019re eager to hear your feedback.1\nHey, I found a bug with the new redesign\nThanks to those of you who have been helping us beta test for the past few weeks. Because of your help, we\u2019ve been able to identify and squash a ton of bugs.\nWe\u2019ve tried really hard, but it\u2019s still not perfect. You can send reports to support@theverge.com. All urgent issues will be immediately fixed once reported. We\u2019ve left a few of our long-form articles in the non-responsive layout, but we\u2019ll be switching some over on a case-by-case basis. Got a favorite? Let us know.\nThis is pretty great, who did all this?\nThe amazing product team from Vox Media. Special thanks goes out to Dan Chilton , Guillermo Esteves , Steve McKinney , Brent Laverty , Chao Li and Lauren Rabaino . This team has worked tirelessly for months on this project, and The Verge belongs to them as much as anyone.\nThey built us a rocketship, and now we\u2019re going to take it into the deep weirdness of extreme outer space. Touchdown.\n1. No affiliation with NPR\u2019s TLDR podcast , which is great and you should listen to it.\n","Title":"Welcome to Verge 2.0 | The Verge","Tags":["announcement","meta","design"]}
