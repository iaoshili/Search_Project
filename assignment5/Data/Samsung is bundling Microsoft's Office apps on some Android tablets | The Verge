{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSamsung is expanding on its recent partnership with Microsoft to preinstall Office on select Android tablets. The move follows a similar  bundling on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S6 handsets , with Microsoft's Skype, OneDrive, and OneNote apps preinstalled in a special \"Microsoft Apps\" folder that is pinned on the homescreen. Samsung will start preinstalling Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive, and Skype on \"select Android tablets\" in the first half of this year, with plans to offer Microsoft\u2019s Office 365 service to businesses that opt for Samsung devices.\n\"Our partnership with Samsung is emblematic of our efforts to bring the best of Microsoft's productivity services to everyone, on every device, so people can be productive wherever, however and whenever they want,\" explains Peggy Johnson, Microsoft\u2019s head of business development. While the partnership clearly backs up Microsoft\u2019s plans to have Office everywhere, it comes just over a month after Samsung and Microsoft ended a  bitter Android royalties dispute . Both companies announced the end of their contract dispute in a join statement last month, but kept the fresh deal terms confidential. Part of the court case revealed that  Microsoft earned $1 billion from Samsung in the form of patent-licensing loyalties during 2013.\nVerge Video: Windows 10 on tablets\n","Title":"Samsung is bundling Microsoft's Office apps on some Android tablets | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","google","tech"]}
