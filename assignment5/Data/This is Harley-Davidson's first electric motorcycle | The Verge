{"Main text":"This is Harley-Davidson's first electric motorcycle\nMeet Project LiveWire\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmerica's foremost bike manufacturer is leaving a century of tradition behind with the all-electric Project LiveWire , and it's inviting the public to help test it. While the company is being coy with details on the bike, it says LiveWire offers \"tire-shredding acceleration and an unmissable new sound,\" and is capable of hitting 0-60 in less than four seconds. LiveWire is not for sale, and is instead designed to help the company get \"insight into rider expectations\" of what a Harley-Davidson electric motorcycle should be.\n\"The Project LiveWire Experience\" will be a 30-city tour across the US, where potential customers can test ride the new bike and offer their opinions. It kicks off on June 24th in New York City before heading to Boston and Philadelphia. The other 27 cities on the tour will be announced next week, and Harley-Davidson says it'll expand the tour to more cities in the US, Canada, and Europe next year.\n\u201CAmerica at its best has always been about reinvention,\u201D says Harley-Davidson President Matt Levatich, \u201CAnd, like America, Harley-Davidson has reinvented itself many times in our history, with customers leading us every step of the way.\"\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
