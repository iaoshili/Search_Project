{"Main text":"15 Comments\nThere are a lot of exciting films coming out this month \u2014 including Boyhood and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes just this weekend, there are easily too many to see. And yet, it\u2019s hard not to start making our list for what we\u2019ll want to watch during the rest of the year. Down below we have eight of the latest trailers. You may have already seen some of them, but there's a decent change that you'll want to watch them again.\nBefore I Go To Sleep\nSomething terrible caused Christine Lucas to become an amnesiac, and she\u2019s trying to figure out just what that was \u2014 even with some obvious hurdles in her way.  Based on a novel of the same name, Before I Go To Sleep looks like a legitimately eerie thriller. It opens September 5th in the UK and September 12th in the US.\nUnbroken\nUnbroken tells the story of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini, who was taken prisoner by Japanese forces during World War II. It\u2019s coming out on Christmas, and by all means the movie looks like it\u2019s meant to be an uplifting, heart-warmer. Angelina Jolie directs, and the Coen Brothers are said to have worked on the script \u2014 so it may be worth keeping it mind.\nSharknado 2: The Second One\nSomehow, all of cinema history has led to this. After Sharknado became a surprise cult hit last year, Syfy quickly began work on a sequel. If the trailer is any indication, it\u2019ll be just as awful\u2026 but maybe that\u2019s a good thing.\nStarred Up\nStarred Up takes a scary look a the life of a young inmate after he\u2019s transferred to an adult prison. The film received wide acclaim coming out of the festival circuit, and next month it\u2019s finally heading to the US on the 29th.\nGone Girl\nDavid Fincher\u2019s next film is about a man trying to find his missing wife \u2014 but it isn't so clear that he wasn't involved with her disappearance in the first place. Gone Girl is coming out in October, and if this trailer is any sign, it may well be Fincher's next great thriller.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1\nThe next Hunger Games film arrives in November, and Lionsgate has been teasing them with some strange addresses from President Snow. This second address was released earlier this week .\nThe Zero Theorem\nTerry Gilliam's latest film looks to be wonderfully grand and as strange as ever . The Zero Theorem will be released on demand on August 19th and in theaters exactly one month later.\nExodus: Gods and Kings\nRidley Scott\u2019s next film is a biblical epic starring Christian Bale as Moses. What\u2019s not to like? Exodus: Gods and Kings will be released in December, and it looks like it\u2019ll easily live up to its status as an epic.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Before I Go To Sleep,' 'Unbroken,' 'Sharknado 2,' and 'Starred Up' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
