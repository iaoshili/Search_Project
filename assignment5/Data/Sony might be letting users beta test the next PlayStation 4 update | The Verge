{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSony is working on the PlayStation 4's next software update, and for the first time it looks like some users will get a chance to try it out before the company pushes it to everyone. According to an alleged screenshot of an email from Sony that Polygon received, some participants in the PlayStation MVP ambassador program can opt-in to beta test version 2.50 of the PS4 software. Those eligible to try it out will receive a message via the PlayStation Network and will get a voucher to download the new software that lasts through March 9th.\nThe software update reportedly contains at least one big feature of note \u2014 users will be able to put the PS4 in its low-power \"rest mode\" without terminating games or apps. So if you're in the middle of a game but know you won't be able to get back to it for a while, you can still power down your PS4 and pick up right where you left off.\nSony appears to be following in Microsoft's footprints, albeit in a slightly more limited fashion. Just over a year ago, Microsoft  rolled out a program that selected Xbox One owners at random to beta test upcoming software updates. While Sony is only pulling potential beta testers in from the population of PlayStation MVPs, Microsoft can call on anyone who uses the Xbox One. The company also  recently added this feature to the Xbox 360 , even though it's now nearly 10 years old.\nThere's no word yet on when the next PlayStation 4 software update will go live, but it'll likely be sometime this spring based on this potential beta test.\nUpdate, 5:40PM ET: Clarified and corrected details regarding Microsoft's preview program.\n","Title":"Sony might be letting users beta test the next PlayStation 4 update | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","tech"]}
