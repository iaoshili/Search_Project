We also get a ton of gadgets sent to our office, so consider this the best place for us to tell you about them and where you can find them \u2014 sometimes even for cheap.\nStar Wars gingerbread cookie cutters ($9)\nWe're now less than a year away from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but the wait is probably going to feel like an eternity for most fans. So what better way to bide your time than to eat your feelings after making some Star Wars gingerbread cookies with these cookie cutters? There are six different characters, though they're a bit random \u2014 no Luke, Leia, or Han. You do get Darth Vader and Boba Fett, as well as Chewbacca and C-3P0, so you can reenact some choice scenes from Empire before you chow down.\nStar Wars gingerbread cookie cutters at ThinkGeek ($9)\nCivilization: Beyond Earth ($29)\nWe learn more and more about space every year, but we are still so far away from being able to truly explore it in person. Luckily, the newest entry in the beloved Civilization series lets you do just that. It's full of that same great strategic gaming that Sid Meier's other titles are known for, but with an interstellar twist. We named it one of our best games of 2014 , and you can grab a copy today on Steam for 40 percent off.\nCivilization: Beyond Earth on Steam ($29)\nSandisk Ultra Dual USB Drive 32GB ($18)\nFile-sharing services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and even Airdrop are making it easier and easier to move files to or from your computer. That means the prices of USB drives \u2014 which were already dropping \u2014 are really starting to hit rock bottom. If you're still in need of ultra-portable physical file storage, this Sandisk USB drive is a steal. The real bonus is the microUSB port, which lets you plug right into your Android phone.\n32GB Sandisk Ultra Dual USB Drive at Newegg ($18)\nLogitech UE Mini Boom ($69)\nThe Bluetooth speaker market is booming, which means that not only are they becoming affordable but they're starting to sound really good, too. Stop putting your phone in a bowl and consider buying the UE Mini Boom instead. It wasn't our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker \u2014 that was the Mini's big brother, the UE Boom \u2014 but it's the best one you can buy for under $100. It's loud, the battery will last you for 10 hours, and it comes in some crazy colors.\nUE Mini Boom at Amazon ($69)\nAnkr 60W 6-port USB charger ($35)\nThink of how many devices you have that can be charged via USB. Now think about how many USB ports your laptop has \u2014 something's not right here. This 6-port charger is one of the most popular solutions around our office for this problem, and on the road, it's a live-saver. When we were in Maine shooting with the BMW i8 , our hotel lacked outlets to an unsafe degree, but this thing kept us fully charged and ready to go.\n","Title":"Price Check: Logitech's colorful speaker, Star Wars cookies, and interstellar gaming | The Verge","Tags":["good-deals","tech"]}
