{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMatters just keep getting worse for Sony Pictures, which was  victim to a massive hack this past week. Its internal email systems remain offline, and now DVD-quality rips of four of the studio's newest films have hit piracy websites.\nWatermarked copies of Fury, Annie, Mr. Turner, and Still Alice all hit torrent websites around the same time shortly after the attack. There's no confirmation that the films were indeed obtained from the attack, but it appears likely as DVDs of the films are not available for sale \u2014 indeed, all of the films other than Fury have yet to be released in theaters. The copies are believed to be DVD screeners, which are used by studios to distribute new films to awards judges and others for promotional purposes.\nAccording to TorrentFreak , Fury is by far the most popular of the leaked films \u2014 it's said to be the second most downloaded film on The Pirate Bay currently. In a statement, a Sony Pictures representative didn't confirm that the videos came from the leak, but did say \"the theft of Sony Pictures Entertainment content is a criminal matter, and we are working closely with law enforcement to address it.\" Authorities  arrested two people in London earlier this week in connection with the leak of The Expendables 3, which hit the internet before its theatrical release as well.\n","Title":"DVD rips of 'Fury,' 'Annie,' 'Mr. Turner,' and 'Still Alice' hit the web following Sony Pictures hack | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
