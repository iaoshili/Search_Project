{"Main text":"Sci-fi writers imagined the Ukraine conflict that they're now fighting in\nLife imitates art\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe idea of a modern conflict between pro-Russian and pro-Western forces has appeared in numerous works of speculative fiction over the years, namely in the video game series  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare , and before that in the lesser-known game  Lock On: Modern Air Combat . But the current, real-life conflict in the Ukraine and Crimea is even more eerily reminiscent of recent sci-fi books written by Russian and Ukrainian authors.\nAs  Cathy Young explains in vivid detail over at  Slate , numerous sci-fi novels published in the early 2000s \u2014 War 2010: The Ukrainian Front, War 2011: Against NATO, Omega, Battlefield Ukraine: The Broken Trident, among them \u2014 describe scenarios in which Ukraine becomes a battleground between Russian separatists and Ukraine nationalists backed by the US and NATO. Several authors of those books, most notably Fedor Berezin (of War 2010 and War 2011), have since gone on to play active roles in the conflict itself, with Berezin aggressively propagandizing on behalf of Russian separatists in Ukraine. How the conflict evolves remains to be seen, but some critics accuse the sci-fi writers of creating a fertile environment for the conflict to take root in the first place. In any case, it's a particularly worrisome example of life imitating art more than the other way around.\n","Title":"Sci-fi writers imagined the Ukraine conflict that they're now fighting in | The Verge","Tags":["tldr","us-world"]}
