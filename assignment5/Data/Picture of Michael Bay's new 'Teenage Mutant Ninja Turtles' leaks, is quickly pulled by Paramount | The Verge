{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf Transformers wasn't enough, Michael Bay is also bringing another childhood classic to the big screen with the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \u2014 and now we finally have a glimpse at what the heroes in a half shell will look like. ComicBookMovie has posted a series of leaked images that it claims come from a person \"close to the production,\" which showcase not only the turtles but armored villain Shredder as well. The turtles themselves look sort of like beefed up versions of their counterparts from the original 1990 TMNT live-action film, complete with ragged clothing and body armor.\nParamount Pictures sent us a takedown request, but you can still see some of the images here .\n\"I do want this to be authentic.\"\nThe Bay-produced reboot is slated to launch this August, and will see him working with at least one familiar face \u2014 Transformers star Megan Fox will be taking the role of reporter April O'Neil. Jonathan Liebesman will be serving as director. There has also been some controversy with regards to just how faithful the adaptation will be, particularly when it comes to the turtles' origin story. At one point Bay suggested that the heroes would be aliens, as opposed to mutant turtles, though he has since backtracked. \"I do listen to the fans and I do want this to be authentic,\" he told MovieFone in April .\nUnfortunately these leaked photos are the first we've seen of Bay's interpretation of the turtles, but with the summer release quickly approaching it likely won't be long before there's something a bit more official.\n","Title":"Picture of Michael Bay's new 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' leaks, is quickly pulled by Paramount | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
