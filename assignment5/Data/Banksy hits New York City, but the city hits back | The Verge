Since October 1st, he's created upwards of 10 pieces as part of his monthlong \"residency\" (to borrow a term from the professional art world), titled \" Better Out Than In .\" Banksy's playful work often offers social or political commentary, and he hasn't limited himself to sidewalks and walls in New York \u2014 he's already created two mobile pieces on trucks . Many of the New York pieces include mock audio guides that poke fun at the recorded messages offered to museum-goers, which are also available online.\nBanksy's work by its very nature is ephemeral \u2014 property owners often paint over it, or opportunistic looters extract it from the streets and sell it for vast sums, sometimes even chiseling it out of exterior walls. The short shelf-life of Banksy's work has never been more visible than here in New York. A little less than halfway through his tour of the Big Apple, local graffiti artists and property owners have already altered his first few pieces dramatically with their own marks. See the biggest transformations below. \u2014 Photography by William Mansell and Sam Sheffer.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Banksy hits New York City, but the city hits back | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","design"]}
