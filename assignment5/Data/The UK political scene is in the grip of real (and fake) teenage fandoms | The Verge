{"Main text":"\u2014 deni (@madsmikklsen) April 20, 2015\nAre the #milifans serious? Are they joking? It's hard to say \u2014 teenagers are better at irony than pretty much everyone, and this is doubly true for teenagers on social media. The digital media scene in the UK is fairly close-knit however, and more than a few definitely-not-teenagers have jumped on the bandwagon. However, the meme's unofficial spokesperson Abby seems to genuinely support of Miliband's Labour Party, and tweets as much praise  about his political policies as she does fandom-themed messages.\nTeenagers are better at irony than everyone\nIn an interview  with The Guardian , she insisted that the whole thing is not \"tongue-in-cheek\" and that the meme is simply a result of young people's anger and frustration at the political situation in the UK. \"It is just young people angry that they can\u2019t vote. [Conservative prime minister] David Cameron won\u2019t give us a voice, so we are having our say anyway.\" As a 17-year-old, Abby is too young to vote, although Miliband himself has stepped into the fray to  thank her for her support .\n\u2014 Alison (@alisonfilly) April 19, 2015\nHowever, the whole political-fandom-meme looks close to being over just days after it began. This morning, the Conservative-supporting newspaper The Telegraph wrote up a  supposed rival-fandom called the #cameronettes . The article seemed to be mostly about political point-scoring, with  a now-deleted subheadline declaring without irony that the #milifandom \"[risked] being overshadowed by growing Twitter love for David Cameron.\"\nAs you might expect \u2014 and as The Telegraph itself acknowledges \u2014 the #cameronette \"teenage fanclub\" is actually the work of a 21-year-old Conservative supporter who started it as a \"joke.\" (Although the most recent message still reads: \"PLEASE STOP ALL THE HATE. IM 13 IM NOT DAVID CAMERON OR ANY OTHER POLITIC PERSON. OKAY?\") But so far the account has attracted just over 100 followers and approximately zero laughs, proving that making jokes about political fandom isn't enough \u2014 you have to mean it, too.\n","Title":"The UK political scene is in the grip of real (and fake) teenage fandoms | The Verge","Tags":["web","culture","tldr","us-world"]}
