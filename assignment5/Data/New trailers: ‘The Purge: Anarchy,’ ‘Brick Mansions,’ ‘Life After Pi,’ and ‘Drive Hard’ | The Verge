{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's Valentine's Day weekend, which obviously means it's time to head to your local theater to watch crime-hunting cyborgs . If for some reason that doesn't fit into your plans, however, there are always new options on the horizon \u2014 so let's take a look at some of the latest trailers to make the rounds.\nThe Purge: Anarchy\nLast year The Purge took a fantastic conceit \u2014 a US that had stopped crime by letting citizens act out their collective rage during one night of total lawlessness \u2014 and paired it with a home invasion story. While the film wasn\u2019t the thriller we\u2019d hoped for , it performed well enough to warrant a sequel. This new installment takes a much more straightforward approach than its predecessor, but the doesn't make the masks any less creepy.\nBrick Mansions\nPaul Walker filmed this action thriller before his tragic death last year. A remake of the French film District 13, it's heavy on the use of Parkour \u2014 which means Mansions will have all the spinning, running, and wall-jumping that you could possibly ask for.\nLife After Pi\nAt the Oscars last year Life of Pi took home the award for best visual effects, but when the staff of vfx house Rhythm & Hues tried to use the opportunity to warn of business problems the effects industry is facing they were cut short . Life After Pi takes a look at the company \u2014 which was eventually acquired \u2014 as part of a larger examination of the US film industry.\nDrive Hard\nIn this action comedy John Cusack really likes e-cigs while Thomas Jane hides behind some sketchy hair and a pair of sunglasses. Is this real? Is it satire? With a name like Drive Hard, does it matter?\n","Title":"New trailers: \u2018The Purge: Anarchy,\u2019 \u2018Brick Mansions,\u2019 \u2018Life After Pi,\u2019 and \u2018Drive Hard\u2019 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment"]}
