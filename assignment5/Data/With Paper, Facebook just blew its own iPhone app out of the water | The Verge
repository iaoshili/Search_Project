{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis morning, Facebook is announcing a new standalone iPhone app calledÂ  Paper . Contrary to earlier rumors , it's much more than just a news-reading app \u2014 it's a complete reimagining of Facebook itself. Once you've used it, you may never want to open the standard Facebook app again. It may not replicated every feature of Facebook's main app, but it does fulfill the majority of people's needs. Simply put, it's much, much better.\nPaper takes the standard Facebook News Feed and recreates it as an immersive, horizontally scrolling set of screens. It also provides a new way to post to Facebook (and Paper) with an elegant WYSIWYG editor that borrows the styling of Medium 's and Svbltle 's blogging systems. Finally, yes, it's a news-reading app that owes some of its looks to Flipboard. It will be available for the iPhone in the US (and only the iPhone in the US) on February 3rd. It's also ad-free, at least for now.\nThat's all more than we were expecting when we sat down with product designer Mike Matas and product manager Michael Reckhow. Neither would quite take the bait when asked whether this should serve as a replacement for the original Facebook app (or, as I put it during our interview, a virtual indictment). Reckhow says that there are \"tools that were out there for sharing high-quality stuff and also the tools where you could reach an audience,\" but that too often they aren't the same thing. \"We felt you shouldn't have to choose between one or the other,\" he says.\nGoodbye buttons, hello swipes\nPaper cuts away virtually all buttons and other UI elements to make every status update, photo, and news story appear full-screen. To get around, you will need to learn a basic set of gestures, but the app will gently remind you what they are if it thinks you're stuck. Wide photos pan as you tilt the phone (the team cheekily calls it the \"Ken turns\" effect), UI elements often just fade away, and news stories are presented in Twitter-esque cards.\nThe lack of chrome to help place you in the app and tell you how to navigate can be a little disorienting. On the bright side, the UI is fast and fluid, thanks to the nine months the team has spent working on the app. Loren Brichter, the creator of Letterpress and Tweetie , also chipped in on the coding. The result is an app that shares a family resemblance to Facebook Home on Android , but is much faster and more full-featured.\nEach section in Paper has a main screen with a cover photo and a list of small cards at the bottom. You can scroll through or drill into the cards, at which point you'll be swiping through one card at a time. Matas hopes that you'll flip through slowly. \"You really want people to spend a little bit of time with it and appreciate that content,\" Matas says, \"almost like when you go to a museum and you spend a little bit of time with each thing.\"\nA lean-back experience, but on a tiny screen\nIf you aren't put off by the idea of considering a photo of your friend's dog an art piece, you might call it a lean-back experience (albeit on a tiny screen). As a UI philosophy, this stands in direct opposition to the high-volume, high-noise vertical feeds we're used to on Twitter and  Facebook. It definitely means it will take longer to grind through content like you can on Twitter \u2014 but for Facebook, that's exactly the point. If, like me, you're a news addict and an information fiend, Paper may be a little too relaxed for you.\nThe interface for news reading is exactly the same, with the exception that links are automatically turned into small, Twitter-esque media cards with branding from the publication. Swiping up to read the full story takes you to the source site \u2014 there's no offline mode like you might find in a more full featured news app. You also can't add any site you want, as with a traditional RSS reader. Instead, Facebook has hired a team of content curators to pick stories for you in one of a dozen or so categories ranging from basic news to cute animals.\nYou can post to Paper (and thus Facebook) in a new kind of compose screen. It shows you exactly what the final post will look like, and Reckhow isn't shy about his hope that people will think of Paper as a new kind of thing \u2014 even though the plumbing underneath is still Facebook. \"Think about when Instagram came out and you now had this new way to share,\" he says. Facebook\u2019s ambition with Paper is to have it become its own thing, not just a different way of accessing Facebook. Matas goes so far as to say that \"it\u2019s a publishing tool, a way of publishing great content, and a way of viewing great content.\"\nPaper is the first product to come out of Facebook Creative Labs, a unit within the company tasked to \"innovate and build new things,\" as Reckhow puts it. That's likely a sign that Paper will be just one of what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called \"new and engaging types of mobile experiences\" on yesterday\u2019s earnings call . Since its embarrassing Snapchat clone called Poke failed, Facebook seems closer to figuring out the right formula for its single-use apps . Facebook knows that mobile users are gravitating towards such apps, and it intends to create more of them .\nFacebook wants another spot on your home screen, and another one after that\nThat\u2019s probably a good thing, and perhaps a necessary one. From a user's perspective, Facebook\u2019s current app is beset by dozens of options, nooks, crannies, and features that most people don\u2019t really use. The recent \"tab-centric\" redesign helped simplify things, but it wasn\u2019t radical change. Facebook has a billion users, and so any alterations it wants to make to its core app need to be tested \u2014 extensively. That kind of testing can get in the way of creative design. \"You can\u2019t be innovative if you\u2019re encumbered by worrying if you\u2019re going to disrupt what hundreds of millions or a billion people are doing,\" Reckhow says.\nThe team wanted \"to have the creative freedom to go outside of what we\u2019ve done and not worry about if it\u2019s going to impact metrics [on] day one.\" For Reckhow, Matas, and the rest of the team, Paper is less a replacement for Facebook\u2019s app than a chance for the company to try out something very different from what it\u2019s done before \u2014 and get another icon on your iPhone\u2019s home screen in the process.\nIf Paper does score a slot on your main home screen, another app will probably have to be buried away somewhere else. For a lot of people, Facebook itself will be a prime candidate.\n","Title":"With Paper, Facebook just blew its own iPhone app out of the water | The Verge","Tags":["web","apps","report","design","tech"]}
