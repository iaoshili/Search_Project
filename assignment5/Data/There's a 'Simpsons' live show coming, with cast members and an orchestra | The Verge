{"Main text":"There's a 'Simpsons' live show coming, with cast members and an orchestra\n'The Simpsons Take the Bowl' will hit the Hollywood Bowl in September\nThe Simpsons has become a cultural monolith since it first aired 25 seasons ago (and counting). Now it's getting a live show befitting of its stature.\nThe production will feature never-before-seen clips\nFor three days in September, the Hollywood Bowl will stage  The Simpsons Take the Bowl , a live production complete with cast members, and an accompanying orchestra. The live show will be hosted by Hank Azaria, the voice of several Springfield inhabitants, with appearances from Nancy Cartwright (Bart) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa). Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, will also perform, giving the audience anecdotes about working on the series as guests like Weird Al drift on and off stage. Most importantly for aficionados of the series, the show will feature never-before-seen clips.\nThe live show sounds more like a revival for a long-canceled series than a party for one still on the air. But, then again, The Simpsons has long claimed its place in television history.
