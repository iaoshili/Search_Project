{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nChinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has invested $590 million for a part of domestic smartphone manufacturer Meizu. The unspecified stake gives the internet giant a foothold in hardware for its smartphone operating system YunOS \u2014 best known previously as an iOS-clone \u2014 but the company faces serious competition from domestic and international rivals trying to tap the country's growing number of mobile internet users.\nChina has 557 million mobile internet users\nAlthough internet penetration is still under 50 percent in China, the country already has 649 million web users \u2014  86 percent of whom are logging on with smartphones and tablets. Chinese internet giants like search company Baidu and gaming-and-chat firm Tencent have already made the move to mobile, while a clutch of domestic smartphone manufacturers including Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi are battling it out with multinational companies like Samsung and Apple to sell the actual hardware. Together, these five brands account for 60 percent of China\u2019s smartphone market.\nMeizu, by comparison, has  less than a 2 percent market share , but has grown its manufacturing output from a few hundred thousand units in previous years to close to 2 million in the last three months of 2014. It\u2019s a relatively small base for Alibaba to break into the world\u2019s largest smartphone market with, but it doesn\u2019t have much of a choice. Google has  previously forced manufacturers to drop Alibaba\u2019s YunOS, with the US company protesting that the software is based on its own Android mobile OS but is not compatible with the wider Android ecosystem. Alibaba, meanwhile, maintains that YunOS is not a version of Android at all.\nAlibaba doesn't just need to attract mobile users \u2014 it needs to make money off them\nWhatever the case may be, Chinese mobile users can expect to see more of YunOS in the near future. Alibaba, meanwhile, has more immediate problems to deal with. Although the company says that mobile sales accounted for  42 percent of its business last quarter, its mobile ad revenue was less than 2 percent \u2014 below analysts' estimates. The company can fight for all the mobile users it likes, but market share won't matter until customers start paying out.\n","Title":"Alibaba fights for smartphone users in China with $590m stake in Meizu | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","business","tech"]}
