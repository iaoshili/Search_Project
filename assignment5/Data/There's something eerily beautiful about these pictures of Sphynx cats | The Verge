{"Main text":"There's something eerily beautiful about these pictures of Sphynx cats\nWeird-lookin' critters\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI sometimes google pictures of baby wombats , just because I can. I could watch videos of naked mole rats scurrying around for hours. Between the ages of five and 21, I was convinced that I would study snakes for the rest of my life, and I think Indian purple frogs are downright adorable. In short, I like weird-looking critters. It's a thing.\nSo, it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise that I think these Sphynx pictures are the cat's meow (sorry). To satisfy my curiosity about how these came to be, I got in touch with the photographer \u2014  Alicia Rius \u2014 to ask her a few questions about the project. The following is a lightly edited transcript of that conversation.\nArielle Duhaime-Ross: Why did you decide do to take these photographs?\nAlicia Rius: So, the first time I saw a Sphynx cat I thought \"what is this?\" I was mesmerized. It was so weird, I could feel the folds and the skin \u2014 everything. It was like a raw cat. And I\u2019ve always liked weird things. They just draw you in.\n\"Like a Raw Cat.\"\nSo when I saw the Sphynx cat for the first time, about three years ago, I lost it. It was something beautiful and awkward and rare. I became a bit obsessive. I started looking for Sphynx cats in San Francisco. Eventually, I met a woman through a friend who had two cats, and I photographed them. And that was it!\nA lot of people have photographed Sphynx cats, but no one has created a body of work around them. I decided that I was going to really explore this. That\u2019s when I started to contact cat owners through Facebook and Craigslist, just asking around if they had Sphynx cats that I could photograph. I wanted to photograph their anatomy, the way they move, how they behave when their body is exposed. Their armpit, you know... they look like a bat. And when you look at the paws, you can\u2019t really see what animal it is. They\u2019re just so different.\nI also have a weird fascination with animals that are awkward and strange. And these pictures are really striking; I\u2019ve never seen this breed pictured in quite this way.\nThat\u2019s the thing \u2014 the more I photograph them, the more I notice their bodies. It\u2019s funny because at some point, because of the way they move, I stop seeing a cat, and I just see abstract figures that are very interesting. The way they lick the paws... depending on my point of view, I just see a figure that\u2019s attracting me.\nHow have people reacted to this project, so far? Has the reaction been surprising?\nNot very surprising. They\u2019re beautiful to me. So what I wanted to share with people is that within that ugliness, there is a beauty factor. It\u2019s in their stoic figure, the beautiful profile, the bones, and the muscles. But people are very radical. They either love it or hate it.\n\"portraying them in a very aggressive manner.\"\nSome people feel that the photos are beautiful and interesting, but when I ask them, \"Would you handle a Sphynx cat?,\" they say \"No!\" Others say \"Yes, now that I see these pictures, I probably would.\" The reactions tend to be extreme.\nThat makes sense to me.\nYou know, I\u2019ve read some funny posts where people have said that they look like the devil\u2019s spawn [in my pictures]. And it\u2019s true. I have been portraying them in a very aggressive manner.\nHowever, they are so playful and joyful. They are the friendliest cats ever. They just want to be with you, jump around you. Of course, they are seeking the heat of your body because they\u2019re naked, and they like to be very active with you so they can keep warm. But the difference between these cats and others breeds\u2026 So far, I\u2019ve found that these cats are very loving creatures. They really want to cuddle you. It\u2019s a good example that shows that looks can be deceiving.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"There's something eerily beautiful about these pictures of Sphynx cats | The Verge","Tags":["photography","culture","interview","tldr","photo-essay","tech"]}
