{"Main text":"Report\nMeet the US Senate's most important anti-environmentalist\nJames Inhofe believes climate change is a hoax; he even wrote a book saying so. What does Inhofe actually think, and what will it mean for the future?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIn 2003, Senator James Inhofe (R-OK) and then-chair of the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, took to the Senate floor and asked, \u201CWith all of the hysteria, all of the fear, all of the phony science, could it be that man-made global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people?\u201D More than 10 years of science has been completed since Inhofe first posed his question. Nearly all of it shows climate change is definitely not a hoax. That hasn\u2019t stopped Sen. Inhofe and other conservative politicians from waging a crusade against climate policy and science.\nThe Senate changes hands\nGlobal average temperature anomaly since 1880, compared to the average temperature from 1901 to 2000. ( NOAA ).\nRepublicans took back the Senate in the November elections. That means Inhofe is headed back to the EPW chairmanship after a seven-year absence. He\u2019s promised to use his position to stop environmental legislation in its tracks and rein in the Environmental Protection Agency. His tenure comes as the EPA gets ready to implement some of the most sweeping environmental regulations of the past several decades , and as world leaders are gearing up to meet in Paris next year to come to a global agreement to respond to climate change.\nEnvironmental safeguards are difficult to pass even with Democrats controlling the Senate and the Executive Branch. Take the \"Cromnibus;\" the bill cut EPA spending by $60 million , down to $8.1 billion. It\u2019s the fourth year in a row Congress has cut EPA funding, from a high of $10.2 billion in 2010. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the Cromnibus will prevent restrictions on oil development, which threatens the endangered sage grouse, and contains another provision that could make it harder for the EPA to enforce Clean Water Act on farms.\nHow bad could the next few years be? Sen. Inhofe lays out exactly what he believes in his 2012 book The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future. The book makes it clear that the next few years will be challenging ones for people who care about the environment. The gist of Inhofe\u2019s argument is this: Anthropogenic climate change is either not real or greatly exaggerated, and those who insist it\u2019s real are doing so to control American lives.\nThe gist of inhofe's argument is this: human-caused climate change isn't real\n\"Why, when the United Nations IPCC is totally refuted\u2026When Al Gore is totally discredited\u2026When man-made global warming is totally debunked\u2026When passing a global warming cap and trade is totally futile\u2026Why is this book necessary?,\" Inhofe writes \u2014ellipses his. \"Very simple: the environmental activist extremists are not going away.\"\nThe global warming conspiracy continues today because, Inhofe writes, \"the media is obsessed with resurrecting the Gore mantra, and two, MoveOn.org, George Soros, Michael Moore, and the Hollywood elites have the resources to reverse the defeat.\"\nMany of Inhofe\u2019s assertions are not cited \u2014 of the book\u2019s 408 citations, only five directly reference scientific journals.  Rather, Inhofe counters scientific research he doesn\u2019t like with his own opinions. In one instance, he attempts to paint climate scientists as bullies who want to silence any critics of global warming science by telling the story of David Deming, an oft-cited climate change-denying geophysicist who believes a brief period of warmer temperatures around 1000 AD, called the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), disproves that the warm temperatures today are caused by humans. Deming has said that bullying climate scientists have tried to force him to \"get rid of that Medieval Warm Period.\"\nDeming is wrong about the MWP. A preponderance of evidence suggests the earth was warmer in some places then, but is overall much warmer now. On top of that, proving the earth was slightly warmer doesn\u2019t disprove the climate change happening now. There\u2019s also no evidence to suggest a scientist ever told Deming to \"get rid of\" the MWP.\n\"When you backtrack, trying to find the proof, you find all these fantasies,\" says John Mashey, a computer scientist who studies climate change deniers and helps run the  website Skeptical Science .\nAugust 2014's global average surface temperature was the hottest since record-keeping began in 1880. Here's a map of temperature abnormalities during that time. ( NOAA )\nThe debate over a single chart\nThe red curve shows the global mean temperature from 1850 onward. The dark blue is the original \"hockey stick\" graph; the light blue is its uncertainty range. The green dots are from a separate study: the 30-year average of the PAGES-2K reconstruction of temperatures over the last 2000 years \u2014 the work of 78 researchers in 24 countries ( Klaus Bittermann )\nMisunderstanding of scientists\u2019 work is standard in Inhofe\u2019s book. For instance, Inhofe tries to debunk the hockey stick graph \u2014 a favorite target of climate skeptics. The graph , which details global average temperature over time, shows relatively minor fluctuations in temperature from 1000\u20131900, and then a spike in temperature coinciding with the Industrial Revolution. In his book, Inhofe called the hockey stick \"bad science.\" Most scientists don\u2019t agree.\nThe hockey stick graph first showed up in 1998 in a paper co-authored by climate scientist Michael Mann , then a researcher at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. For the paper, Mann and his colleagues had looked at tree rings, coral, ice cores, and other records that display past temperature variation. They found that while local temperatures fluctuated, the average global temperature was largely stable from the year 1000 until the 1900s.\nthe hockey stick graph has been reviewed several times for accuracy, and each time it's withstood the scrutiny\nMann is now a professor at Penn State University. He\u2019s has written a book about his experience of being pulled into the center of the climate change \"debates,\" largely thanks to Inhofe . Inhofe\u2019s skepticism actually made Mann\u2019s case stronger, Mann says. Mann\u2019s graph has been reviewed several times for accuracy, including by the National Academy of Sciences, and each time, the basic tenant of the graph \u2014 that the world is hotter now than at any time in the past thousand years \u2014 has withstood the scrutiny.\n\"It\u2019s been combed over more times than any other piece of climate data, probably ever,\" says Jeremy Shakun, a climate researcher and professor at Boston College. His research suggests the world is actually warmer now than it has been for much longer than 1000 years. \"We\u2019re still nerding out over some small points, but we\u2019re several years past there being any real doubt.\"\nThere are several more erroneous claims in Inhofe\u2019s book. But perhaps the biggest failure of Inhofe\u2019s argument about climate change isn\u2019t about one specific study or point of contention. He just doesn\u2019t understand the scientific process. Good science builds clarity through consensus; an individual study matters, but a body of research can\u2019t be rebutted with one or two contradictory studies.\nthe vast majority of scientists agree that the climate is changing rapidly\nThere are some well-reviewed studies that question the specifics of the hockey stick and other pieces of the global warming puzzle. There are some scientists who question whether the dire predictions about the effects of global warming are accurate. But the vast majority of scientists agree the climate is changing rapidly. One review of 12,000 peer-reviewed abstracts found that in 97 percent of papers where the researchers took a position on the cause of global warming, researchers blamed humans for contributing to it. Shakun says scientists are \"towards Darwin- and evolution-certain\" that climate change is real and humans are causing it.\nThe rest of Inhofe\u2019s book isn\u2019t about science at all. After devoting a couple-dozen pages to attempting to debunk the hockey stick and the MWP, Inhofe moves on to attacking the people behind the push to act on global warming.\nInhofe has remained defiant about his views on climate change in interviews and Senate hearings; he\u2019s still using faulty information to back up his views. Asked via email whether his views on climate change pose a conflict of interest for his upcoming role as chairman of the EPW, Inhofe replied: \"There is no conflict in defending the American people from costly regulations brought on by advocates of man-made climate change. Over the past 15 years, the earth has not warmed yet CO2 emissions have continued to increase.\"\nThat claim is accurate, but only because Inhofe uses 1998 as a start date. The year\u2019s an outlier \u2014 1998 was unusually warm because of a particularly strong El Niño. But even without El Niño, a brief warming plateau wouldn\u2019t disprove that climate change is real; a dataset that starts in 1998 is too small to be useful.\nFollow the money\nInhofe is funded by industries that have vested interests in ignoring the push for a greener future. \"Far from being a friend of Big Oil, as the accusation is often levied against me, I am a friend of 'Little Oil' or of any Oklahomans who strive to develop our vast resources,\" he wrote in The Greatest Hoax.\nin total, energy companies have donated almost $3 million to inhofe\nOne of Inhofe\u2019s major contributors is Koch Industries, which is a family-owned business that says its annual revenue is $115 billion . Koch, which owns oil, gas, and coal infrastructure across the world, has donated $101,000 to Inhofe . In total, energy companies have donated almost $3 million to Inhofe , more than any other industry. Even during uncompetitive years, Inhofe\u2019s campaign raised hundreds of thousands from oil companies .\nEnergy money coats all of Congress. Each dollar oil, gas, and coal companies spend on a politician buys the companies $59 in subsidies, according to one estimate The controversy over that pay-for-play system has led most members of the Senate to try to downplay their connections to the industry. Inhofe announces his influences with pride.\n\"I firmly believe in pursuing policy options to foster an environment of economic growth and opportunity as well as to become energy independent,\" Inhofe writes in his emailed response.\nSage grouse ( Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service )\nBut there\u2019s hope. Over the past few years, organizations not usually associated with liberal ideology or environmental activism \u2014 the Pentagon , the Vatican, ExxonMobil \u2014 have acknowledged the existence of climate change and humans\u2019 contribution to it. Even the sage grouse may benefit from energy companies\u2019 largesse , but even if every politician acknowledged that climate change existed, doing something about it in the near future seems less than likely. Congress hasn\u2019t passed a major piece of environmental legislation since it strengthened the  Clean Air Act in 1990. All other legislation since then has been incremental or pushed through by the Executive Branch.\nInhofe has been instrumental in that blockade. Last month, Inhofe demanded the EPA stop looking into whether states have effectively prevented fracking from causing damage to water systems. In 2012, he sponsored a bill that would have stripped the EPA\u2019s ability to force coal power plants to reduce the amount of mercury and other toxic substances they emit. One of Inhofe\u2019s only pushes for environmental legislation was 2003\u2019s Clear Skies Act , which Inhofe touts in his book as \"the most aggressive\" environmental legislation in history. But according to environmental groups , the specifics of the bill would have actually let power plants emit more toxic substances, and would have gutted the EPA\u2019s authority under the Clean Air Act. The League of Conservation Voters calculates that Inhofe has only voted in favor of environmental legislation 5 percent of the time .\ninhofe has only voted in favor of environmental regulation 5 percent of the time\nThere\u2019s a section at the end of Inhofe\u2019s book in which he recounts becoming \"deathly ill\" after swimming in a lake polluted with blue-green algae in Oklahoma. The toxins blue-green algae carries can kill you if you drink enough of it. A few months ago, Toledo, Ohio shut of its water supply because the algae had migrated down from Lake Erie.\nBlue-green algae is proliferating across the US because of climate change . It\u2019s not clear why Inhofe includes the story; he doesn\u2019t use it to refute a point about climate change or to prove something about his policies. Maybe it\u2019s a parable: nature can kill you, no matter what you believe.\n","Title":"Meet the US Senate's most important anti-environmentalist | The Verge","Tags":["policy","report","science","us-world"]}
