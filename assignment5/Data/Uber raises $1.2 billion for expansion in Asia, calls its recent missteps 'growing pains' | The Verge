{"Main text":"Uber raises $1.2 billion for expansion in Asia, calls its recent missteps 'growing pains'\nThe company continues fundraising for its aggressive global rollout\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nUber announced today that it was raising another $1.2 billion in venture capital, meaning it has raised a whopping $2.7 billion in total. The company has been able to find such willing investors because  it's shown staggering growth , on pace to generate $2 billion in annual revenue. The new round reportedly values Uber at roughly $40 billion. That's a staggering appreciation over the last few years. As tech investor Semil Shah pointed out on Twitter:\nNot accounting for dilution, $10,000 invested in Uber\u2019s $1.2m seed round ($5m value) now worth $80m. (Again, NOT accounting for dilution!)\n\u2014 Semil (@semil) December 4, 2014\nThe company has also been the focus of a lot of negative press. Some has focused on the  aggressive promises it makes to its drivers around their potential salaries, or the way it encourages them to take out  sub-prime auto loans . Others have questioned their  partnership with military vets and attempts to  sabotage its competitors . There was also the suggestion by company executive Emil Michaels that Uber should look into doing  opposition research on journalists who produced negative coverage of Uber.\nIn announcing the new financing, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wrote that:\nThis kind of growth has also come with significant growing pains. The events of the recent weeks have shown us that we also need to invest in internal growth and change. Acknowledging mistakes and learning from them are the first steps. We are collaborating across the company and seeking counsel from those who have gone through similar challenges to allow us to refine and change where needed.Fortunately, taking swift action is where Uber shines, and we will be making changes in the months ahead. Done right, it will lead to a smarter and more humble company that sets new standards in data privacy, gives back more to the cities we serve and defines and refines our company culture effectively.\n","Title":"Uber raises $1.2 billion for expansion in Asia, calls its recent missteps 'growing pains' | The Verge","Tags":["business","tech"]}
