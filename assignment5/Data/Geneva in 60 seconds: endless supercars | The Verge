It's full of super expensive, scarcely attainable cars, but just getting there is enough to bankrupt you (now that the Swiss franc has shot up in value).\nStill, looking at all those shiny new motors doesn't cost anything, and my time spent inside the Palexpo venue was indeed a visual delight. Hell, even before I could walk in, there was a big, bright yellow Mercedes 4x4 stood atop a massive vertical platform showing off its mountain-climbing capabilities. It was a crazy show, it was a beautiful show, and it featured even more supercars than usual. Check out all our coverage below.\nAston Martin Vulcan and DBX\nThe cars that Aston Martin brought to Geneva this year really couldn't have been more different. One is the most extreme supercar the company has ever produced; the other is an electric GT that looks to the future of mainstream luxury.\nKoenigsegg Regera\nIf Geneva was a kingdom, the Regera would most certainly be king (in fact, the name literally means \"to reign\" in Swedish). Christian von Koenigsegg's latest hypercar features a symphony of gas and elecric motors delivering around 1,500 horespower, far more than any human could ever need.\nBugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse La Finale\nThe very final Veyron, only the 450th ever made, has been sold, marking the conclusion of a glorious production run that's given us the fastest supercar in the world.\nBentley EXP 10 Speed 6\nSome are calling Bentley's curvy EXP 10 Speed 6 concept the winner among Volkswagen Group's many announcements here in Geneva this year, if not the outright winner of the entire Geneva Motor Show. That may be a stretch \u2014 there are countless beautiful, nigh-unattainable cars here \u2014 but it's still pretty easy to make the argument.\nAudi R8 e-tron\nAudi has been experimenting with electrics under its e-tron brand for several years, but its latest \u2014 a bespoke version of the second-generation R8 supercar \u2014 takes things to an entirely different level.\nFerrari 488 GTB\nAs if the outgoing 458 Italia wasn't extreme enough, Ferrari has upped the ante with a revised version that features more speed, more acceleration, more horsepower, revised styling, and \u2014 here's the big one \u2014 turbocharging.\nLamborghini Aventador LP750-4 Superveloce\nNot every car makes logical sense; in fact, sometimes, it's the utter lack of logic in a vehicle that makes it so special. That's a fair way of looking at the Aventador Superveloce, an even more extreme version of Lamborghini's superlative flagship.\nnanoFlowCell Quant F\nThe Quant F is the latest concept from Liechtenstein's nanoFlowCell, a wicked fast oddity with gullwing doors that's powered by an unusual \"flow cell\" drivetrain. It's ecologically friendly and quicker than some of the world's best supercars, but the refueling infrastructure simply doesn't exist today.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nMercedes-Benz G500 4x4 concept\nPerched atop a 30-foot platform outside the entrance to the Geneva Motor Show, this Mercedes is designed specifically for the needs of wealthy customers in the Middle East, including special suspensions and dust-proofing for when you go off-roading in the desert.\n","Title":"Geneva in 60 seconds: endless supercars | The Verge","Tags":["videos","photo-essay","transportation\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7914268"]}
