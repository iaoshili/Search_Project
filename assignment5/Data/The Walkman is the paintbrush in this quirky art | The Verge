Yang created The Autonomous Machines Project by making a few simple additions to the mechanisms powering objects like a vacuum and a Walkman so they would produce art. It was an experiment in generative design, which explores how algorithms and computers can create endless variations in outcomes. There's no rhyme or reason that controls the mechanics of these objects, so each piece of art will always be different.\nYang has done this to a handful of objects, including a food chopper, a wind-up clock, and an electric razor. Rather than creating new algorithms, the project explores the internal algorithms the objects already possess, building upon them to let the objects make something new. You can see all of the videos and the art created on Yang's website .\nImages courtesy of Echo Yang\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nHalf of a bobbing chicken toy with a painted cotton swab attached to its back made this dotted burst of color.\nA Walkman spins to make delicate, ghostly circles.\nA vacuum cleaner created this design when filled with black calligraphy ink.\nA hand mixer attached with brush bristles and watercolors spins continuously without a pattern, painting feathery circles.\nAn electric razor is filled with black ink and makes caterpillar-like blobs on a canvas.\nPencil lead attached to a wind-up clock draws crazy patterns.\n","Title":"The Walkman is the paintbrush in this quirky art | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design"]}
