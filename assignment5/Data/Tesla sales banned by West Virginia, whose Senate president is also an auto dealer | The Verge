{"Main text":"Tesla sales banned by West Virginia, whose Senate president is also an auto dealer\nThe battle continues to play out across the US\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTesla CEO Elon Musk is all about disruption. That means electric cars instead of the more common gas guzzlers and direct sales in place of dealerships. Unfortunately for Musk, auto dealers are often a powerful political constituency, and have managed to get legislation passed in numerous states banning direct sales. Today, West Virginia joined that group, when Governor Ray Tomblin  signed into law a bill that prevents manufacturers from operating their own dealerships.\nSimilar laws have passed recently in New Jersey and  Michigan . The ban in New Jersey was  subsequently overturned . That was a big deal for Tesla, as the Garden State is one of the largest markets for the expensive cars it sells. West Virginia is a much smaller market, but it would have given Tesla access to customers in surrounding areas like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Washington, DC.\n\"I'm sorry \u2014 my electricity isn't free.\"\nTesla's direct sales are  currently banned in five states and under attack in court in another six. May other states are  rolling out proposed bills . It's worth pointing out that West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole is  apparently a long time auto dealer . He abstained from voting on this measure. Cole owns a Nissan dealership, and has some experience with Tesla customers.\n\"Nissan makes us put public charging stations outside our dealerships. So I've sold a couple of Leafs, and nobody uses them,\" Cole  told Auto News . \"But I have a guy who bought a Tesla that pulls up to my dealership every day and plugs right in because his office is close. I'm sorry \u2014 my electricity isn't free. But he doesn't have any problem pulling his Tesla into my Nissan store and laughing and leaving it on charge.\"\nGov. Tomblin had initially resisted the bill. \"One of my goals is to attract businesses or bring jobs into the state,\" he told The Washington Times. \"I have a lot of friends who are car dealers, and maybe they would like to protect their turf, but at the same time, it\u2019s just another business.\"\nVerge Video: Riding in the insane Tesla Model S\n","Title":"Tesla sales banned by West Virginia, whose Senate president is also an auto dealer | The Verge","Tags":["policy","business","us-world","transportation"]}
