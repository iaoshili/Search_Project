{"Main text":"Watch the Sagrada Familia's endless construction come to a close\nAntoni Gaudi's masterpiece to be completed in 2026, nearly 150 years after construction began\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMore than a century has passed since construction began on the Sagrada Familia, the ornate Barcelona church designed by famed architect Antoni Gaudi, and it will be another 13 years before it's finished. This week, the architects responsible for finishing the basilica  published a video animation of what the Sagrada Familia will look like in 2026, when construction is expected to be completed.\nThe video, embedded above, visualizes the various additions that will be made to the church in the coming years, as architect Jordi Faulí and his team continue their march skyward. It also puts the scale of the project in breathtaking perspective. The Sagrada Familia's central tower, when completed, will stand 566 feet above the ground, making it the tallest church in the world.\nAntoni Gaudi died in 1926 at the age of 73, when he was run over by a tram. Nine architects have overseen the Sagrada Familia's construction since then, each facing significant hurdles. Gaudi left behind detailed plans for the basilica at the time, but they were destroyed ten years after his death, when a group of anarchists stormed the building during the Spanish Civil War. Completing the Sagrada Familia has therefore  been difficult , but based on the video released this week, it's sure to be even more impressive in its final form.\n","Title":"Watch the Sagrada Familia's endless construction come to a close | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","design","architecture"]}
