{"Main text":"A video game about a cute pug that sniffs another cute pug's butt\nVideo games are fart\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor the past six years, my wife and I have restrained ourselves from adopting a dog. It hasn't been easy. For a dog lover, New York City's streets are a constant reminder that everyone else is receiving kisses from affectionate, warm, oh-so-cute-I-just-want-to-bite-their-little-noses-off dogs. When I pass a pup \u2014 any pup! \u2014 it takes everything in my being not to scoop that woofer into my pocket and run. So naturally I have fallen in love with Butt Sniffin' Pugs, one of many charming games at ALT.CTRL.GDC, a showcase at the Game Developers Conference that focuses on unusual control schemes.\nSpace Beagles ' Gabe Telepak explained the game's set-up on the show floor: each player controls their own pug with an oversized tennis ball that serves as a mouse. Two green buttons control two unique dog actions, like bark or bite. Additional actions, like poo and pee, can be switched-in by sniffing another dog's butt, itself triggered by bopping the rear end of a toy puppy.\nThe game doesn't feature levels or predetermined goals. Butt Sniffin' Pugs is just a chance to have some fun with cute pups. I wish I could bring it home for my wife.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
