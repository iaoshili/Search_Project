I don't think I've seen the first Avengers movie all the way through (I caught part of it one afternoon on HBO, just enough so I can say I've seen it in casual conversation and avoid 10 minutes of \"oh my god WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU!?\")\nBut I like to think of myself as a pretty skilled interpreter of visual media, and so when I started seeing this IMAX poster for Avengers: Age of Ultron floating around the internet, I had two thoughts: 1) That looks like a Transformers poster and an Expendables poster had a very noisy, gritty baby, and 2) What does that mean for Ultron? I immediately started perusing the debris-strewn graphic for clues and insight into the plot \u2014 and more importantly, the vibe \u2014 of the highly anticipated sequel.\nWant this poster at the UK & IRE @IMAX #AvengersAgeofUltron screenings?

Proceed with caution, especially if you don't want some of the most shocking moments from the summer's biggest movie spoiled for you.\n***Caution: major spoilers ahead!***\nWe open on the smoldering ruins of Tony Stark's house, which just got destroyed by a bunch of car parts being dropped on it. But who are those floating men fleeing the scene of the crime?\nNick Fury leans wistfully against a wall of car parts.\nNICK FURY: Damn, I'm gonna miss that place.\nTHOR: Did someone say my name?\nWild audience applause.\nTHOR: I will avenge* your house, Tony!\nIRON MAN: Hey everyone, take it down a notch, mkay? Let's try to figure out what kind of crazy enemy we're up against this time.\nSome debris crumbles in the breeze.\nIRON MAN: (murmuring distantly to himself) Yeah ... wires ... bolts ... that just may be the ticket!\nMeanwhile, Black Widow has found herself in quite the sexy predicament.\nBLACK WIDOW: You guys! I'm stuck in this triangle \u2014 I'm sure how much longer I can hold it back!\nHAWKEYE: I'll be right there, babe! Just as soon as I find these floating guys that messed up Tony's house...\nHULK: FOR FUCK'S SAKE, HAWKEYE, TURN THE FUCK AROUND, YOU USELESS WASTE OF SPACE\nHulk's body turns into cars.\nNICK FURY: Damn, I'm gonna miss that guy.\nA tube fills with some kind of energy.\nROLL CREDITS\nA villainous arrow is pointed at Captain America.\nCAPTAIN AMERICA: Uh, guys? Little help?\nCUT TO BLACK\n*wink!\nVox Video: Easter eggs from the Age of Ultron trailers\n","Title":"Everything we learned about Avengers: Age of Ultron from this atrocious IMAX poster | The Verge","Tags":["culture","tldr","entertainment","film"]}
