{"Main text":"The man who writes Spider-Man talks Marvel's Cinematic Universe\nA chat with comics writer Dan Slott about Spider-Man, Peter Parker, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSpider-Man\u2019s status quo at the movies is changing in a big way. As reported last week , Sony will share joint theatrical custody of Peter Parker with Marvel Studios, allowing the character to websling alongside his fellow Avengers Black Widow and Iron Man. For any Spider-Man fan \u2014 even halfway cynical ones like me \u2014 that\u2019s huge, but for current Spider-Man comics writer Dan Slott, it\u2019s exciting beyond all reason.\nSlott has spent the last 20 years writing comics. In that time he\u2019s written for Batman, The Avengers, Silver Surfer, and others, but he\u2019s currently Marvel\u2019s steward of Spider-Man lore, a mythology that\u2019s evolved over the last half century. Thousands of Spider-Man stories have been told by now \u2014 some intimate and others parallel universe-spanning, many classic and plenty that are best left forgotten \u2014 and Slott is well-regarded among fans for his ability to weave canon into new, often innovative stories.  Like giving all of New York City spider powers for one .  Or having Peter Parker found a startup for another . As a writer and the Spider Guy, he\u2019s in a singular position to feel ecstatic about the character\u2019s cinematic prospects. I took time to speak with him this week about the movies, telling Spider-Man stories, and what it means to be Peter Parker in a vast multiverse.\nWhat were your thoughts around Spider-Man finally coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe?\nI was completely side-swiped. I didn\u2019t see it coming at all. I had so long been told about the politics of it, and had been told by the powers that be that it was never, ever, ever going to happen. So, I was gobsmacked.\nYou write Spider-Man right now, but you\u2019ve also written The Avengers in comic form. Especially since there can\u2019t exactly be a clean slate for the character, what do you think this means for Spider-Man at the movies?\nThe thing that\u2019s exciting about it \u2014 and I don\u2019t want you to walk away going \"Oh! He hated every Spider-Man movie.\" \u2014 is that I love Spider-Man. I loved the first two Sam Raimi movies. And with the new Amazing Spider-Man movies, there are certain things about [them] that I love. I love the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, between Peter and Gwen. They\u2019re just adorable. You don\u2019t even need to swing around town or anything, you just put the two of them onscreen the whole time, and you can just watch that.\n\"It's the Golden Age of Heroes.\"\nThe great thing is, and there\u2019s no denying, the best superhero movies in the world are coming out from Marvel. Those are the movies that get everyone the most excited. Especially the Marvel Studios movies. A lot of people are trying to replicate what they did by having that combined universe, but what they did was astounding. They did these great single-unit movies first, so you really cared about Iron Man and Steve Rogers and the Hulk. You cared about Thor. And when you put them all together, it was like \"Oh my God!\" That\u2019s what\u2019s great about the comics. That it\u2019s this giant shared universe. It\u2019s this sandbox where all the comic books and all the characters and creators get to work in and weave this giant tapestry together. That hopefully everything that works makes all the other stuff that works even stronger. And the idea that you could bring Spider-Man into that world, that sandbox? It\u2019s the most exciting thing ever. As cool as it is to see Spider-Man onscreen, now I get to see Peter Parker and Tony Stark. I can\u2019t believe this day and age we live in. When I was growing, we had Christopher Reeve Superman, and that was it. You\u2019d better like it! [Now] it\u2019s the Golden Age for Heroes. I can\u2019t even imagine if I was a little kid, and if stuff like that came out when I was young. I would\u2019ve lost it.\nKids have no idea how lucky they are.\nThey are! And get off my yard!\nReboots means telling old stories in a new way. As far as writing Spider-Man is concerned, what\u2019s that process like? Taking an origin story, like what you did in last year\u2019s \"Learning to Crawl\" and finding new wrinkles.\n[In \" Learning to Crawl \"] we told a story that fit in the cracks of Spider-Man\u2019s first 60 days of being Spider-Man, which dealt with the first time he really had to fight a bad guy that was his own age, and also dealing with the fallout of everything that should be happening in his personal life. You know, his grades slipping, and Aunt May wondering what he\u2019s up to, and whether or not he should show off his powers at school. And it was fun to revisit that stuff.\nI don\u2019t think you should think of them as old characters. I think they\u2019re more like archetypes that have always been around. It\u2019s saying, \"How can you tell a new story with the nerdy guy? How can you tell a new story with the fool or the trickster?\" These characters have a resonance because they are eternal, and there\u2019s always something new to say. If not, we stop telling stories altogether. There\u2019s always some new thing happening in the world, so how would Spider-Man react to that. It\u2019s all very fun. Right now, in the comics, Spider-Man has his small startup company. That\u2019s a new thing for him! We\u2019ve never seen him try to do that. During the time I\u2019ve been working on the book \u2014 I\u2019m going into my eighth year writing Spider-Man \u2014 we passed the 50th anniversary. Spider-Man\u2019s been around for 50 years, and at some point if he\u2019s still taking pictures for the Daily Bugle, you go, \"Oh my God, what\u2019ve you done with your life Spider-Man?\" That\u2019s gonna look terrible at your high school reunion.\nYou just finished an event series, \"Spider-Verse,\" that featured dozens of Spider-People from the parallel dimensions in the Marvel universe. Still, you had Peter as the focus. Why is Peter Parker such an important character? Is Peter Parker the Spider-Man?\nWe just told this big story because, in over 50 years of Spider-Man, other cultures and other mediums\u2026 there are so many different kinds of Spider-Men. There\u2019s Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of India in another reality. There\u2019s the live-action Japanese Spider-Man who has a giant robot and a flying race car and a spaceship. There\u2019s a Spider-Man from a universe where he\u2019s a cartoon pig named Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham. There are so many different Spider-Men. And we just had a big, fun story where all you really need to know is that we took all those toys in the Spider-Man toy box, all these Spider-Men from over 50 years, and we threw all those toys up in the air and made a big fun adventure. And now that that adventure is over, it\u2019s not that Peter knows that he\u2019s the one true Spider-Man, because what you want to say is that all those Spider-Men are the true Spider-Man. Whichever Spider-Man you care about is the real Spider-Man.\n\"Whichever Spider-Man you care about is the real Spider-Man.\"\nWhat storyline would you most want to see on the big screen?\nAs a fan? If I had to discount anything that I\u2019ve written \u2014 me and my gigantic ego \u2014 I would say the J.M. DeMatteis story \" Kraven\u2019s Last Hunt .\" I would love for a screenwriter to mine that material.\nThis is something that comics fans get upset about when a movie is being made before they get a chance to see it. You have to change things for the movie. There are things that work in a comic, and then there are things that you can only do in a movie. But I think if someone, as a starting point, took \"Kraven\u2019s Last Hunt,\" which is one of the greatest Spider-Man stories ever told, I think you could have a phenomenal movie.\nAnd there are so many characters who haven\u2019t had their chance yet. I think  Mysterio would be one of the greatest movie villains. The guy\u2019s powers are special effects. That means you could do anything you\u2019ve ever seen in a movie in a Spider-Man. Anything. Blow up the White House. 10,000 aliens descending from space. Ghosts coming out of walls. Whatever you want! Matrix bullet time. I don\u2019t care. Eye-popping, blow-the-back-of-your-head-out special effects. It gives you free rein. There are just so many characters we haven\u2019t seen that are ripe to be the main character in a Spider-Man movie.\nPeter Parker does have the heritage of 50 years of adventures, as great as other characters in the costume are.\n\"The mask gives him the freedom to be anyone. The freedom to be someone just like you.\"\nThat said, one of the things I\u2019d be interested in seeing is, I hope they make the casting open for everyone. There\u2019s nothing inherently white about Peter Parker. Peter Parker is a nerdy outcast. Anybody, from any walk of life, can be a nerdy outcast. One of the reasons why Spider-Man speaks to everyone around the world is that mask. I\u2019ve met so many young Spider-Man fans over the years. People that grew up and are now old, but when they first met Spider-Man, they kind of didn\u2019t know who was under that mask. And that gives him the freedom to be anyone . That gives him the freedom to be someone just like you. It\u2019d be really nice to see that as a possibility. Even if they end up casting someone who, at the end of the day, looks just like Peter Parker. It would be nice if the door was open and they just [said] , \"Spider-Man can be anybody.\"\n","Title":"The man who writes Spider-Man talks Marvel's Cinematic Universe | The Verge","Tags":["culture","interview","entertainment"]}
