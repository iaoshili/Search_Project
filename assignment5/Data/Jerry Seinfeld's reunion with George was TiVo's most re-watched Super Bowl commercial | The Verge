{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNow that the Super Bowl XLVIII is in the books, it's time to crown the other victors from last night's competition \u2014 TiVo has just released a report that pulls together the most re-watched commercials from the night. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a clip of the Jerry Seinfeld \/ Jason Alexander episode of Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee web series , which aired during halftime, ranked number one. This was probably the most public stage in which Seinfeld, Alexander, and Wayne Knight as Newman reprised roles from the seminal sitcom \u2014 though a much more extensive meta-reunion took place during Curb Your Enthusiasm's seventh season, HBO's reach can't quite compete with the Super Bowl.\nOther top rewatched spots included Budweiser's heart-melter \"Puppy Love\" spot in second place, with GoDaddy's \"Bodybuilder,\" Doritos' \"Cowboy Kid,\" and Toyota's \"Terry Crews and The Muppets\" rounding out the top five. Despite the massive blowout in the game itself, it looks like viewers stayed tuned in for the commercials \u2014 three of the top five spots aired during the fourth quarter.\nThe new trend of advertisers and brands showing off their commercials ahead of the Super Bowl appears to only be driving buzz. For the second year in a row, nine of the top 10 most-rewatched commercials actually were released and promoted ahead of the big game. In a perhaps less-surprising trend, the halftime show was watched by more people than the game itself \u2014 the fourth year in a row that was the case. Of course, it's worth noting that this data comes specifically from TiVo households only \u2014 though the kind of DVR you're using probably doesn't have a huge influence on what commercials you want to watch.\n","Title":"Jerry Seinfeld's reunion with George was TiVo's most re-watched Super Bowl commercial | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5130223"]}
