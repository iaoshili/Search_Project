{"Main text":"Listen to the first 'Ninja Turtles' single from Juicy J, Wiz Khalifa, and Ty Dolla $ign\n\"You know I got your back just like a turtle shell.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs if the Michael Bay-produced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie  wasn't already going to be crazy enough , the film unveiled  the first single off of its soundtrack last night \u2014 and it easily brings this movie onto a completely new level of insane. Called \"Shell Shocked,\" the song is a thumping rap track featuring Wiz Khalifa, Juicy J, Ty Dolla $ign, laying down lyrics that casually relate to the movie like, \"All my brothers trying to get some cheddar \/ We all want to cut like Shredder.\" As you might imagine, this isn't a bastion of clever lyricism \u2014 \"You know I got your back just like a turtle shell\" \u2014 in fact, it even manages to get in some incredibly misogynistic language \u2014 \"Pass her off, I'm a real team player\" \u2014 in its short runtime. The movie will be released on August 8th.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
