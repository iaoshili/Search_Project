{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is continuing its push into the low-end smartphone market today with the launch of the Lumia 430. At just $70 before taxes, Microsoft labels it the \"most affordable Lumia to-date,\" and its basic specifications clearly help achieve that impressive price point. For the money you\u2019ll get a 4-inch WVGA display, 8GB of storage (with a microSD slot), and 1GB of RAM. This is all powered by a 1.2GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 200 processor, and a relatively small 1500 mAh battery. To put this all into perspective, you could buy nine of these Lumia 430 phones for the price of a single iPhone 6. You obviously won't get the same experience, but it shows just how cheap modern smartphones are getting.\nAvailable in April in limited regions\nThe Lumia 430 joins the  Lumia 435 and 532 handsets in Microsoft\u2019s lowest-priced Windows Phones, and its camera capabilities are very similar. There\u2019s only a 2-megapixel camera at the rear of the Lumia 430, with a VGA 0.3-megapixel camera at the front. That won\u2019t give you stunning smartphone photography, but for the price it\u2019s understandable. Microsoft says it\u2019s planning to make the Lumia 430 available in April in APAC, IMEA, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus.\nIf you\u2019re still waiting on the company to release a high-end flagship Windows phone then that wait will continue until the summer at the earliest. Microsoft previously revealed that it won\u2019t be launching a new flagship handset until Windows 10 is available. The software maker promised to  launch Windows 10 in the summer earlier this week, but with the Windows 10 for phones preview lagging behind its desktop counterpart it\u2019s not clear whether phones will actually launch with the software in the summer period. Either way, no successor to the Lumia 930 or Lumia 1020 will arrive until later this year.\nVerge Video: Windows 10 on a phone and tablet\n","Title":"Microsoft's new Lumia 430 is its cheapest Windows phone yet at just $70 | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","mobile","tech"]}
