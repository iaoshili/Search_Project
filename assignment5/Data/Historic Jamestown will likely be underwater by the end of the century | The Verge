{"Main text":"Historic Jamestown will likely be underwater by the end of the century\nInterior Secretary says, \"What's at risk is the history of our country.\"\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmerica's oldest known permanent European settlement might one day be drowned by the rising seas, leaving it standing only in history books.  The Associated Press reports that US Interior Secretary Sally Jewell recently visited Jamestown Island, Virginia as part of the Obama administration's push to address climate changes. \"It's very clear we have global warming and sea level rise and this is a hot spot for it,\" said Jewell, who described the historic location as \"highly vulnerable.\"\nPark Service natural resource specialist Dorothy Geyer told The Associated Press that a one-and-a-half-foot rise in sea levels could put 60 percent of the island under water, while a 4-foot-plus increase would submerge 80 percent of the landmass. Earlier in May, the Union of Concerned Scientists listed Jamestown Island in  their report detailing 30 historical landmarks that were under threat from climate changes. It states that the waters around Jamestown have been increasing at a rate of more than twice that of the global average, with Virginia's sea levels predicted to rise \"as much as 2 feet by 2050 and up to 6 feet by the turn of the century.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
