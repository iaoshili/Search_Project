This picture is full of amazing science. It's a weasel riding a flying woodpecker, and it's making you feel some #feels. Fortunately, weasel-woodpecker acceptance is within reach, and these steps will get you there.\n1) Denial: is this shit real?\nThe weasel riding the woodpecker is the cutest thing right now, but I need to know if it's real or not. http:\/\/t.co\/2QHu3fSJob\n\u2014 Angela Anderson (@angeandersonyyc) March 3, 2015\nOkay tell me the weasel riding the woodpecker pic isn't real?!\n\u2014 Emma Lush Jane (@Emmzza) March 3, 2015\nI'm calling it right now. The photo of the weasel riding a woodpecker is not real.\n\u2014 Dan Riskin (@riskindan) March 2, 2015\nIt's hard not to question the veracity of this image. You mumble \"photoshop\" as you look at it. Fortunately, the internet has answers: this is the real deal. A man by the name of Martin Le-May took a series of pictures of the pair when he heard distress calls from the bird \u2014 a European green woodpecker \u2014 in Hornchurch Country Park in East London,  according to NBC .\nCredit: Martin Le-May\nYou finally accept that it's real. After all, this has happened before.\n2) Searching for truth (or why is this happening?! OMG.)\nThe Rescuers were on a mission, so what's up with this weasel? You do some Googling and find out that real life isn't nearly as rosy: this is a sneak attack gone wrong.\nThis species of woodpeckers feeds on the ground. The weasel likely tried to pounce on the bird while it was looking for insects to eat. When the woodpecker realized what was going on, it took off. All the weasel could do at that point was hold on for dear life. \"This was a struggle for life,\" Le-May told  ITV News . The pair got about 10 feet off the ground before landing again. Back on the soil, the woodpecker was able to break free from the weasel. Both animals appeared unharmed,  Le-May told Slate .\n3) Embracing the magic\nI can't take you there. You have to get there on your own \u2014 or you can ask a bare-chested Putin for help.\nThe #PeckerWeasel legacy continues. Episode V: The Weasel Strikes Back. Ft.
