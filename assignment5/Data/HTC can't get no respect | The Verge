{"Main text":"HTC can't get no respect\nMeet the Rodney Dangerfield of the mobile industry\n\"Oh, when I was a kid, I got no respect.\nI played hide and seek.\nThey wouldn\u2019t even look for me.\"\nLike the late American comedian Rodney Dangerfield, HTC is a company suffering from a chronic lack of respect. The Taiwanese phone maker has a pedigree of mobile innovation rivaling that of Nokia and Apple, but last week it had to change its CEO amid ambivalent feedback to its latest smartphone and a struggle to generate consistent profits. There are many challenges for new CEO Cher Wang to overcome in the months ahead, but beside the technical issue of just building better cameras , probably the most critical among them will be to reestablish the company\u2019s respectability.\nThe invisible missing ingredient for HTC in the past few years has been the respect and cooperation of mobile carriers. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the biggest successes of the smartphone era, Apple\u2019s iPhone and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy series, are available on every carrier in almost every country in the world. Those devices are prominently promoted and sold in their native state, exactly as their maker intended. There will never be an iDroid on Verizon, and Samsung\u2019s vast scale has recently helped it escape the silly rebranding and redesign exercises enforced by the brain trusts at AT&T and Big Red. HTC is in precisely the opposite position. It needs carriers, carriers don\u2019t feel like they need it.\nThe bloatware apps you can\u2019t uninstall on your HTC One? Blame carrier deals. Delays in updating to the latest Android version? Carrier certification is usually what takes the longest (though Google isn\u2019t helping matters, either, with HTC typically getting the latest Android code at roughly the same time as Google announces it). HTC is deeply aware of the things it needs to deliver to make its phones compelling, but it\u2019s habitually tripped up by the partners who are supposed to aid it in that quest.\nSome of HTC's wounds have been self-inflicted\nThe asymmetric relationship with carriers might be a vestige of HTC\u2019s history as a white-label manufacturer whose devices once bore better-known brands. A more likely culprit, though, is the simple fact that the small and mighty HTC is now defined more by its smallness than its mightiness. It\u2019s been a long time since HTC\u2019s 2011 apogee of being the leading smartphone manufacturer in the US , and some of its wounds have been self-inflicted.\nTwo years ago, the flagship One M7 smartphone was leaked by none other than HTC\u2019s then-CEO, Peter Chou , who waved it excitedly on a stage in front of hundreds. A year later, a teenager on YouTube preempted the One M8 announcement with a 12-minute hands-on overview , and this year\u2019s M9 has been the most comprehensive leak of them all. Pictures, promo videos, and even in-depth impressions of the new phone emerged in the days ahead of its big launch.\nHTC\u2019s pursuit of the widest possible coverage \u2014 both in terms of press attention and store distribution \u2014 is costing it the quality and secrecy of its products. It\u2019s noteworthy that the Vive virtual reality headset , which HTC didn\u2019t have to distribute to carrier and retailer partners ahead of time, managed to remain completely secret until the moment of its announcement. It\u2019s an odd situation, because the factors tripping up HTC tend to reside outside of its control, but it\u2019s the company\u2019s own decisions that have led to its present state of dependency.\nThe Vive VR headset shows that HTC can still innovate in secret \u2014 so long as there are no mobile carriers involved\nHTC\u2019s legacy of great design and bold risk taking feels like it\u2019s worth more respect than the company is currently getting. Long before Apple could build an all-metal iPhone, HTC dared to encase an entire phone in aluminum with its 2010 Legend. Before Samsung made the large-screen smartphone category its own, it was the seminal HTC HD2 that had the first 4.3-inch touchscreen. HTC also built the first ever Android phone, the T-Mobile G1, and the first 4G smartphone in the USA, the EVO 4G. But not every risk taken by HTC has been a good one, with its investments in 3D imaging (a gimmick), UltraPixel and DuoCam camera technology (dual gimmicks), and Beats Audio (a branding gimmick) all undermining its status as a reliable technology leader.\nRespect is something to be earned rather than demanded. HTC's hardware design team has earned it. Now the rest of the company needs to step up to the same standard.\nVerge Video: Reviewing the HTC One M9\n","Title":"HTC can't get no respect | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","business","tech","essay\",\"Story Streams\"","\"4625281"]}
