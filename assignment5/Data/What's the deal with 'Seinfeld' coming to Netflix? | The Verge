Speaking in an  AMA question and answer session on Reddit, the comedian replied  \"conversations are presently taking place\" when asked if the hit show, created by Seinfeld himself and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David, would be brought to the streaming service. The show originally aired between 1989 and 1998, but  maintains its grasp on pop culture : one man recently developed  a virtual version of Jerry's on-screen apartment that fans could navigate using the Oculus Rift headset.\nIn addition to confirming that his show could soon be on its way to Netflix, Seinfeld used the Reddit AMA to reminisce on his comedy career, describing the making of the now-classic comedy series that bears his name. The comedian said one of his most memorable Seinfeld scenes came when Jerry Stiller as George Costanza's father  challenged Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Elaine to a fight , denied a rumor that every episode of the show featured a Superman reference, and dropped the bombshell that he never really drank coffee in the 1990s. He also dished out advice for clothes shopping \u2014 when asked where the second button on a shirt should sit, Seinfeld said \"it shouldn't pull the fabric, and it shouldn't show, you know, more than a certain amount of breastbone.\" It is, he said, \"a tricky button.\"\n","Title":"What's the deal with 'Seinfeld' coming to Netflix? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
