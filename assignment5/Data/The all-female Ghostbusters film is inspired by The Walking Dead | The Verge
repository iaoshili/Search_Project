{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPaul Feig's upcoming Ghostbusters reboot is definitely going to be scarier than the originals. During an interview on AMC's Talking Dead on Sunday, the Bridesmaids director admitted that he felt \"very inspired\" by The Walking Dead, and is looking to bring a similar sense of constant dread to the comedy.\n\"What I love is how they play with the danger,\" he said, \"they play with the scariness, but also the idea that it\u2019s always about running the gauntlet. And that\u2019s something, an element I want to bring to this Ghostbusters reboot is having to get through these various obstacles that are supernatural and all that. I really feed off of The Walking Dead.\"\n\"I really feed off 'The Walking Dead.'\"\nWe already know that Feig and writer Katie Dippold intend on blending actual horror with comedy for the reboot.  Late last year , the director told Empire Magazine that, though the scary bits wouldn't override the comedic performances,  \"Katie and I are so focused on wanting to do scary comedy. We don\u2019t want to hold back.\" That means fans can likely expect  the four leads \u2014  Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones \u2014 to face the kind of creeping terror and races for survival audiences already see on AMC's horror drama. The new Ghostbusters is expected to start shooting this year.\n","Title":"The all-female Ghostbusters film is inspired by The Walking Dead | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
