But what if they mellowed out a bit, say with some jazz? That's the idea Brazilian designer Rafael Melandi had when he decided to reimagine his favorite 1980s metal album covers with the style of 1950s jazz classics. \"The result is that the minimalism and skillfulness of the art of the jazz period works perfectly with the strength of metal,\" he tells The Verge.\nHis design series, called \"Metazz,\" features everything from a bright, orange, sunny take on Sepultura's \"Arise\" to a Megadeth album that looks like a wonderful, lost sci-fi B-movie. On his Behance page , Melandi has included a side-by-side comparison that shows how his new interpretations compare to the original covers. And while they all look very different, they all still manage to evoke many of the same feelings.\n\"The design experiment was meant to be like a time machine,\" he says, \"respecting the original art covers' messages and objective.\"\nYou can find more of his work here .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
