Alexander Skarsgård, best known to audiences as the vampire Eric Northman in HBO's True Blood, is slated to play the title role, with The Wolf of Wall Street's Margot Robbie cast as his love interest. Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained) and Samuel L. Jackson round out the cast.\nDavid Yates, who directed a number of the Harry Potter films as well as the miniseries State of Play, will be behind the camera. Created by author Edgar Rice Burroughs, the character of Tarzan has received the live-action movie treatment before, most notably in 1984's Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. This new project seems positioned as much more of a big summer blockbuster than that film was, with producer Jerry Weintraub saying in a statement that \"David Yates and I are going to be using the best of today's technology in creating this new adventure.\" However, given last year's domestic box-office disappointment The Lone Ranger, it's not a given that older, classic characters are enough to lure modern audiences into the theater.\n","Title":"A live-action 3D 'Tarzan' movie is coming in 2016 | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
