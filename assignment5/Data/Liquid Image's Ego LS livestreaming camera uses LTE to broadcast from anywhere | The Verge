{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nEvery year at CES, a whole host of products are introduced \u2014 and never launched. The Liquid Image Ego LS 800 is one of those unfortunate products, but this year the company is back and says it has improved its offering and will be ready to ship it this spring. The updated Ego LS 800 retains its key features, most significantly the ability to record up to 1080p video at 30 FPS (or 720p video at 60 FPS) from a small, wearable camera \u2014 and as the company said last year, it'll be able to simultaneously broadcast that video over LTE. However, this year the company has improved the LTE chipset that's onboard so it can run on Verizon's LTE network.\nLifestreamers, take notice\nHaving the biggest carrier in the US on its side should certainly help fulfill the promise of the Ego LS 800, but the company has also added metadata support \u2014 a variety of Bluetooth-enabled, third-party peripherals will be able to connect to the camera and transmit information that'll be viewable along side your videos. A few examples given were biometric sensor data as well as GPS location data, things that could be useful to the camera's target market. However, they weren't ready to talk specifics about exactly what devices will work with the Ego, but Liquid Image did say it would have partnerships and a list of specific supported devices that'll be available when the camera launches.\nPricing remains unchanged from last year: $399.99 will get you the camera as well as the LTE \"sled\" that it docks into to allow it to transmit. It's not a cheap device, and clearly intended for a very specific audience, but support and certification from Verizon means it will probably be a fairly well-supported option. Just make sure you have a data plan that can support your ambitions \u2014 Liquid Image says that 1 GB of data should be good for about four hours of recording time, but only on the medium quality setting. Sending full 1080p video over Verizon's network could add up fast.\n","Title":"Liquid Image's Ego LS livestreaming camera uses LTE to broadcast from anywhere | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
