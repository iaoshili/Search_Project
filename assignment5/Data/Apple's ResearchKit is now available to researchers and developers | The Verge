ResearchKit is designed to help doctors, researchers, and scientists develop apps that can gather more data for clinical studies, without patients ever having to physically enter a lab. In a statement, Apple said over 60,000 users have been enrolled in research apps used to study diseases including asthma, breast cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson\u2019s disease in the few weeks ResearchKit apps have been available in the App Store.\nResearchKit has been hailed as a game changer by some in the medical and scientific fields, but there are some  ethical concerns and privacy issues that may persist for some time . For instance, minors aren't supposed to take part in clinical studies without parental consent, but they can easily lie about their age on an iPhone. While ResearchKit can be a truly powerful tool for doctors and researchers around the world, there are some areas where Apple could improve the platform to ensure it protects and benefits everyone.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
