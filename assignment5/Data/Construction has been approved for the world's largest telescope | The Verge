Calcada\nThe telescope will be built in Chile, on top of a mountain called Cerro Armazones, in the country's Atacama Desert. The project was originally approved in June of 2012, but construction could only begin once 90 percent of the total funding had been secured. The project's current approval is only related to the first phase of construction, reports Space ; the Council will approve the second phase after the funds are acquired.\nThis is \"the most powerful of all the extremely large telescope projects currently planned,\" de Zeeuw said. Once built, the Cerro Armazones mountain will sport a 39-meter aperture optical and infrared telescope, which means that scientists will be able to characterize Earth-sized exoplanets and study star populations in nearby galaxies. \"The next few years,\" de Zeeuw said, \"will be very exciting.\"\n","Title":"Construction has been approved for the world's largest telescope | The Verge","Tags":["science","us-world","tech"]}
