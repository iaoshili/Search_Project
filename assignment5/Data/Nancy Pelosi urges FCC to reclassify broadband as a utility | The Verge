{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA good number of politicians have recently made statements in favor of net neutrality, but House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is going further than most of them today andÂ  asking that the Federal Communications Commission reclassify broadband as a utility using Title II of the Communications Act \u2014 exactly what net neutrality advocates have been pushing for. In a letter to FCC chair Tom Wheeler, Pelosi writes that Title II is \"an appropriate tool to refine modern rules,\" and that it can do so without the FCC overburdening broadband providers.\nThe reason that the FCC is currently amid this whole internet \"fast lane\" debacle is that it's chosen to regulate internet providers using a less stringent allowance in the Communications Act. Though the commission could go ahead and use Title II \u2014 allowing it to impose more significant regulations and avoid fast lanes \u2014 it would be a politically tricky move that would upset internet giants who have a large lobbying force in Washington. The FCC is currently accepting public comments on its proposal to use the method that would allow for fast lanes, and advocates are looking for it to change course.\n\"An appropriate tool to refine modern rules\"\n\"I remain concerned ... that the Federal Communications Commission may act in a way that would permit broadband providers to discriminate against the content consumers and innovators create and enjoy,\" Pelosi writes. \"Innovators prefer bright-line rules and worry the proposed rules would force them into commercial arrangements that require payment of tolls in cash or equity to get their ideas on the internet.\"\nThough Pelosi can't directly alter the FCC's decision, her position as minority leader of the House gives her opinion significant sway and should set an example for other Democrats. Her language already echoes exactly what we've seen from other net neutrality advocates \u2014 the only difference is that most haven't gone so far as to explicitly endorse the controversial Title II classification. Pelosi also notes that Title II will allow the commission to protect consumers against fraudulent billing and privacy infringements.\nThe FCC's period for reply comments on its net neutrality proposal closes next Monday. Its initial commenting period received 1.1 million replies from the public.\nInnovators & consumers deserve robust net neutrality protection & an open Internet.
