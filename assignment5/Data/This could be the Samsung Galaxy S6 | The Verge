{"Main text":"This could be the Samsung Galaxy S6\nWill we see two phones from Samsung at Mobile World Congress?\nUpdate: Read the  Galaxy S6 review .\nWith a  March 1st announcement just a few days away, it looks like Samsung may have sprung a leak. Photos  posted on xda-developers forum and  unearthed by Mobile Bulgaria show a test device that could easily be the first glimpse of the Galaxy S6. The phone doesn't have a display that bleeds over the edge as  Samsung teased in its ads , which could signify that this is an early prototype, or that Samsung is going to release two different variations of its flagship device. All will be unveiled on March 1st during Samsung's event at Mobile World Congress.  Stay tuned for our coverage from the show floor .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
