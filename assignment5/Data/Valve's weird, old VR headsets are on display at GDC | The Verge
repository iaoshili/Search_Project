{"Main text":"Valve's weird, old VR headsets are on display at GDC\nA rare peek into a legendary program\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis week, Valve announced that it was partnering with HTC for the Vive headset, a virtual reality display that Valve co-founder Gabe Newell promised made \"zero percent of people\" motion sick. Very little was known about the Vive before release, but Valve's virtual reality prototypes have been something of a legend in the VR community \u2014 especially the \"VR room,\" a room covered in barcodes that created a precise location-tracking system.\nWhile it wasn't as exciting as the actual Vive , Valve had a few pieces of its history on display at the 2015 Game Developers Conference. Turns out it took a lot of experimentation to get from barcodes to lasers.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nValve's first efforts at motion tracking involved putting QR code-like tags all over a room's walls; a camera on the headset read the codes, got a precise location, and moved the wearer accordingly.\nValve's early headsets were noted for having very low latency, compared to the relatively blurry Oculus Rift. This is a small, one-eye prototype.\nThis was Valve's \"first glimpse of presence,\" and it's the headset that got a lot of people talking about VR when Valve showed it off at Steam Dev Days in 2014.\nThis version of Valve's headset appeared in public a few months later, in mid-2014. Instead of having a head-mounted camera track barcodes, an external camera tracked dots on the headset, more like the Oculus Rift.\nLike the Vive, the dot-tracked headset came with a controller that was also covered in motion-tracking dots.\nAfter the dots, Valve moved to its current laser-tracked system. \"Our first approach to this was to just hot-glue the sensors to one of our dot-tracked headsets,\" reads the placard.\nAnother step towards the Vive, this one with integrated sensors.\nAnd now we're almost up to the present, with the prototype controllers that accompany Valve's Vive demo.\n","Title":"Valve's weird, old VR headsets are on display at GDC | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","photo-essay","entertainment","gdc-2015"]}
