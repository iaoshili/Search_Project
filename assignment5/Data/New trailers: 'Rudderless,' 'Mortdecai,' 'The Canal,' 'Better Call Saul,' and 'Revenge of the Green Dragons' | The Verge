{"Main text":"12 Comments\nThe summer movie season may be winding down, but there are still some huge new titles in theaters this weekend, including The Giver and The Expendables 3. As usual, what's coming to theaters in the next few months looks quite a bit different, from more emotional stories to far spookier ones for this October. We've rounded up five of this week's best new trailers below so that you can take a look at what's coming up in the not-too-distant future.\nRudderless\nWilliam H. Macy is making his directorial debut this year with Rudderless, a film about a man\u2019s troubled life after the death of his son. Music plays a big role in the film, so hopefully you're into kind-of acousticy family rock, or else this trailer may not play as well for you. It\u2019ll be in theaters and available on-demand October 17th.\nMortdecai\nJohnny Depp is doing his thing again in Mortdecai, a comedy that finds the star playing an outrageous, Inspector Clouseau-esque spy, of sorts, crossing the globe in order to track down a stolen painting. It\u2019ll be in theaters February 6th.\nThe Canal\nHere\u2019s the trailer for the latest seriously creepy movie coming this October. The Canal finds a man struggling to tell the difference between dark spirits and what may be his own descent into insanity as police begin to investigate him for the disappearance of his wife.\nBetter Call Saul\nOkay, this teaser is only 10 seconds long \u2014 not even that if you don\u2019t count the title card. But still, it\u2019s hard not to be excited by our first glimpse at Breaking Bad spinoff Better Call Saul, which has Bob Odenkirk reprising his role as the lovely sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman. Look for it this February.\nRevenge of the Green Dragons\nMartin Scorsese executive producers this crime drama about Asian-American gangs in New York during the \u201880s and \u201890s. Revenge of the Green Dragons is also co-directed by the director behind the Infernal Affairs series \u2014 which Scorsese adapted into The Departed \u2014 so this film is bringing together a powerhouse of gangster-movie filmmakers. There's no doubt that'll pique the interest of many fans. You'll be able to see it in theaters this October.\n","Title":"New trailers: 'Rudderless,' 'Mortdecai,' 'The Canal,' 'Better Call Saul,' and 'Revenge of the Green Dragons' | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
