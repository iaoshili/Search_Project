{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDC's plan to  jumpstart an expanded superhero movie universe with Warner Bros. has seemed shaky on many fronts, but one of the undisputed highlights has been that Emmy-winning director Michelle MacLaren would be making her feature debut with Wonder Woman. As it turns out, that won't be happening after all. According to a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter , MacLaren has left the project due to \"creative differences\" with Warner Bros.\nSigning MacLaren had been a coup for Warner Bros.\nIt's not clear what the exact issues were, but getting MacLaren to direct Wonder Woman had been something of a coup for the studio. The director-producer has been part of some of the very best television made in recent years, directing episodes of Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and Better Call Saul. Gal Gadot is still attached to star in Wonder Woman, which is slated for release in 2017. Gadot will be making her first appearance as the character next year in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\nIf MacLaren is interested in pursuing another superhero franchise, she'll certainly have options.  According to The Wrap she's already rumored for Captain Marvel, the 2018 film that will be the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to focus on a female superhero as the lead character. The studio is said to be specifically looking for a female director to tackle the project, and has recently signed writers Meg LeFauve (Inside Out) and Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy) to write the film.\n","Title":"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren leaves the Wonder Woman movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","film"]}
