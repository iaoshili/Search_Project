{"Main text":"The designers behind the Nike FuelBand are working on old-school watches\nSan Francisco's Astro Studios looks back to see the future\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIf you were to place a bet on the future of wearables, odds are good that your cash would not go toward a line of ordinary wristwatches. Yes, wristwatches: the things that tell the time and little else, often operating on centuries-old technology. The very objects that were disrupted by cellphones over the last decade. Dinosaurs.\nDon\u2019t tell that to Astro Studios, though. The prolific San Francisco-based branding and design firm has helped meld a variety of high-tech products ranging from Sol Republic headphones and the Xbox 360 to the awesome-looking (but ultimately unsuccessful) Boxee Box. Now, it\u2019s turning its attention to a line of watches \u2014 just regular, plain-old watches \u2014 that it sells under the Minus-8 brand. (The name is a subtle reference to San Francisco\u2019s time zone, Greenwich Mean Time minus eight hours.)\nMinus-8\u2019s line currently consists of four models, ranging in price from $198 for the simple Zone to $598 for the Layer 24, a full four-dial chronograph. They\u2019re big, heavy, wholly unapologetic timepieces. It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re sending a middle finger in the direction of the wearables industry that\u2019s trying to kill them.\nSo why do they exist? Why now, in the shadow of Android Wear , the Apple Watch , and countless fitness bands? Part of it is old-fashioned indulgence on the part of Astro. \"From a pure design standpoint, it\u2019s sort of like doing that classic chair, that piece of furniture, that eyewear, the bag, the shoes. I mean, there\u2019s sort of a designer hit list that you kind of want to go through over the years. So watches sort of fell into that,\" says Brett Lovelady, Astro\u2019s founder and CEO. \"We shared [Minus-8] with the design community and got a lot of traction and ended up in a bunch of publications and things, so we basically decided to manufacture a certain number of the products.\"\nIt turns out that a dumbwatch can still attract some attention\nStill, it\u2019s surprising. It\u2019s not that Astro doesn\u2019t have experience with wearables or smartwatches; the firm was behind the design of the Nike FuelBand, one of the first widely popular connected wearables. It just turns out that a dumbwatch (if you will) can still attract some attention, as long as it\u2019s done correctly.\nWhile the concept started in an Astro conference room, Minus-8 is owned by PCH International, a company that handles the ins and outs of turning ideas into actual products. PCH\u2019s bread and butter lies in Asian-manufactured electronics. These watches are decidedly not electronics, but the DNA comes through: they employ a \"layered\" manufacturing technique, for instance, which Lovelady tells me was inspired by the layer-by-layer construction in the electronics industry. For Minus-8, this means a stack of stainless steel slices on the cases of the Layer and Layer 24 models that are bound together; by changing the colors of individual slices, Astro has a lot of flexibility in tweaking the design.\nAnd like many modern gadgets, the Minus-8 watches are assembled in China. The cheaper models use Quartz movements; the larger, heavier, more expensive ones use self-winding mechanical ones, but they\u2019re all Japanese \u2014 not Swiss, like you find in most higher-end timepieces. \"We felt like our customers would appreciate Japanese movements as well as, you know, Swiss or other movements. Especially at the price points that we\u2019re talking about,\" Lovelady says.\nIt\u2019s an interesting line that Astro is walking, pairing the design sensibility of a nice watch with the manufacturing sensibility (and the price) of a typical gadget. While handcrafted ultra-luxury watches get away with charging tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 unaffected by the sea changes in technology that are happening all around them \u2014 Minus-8 is made and priced no differently than the wearables it goes head-to-head against.\n\"I don\u2019t know how much of a watch junkie you might be, but a lot of people have multiples.\"\nLovelady is still bullish about his prospects, because watches fill a role in the wardrobe that smartwatches and other wearables simply haven\u2019t been able to. \"I think the reason you\u2019ll still see traditional watches do really well is because they\u2019re also still involved in traditional relationships of apparel and fashion and expression and all those things,\" he says. \"I don\u2019t know how much of a watch junkie you might be, but a lot of people have multiples, just like they have different kinds of shoes and they want to wear that watch on that day.\" He says that the Apple Watch, with its high level of customization and personalization, is taking some strides in that direction \u2014 but for now, the theory goes that the watch still has its place.\nThat\u2019s not to say the studio is spurning smartwatches altogether; Lovelady acknowledges that Minus-8 could eventually move in that direction. In fact, some of its current models have an NFC chip molded into the band that can trigger a programmed action on an Android phone (launching the camera app, for example). \"It\u2019s more of an easter egg,\" Lovelady says. \"It\u2019s a nod toward technology.\" Otherwise, though, these are just good-looking timepieces that don\u2019t cost a ton of money, trends be damned.\n\"We\u2019re not worried about following anybody else.\"\n","Title":"The designers behind the Nike FuelBand are working on old-school watches | The Verge","Tags":["report","design"]}
