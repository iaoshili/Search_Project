{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNewsweek's Twitter account was briefly overtaken this morning by a pro-Islamic State group identifying itself with the hashtag CyberCaliphate. The account sent out messages threatening the Obama family. \"Bloody Valentine's Day #MichelleObama! We're watching you, you girls and your husband!\" was tweeted several times by the compromised Newsweek account, with supposed leaks of sensitive documents interspersed between the threatening language. All of the rogue tweets have since been deleted.\nThe Newsweek hack follows an embarrassing temporaryÂ  seizure of the US Central Command Twitter account that occurred last month. Both were carried out by the same perpetrators if the accompanying message is anything to go by. \"While the US and its satellites kill our brothers in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan we broke into your networks and personal devices and know everything about you,\" said a message posted to Newsweek's account. It's yet another reminder of the security challenges faced by high-profile Twitter accounts as ISIS sympathizers look to voice their support to wide audiences through social media. Newsweek has 2.5 million followers. It never takes long for these things to veer into humor, though, which probably isn't the tone ISIS was hoping for.\nWe really need to have a discussion about @Newsweek 's new social media intern. pic.twitter.com\/7D6e41jHxi\n\u2014 Brooklyn Middleton (@BklynMiddleton) February 10, 2015\nI just don't think @newsweek 's latest attempt at reinvention is going to work, either pic.twitter.com\/mVDvLowiYR\n","Title":"Newsweek's Twitter account briefly hacked, threatens Obama family | The Verge","Tags":["apps","us-world","tech"]}
