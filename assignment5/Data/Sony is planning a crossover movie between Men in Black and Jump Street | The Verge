{"Main text":"Sony is planning a crossover movie between Men in Black and Jump Street\nWait, what?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA lot of very strange news has already come out of the Sony Pictures hack , but this might be the strangest. According to The Wall Street Journal, emails have been found in the leaked cache of documents that reveal the movie studio is planning to make a crossover movie involving the Men in Black and Jump Street franchises for a 2016 or 2017 release.\nWhile the movie won't feature Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, Jump Street actors Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are expected to star. One of the emails uncovered comes from Hill himself, who expresses his excitement to Sony's studio head Amy Pascal by saying \"jump street merging with mib i think that\u2019s clean and rad and powerful.\"\n\"jump street merging with mib i think that\u2019s clean and rad and powerful.\"\nEven though there is little in place right now, the movie will supposedly be one of the studio's tentpole films. According to another email from Hannah Minghella, the president of production for Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures label, that's not a problem. \"We don\u2019t have a script yet so we\u2019ll be greenlighting the movie off the concept and the talent involved,\" she wrote.\nThe saving graces for this crazy idea might be Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are apparently producing and writing the film. The duo have not only helmed the Jump Street movies, but also directed and wrote Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, The Lego Movie, and the short-lived cult hit MTV animated series Clone High.\n","Title":"Sony is planning a crossover movie between Men in Black and Jump Street | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7116622"]}
