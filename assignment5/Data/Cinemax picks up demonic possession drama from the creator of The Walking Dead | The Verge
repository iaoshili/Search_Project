{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRobert Kirkman, the creator of The Walking Dead, hasn't been standing still in the wake of that show's tremendous success, and now he's got his next show lined up at Cinemax. The network has placed a 10-episode order for Outcast, an adaptation of this exorcism comic of the same name, with Patrick Fugit (Gone Girl, Almost Famous) starring as a man who has been surrounded by demonic possession his entire life. The series has  been in development at Cinemax since 2013, with horror favorite Adam Wingard (The Guest, V\/H\/S) having directed the pilot.\nOutcast could become one of three different series that Kirkman might soon have on the air. In addition to Dead and Outcast, he's also been developing a prequel series for The Walking Dead at AMC. That as-of-yet untitled show will take place in Los Angeles in the  time period before Rick Grimes wakes up in the original show, meaning that it will likely document civilization falling apart while the zombie apocalypse begins to take its toll. The Walking Dead prequel hasn't been ordered to series just yet, but given the continued popularity of the original we'd be shocked if it didn't make it to air. And given AMC's  incredible prequel success thus far with Better Call Saul , the only real question is if the network will feel the need to jump back in time for a Mad Men prequel in order to fill its programming slots.\nWe're joking on that last point. Mostly.\n","Title":"Cinemax picks up demonic possession drama from the creator of The Walking Dead | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","tv"]}
