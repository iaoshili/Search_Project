He'll be available in a pack of four characters \u2014 the others haven't been announced yet, but will include two classic Mortal Kombat fighters and one \"special guest character\" \u2014 that comes with the collector's editions of the game. If you want to buy them separately, it will cost a whopping $29.99 for the set (it will also include a handful of new character skins). Whether his machete-based fatalities will be worth the price of admission remains to be seen.\nMortal Kombat X will be launching on April 14th for a number of platforms, including PC, PS4, and Xbox One.\nVerge Video archives: Gameplay footage of Mortal Kombat X (2014)\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
