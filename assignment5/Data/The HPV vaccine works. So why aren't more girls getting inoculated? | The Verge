In fact, far more parents are neglecting to immunize their children with Gardasil, a cancer vaccine.\nGardasil provides immunity against several strains of HPV, a virus known to be responsible for numerous forms of cancer \u2014 most notably cervical and anal \u2014 and genital warts. The vaccine is incredibly effective: in its original form, it protects against the four strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancer cases and 90 percent of genital warts; an updated version approved this past December protects against five additional strains, potentially eliminating 90 percent of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. When given before first sexual contact, Gardasil can offer near full protection against the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), as well as the life-threatening cancers that sometimes result from it.\nonly 38 percent of adolescent girls had received all three doses of the vaccine\nBut nearly a decade after its introduction to market, rates of Gardasil inoculation are still low. As recently as 2013, only 38 percent of adolescent girls ages 13\u201317 (the primary target group for inoculation) had received all three doses of the vaccine in the US \u2014 about half the rate seen in other developed countries, like Australia. There are several reasons for this lag in vaccination rates. As with any vaccine, there\u2019s a small number of people who refuse Gardasil out of a general stance against vaccination. But that\u2019s not why most people avoid Gardasil. These people are both parents who fear that inoculating children against an STI will encourage reckless and promiscuous behavior and, more surprisingly, are educated parents who consider themselves pro-sex and pro-vaccine, but simply aren\u2019t convinced that Gardasil itself is safe, especially for children.\n( Eugene Peretz )\nThough much has been made of Gardasil\u2019s status as sex-related vaccine, a study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates that fears of Gardasil-induced promiscuity are likely misguided. An investigation of insurance claims from over 200,000 teenage girls (about 10 percent of whom had received Gardasil) showed no indication that vaccination made girls more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior.\nthere's no indication that a simple vaccine acts as a catalyst for sexual behavior\nThe idea that a vaccine like Gardasil might promote unsafe behavior isn\u2019t entirely baseless. One study found a correlation between STI-related treatments (in this case, HIV therapies) and an increase in risky sexual behaviors, says Anupam Jena, an author of the more recent study on Gardasil. But, Jena points out, there\u2019s a vast difference between HIV-infected adults (many of whom have a history of engaging in risky sex- or drug-related behavior) and adolescent girls. In the case of teenage girls, there\u2019s no indication that a simple vaccine acts as a catalyst for sexual behavior, risky or otherwise.\nAt most, Jena\u2019s study indicated that girls who are already engaging in risky sexual behavior are more likely to get vaccinated with Gardasil. That's important for understanding the study's outcome. Girls who received the vaccine did have higher infection rates after inoculation, but they also had higher rates of STIs before they ever got the shot. Once researchers controlled for that factor, the differences between the vaccine and control groups vanished. To the extent that there\u2019s any correlation between vaccination and promiscuity, it\u2019s a heartening one: girls who might need the vaccine most are seeking it out.\nadverse reactions are real, but they're also rare\nBut the mythical connection between Gardasil and risky sexual behavior is only one part of the misinformation that plagues the shot; just as pernicious are rumors about its safety. One frequently cited (and debunked ) anecdote blames Gardasil for the death of 32 women. Some cite negative experiences that friends, family, and loved ones have had with the vaccine as a reason to steer clear. \"I got the shot, stood up, walked into Planned Parenthood\u2019s lobby to pay, and passed out, but with seizure-like symptoms. I apparently was moaning and moving around, though totally unconscious,\" AC Shilton told The Verge of her own experience with Gardasil. \"It\u2019s a total mystery as to what happened. I had never had a vaccine reaction before, have no known medical allergies and am generally a really healthy person.\" While adverse experiences like Shilton\u2019s are real, they\u2019re also rather rare \u2013 as Matthew Herper notes in Forbes, the MMR vaccine has received more than double the number of adverse effect reports as Gardasil.\nPrevalence of high-risk and low-risk types of HPV among women 14 to 59, 2003 through 2006.  (Hariri S, Unger ER, Sternberg M, Dunne EF, Swan D, Patel S, et al)\nThese fears, on examination, seem to come from a more general anxiety about science, medicine, and the effects of new technology. In talking to people with hesitations about Gardasil, I repeatedly heard refrains about how new and unproven the vaccine is. Parents cited the relatively recent release of the vaccine, ignoring the fact that Gardasil\u2019s human trials were over a decade ago \u2014 and that, aside from the virus itself, there\u2019s very little that's actually new or innovative about Gardasil at all, says Greg Moe, a scientist working with the Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland Research Institute.\nAlmost all the vaccine\u2019s ingredients \"could be found in a typical vitamin pill.\"\nThough some parents cite scary-sounding ingredients that make up Gardasil as a reason to hesitate, virtually everything found in Gardasil (including intimidating sounding items like polysorbate 80 and sodium borate) can be found in many common food products, pharmaceuticals, and even the human body. Almost all the vaccine\u2019s ingredients \"could be found in a typical vitamin pill,\" Moe says. Furthermore, the science behind Gardasil isn\u2019t particularly new: the adjuvant used to increase immune response (and create immunity), has been used for over 50 years in vaccines safely given to hundreds of millions of people; similarly, yeast-based vaccines like Gardasil have been used for decades with no ill effect.\nGiven Gardasil\u2019s safety and efficacy, only one real question remains: is wide-scale inoculation actually necessary from a public health perspective? In 2011, NPR reported that Diane Harper, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine who worked on studies that led to Gardasil\u2019s approval, had expressed reservations about mandatory Gardasil inoculation among youth. Harper had no concerns about the vaccine\u2019s safety or efficacy; she merely felt Gardasil inoculation wasn\u2019t as imperative as marketing campaigns might suggest. Even without Gardasil, Pap smears have been proven highly effective at detecting cervical cancer cells while they\u2019re in a pre-cancerous, and very treatable, stage. Similarly, genital warts \u2014 though unsightly and embarrassing \u2014 are highly treatable and rarely fatal. For these health concerns, Gardasil is less a major breakthrough than an improved solution for a problem we\u2019d already more or less solved.\nOn the left, a normal cell from a Pap smear. On the right, an HPV-infected cell. (Ed Uthman )\nBut cervical cancer and genital warts aren\u2019t the only threat posed by HPV: over the past decade, the virus has been implicated in throat and anal cancer, neither of which are as easily detected and prevented as cervical cancer.  And though Gardasil isn\u2019t the only way of preventing cervical cancer, it\u2019s far more pleasant than undergoing a colposcopy and removal of part of the cervix. Given the option, why wouldn\u2019t we want to spare adolescents the pain, suffering, and expense of having to deal with HPV?\nparents only have a limited amount of control over their children's sexual decisions\nPerhaps, it comes back to the fact that Gardasil is associated with sex, and for some parents, acknowledging their children\u2019s potential future sex lives feels a bit too much like ceding control over their children\u2019s most intimate decisions. \"Children as young as nine are urged to begin the series, with the assumption that they will be sexually active soon thereafter,\" says Erica Sandberg, a generally pro-vaccine parent \u2014 with the exception of Gardasil. \"I find that horrible. Will some? Unfortunately, yes. But I\u2019ve been highly involved with my daughter\u2019s education regarding these matters since she could speak and\u2026 I\u2019m secure that she\u2019ll make smart decisions.\"\nThe anxiety is understandable. But it stems from this unavoidable fact: parents only have a limited amount of control over their children\u2019s sexual decisions. However smart those decisions are, HPV \u2014 which can be transmitted even when condoms are used \u2014 is still a very real risk. In fact, it\u2019s the most commonly transmitted STI tracked by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one with potentially fatal consequences.\n\"Here is a therapy we have to prevent cancer, and we\u2019re not using it,\" says Jena \u2014 something that would be unthinkable were we discussing a vaccination for colon or skin cancer. Hopefully, with continued awareness and education, we\u2019ll be able to reverse that course.\n","Title":"The HPV vaccine works.
