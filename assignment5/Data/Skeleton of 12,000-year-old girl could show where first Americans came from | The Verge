{"Main text":"Next\nThat's because the skeleton, which the researchers have named Naia, has features distinct from modern Native Americans but can also be linked to them through DNA \u2014 something that hasn't been possible with earlier remains. Naia was also found in the south of Mexico, in the Yucatán Peninsula, which is far lower in the Americas than similar skeletons found so far, furthering the evidence that Paleoamericans hailed from a single origin and continued to travel.\n\"We had no idea what we might find when we initially entered the cave.\"\nThis isn't a smoking gun for that theory, but it furthers its case. \"This is one step toward resolving that question,\" Chatters says. \"This is only one step and only one individual.\" The researchers' findings are begin published today in the journal Science .\nThough Chatters is quick to hedge those results based on this work's sample size of just a single skeleton, it's still a big step toward answering a question that he's been looking into for nearly two decades. He was one of the leaders behind the 1996 discovery of and research on Kennewick Man \u2014 a skeleton over 7,000 years old that was found in Washington state and posed these same questions of ancestry. \"For the nearly 20 years since Kennewick Man turned up,\" he says, \"I've been trying to understand why they look so different.\"\nHis break came in 2007, when a group of divers discovered the pit that Naia fell into, known as Hoyo Negro (\"black hole\" in English), and found her skull near the bottom of the 100-foot-deep, bell-shaped cavern. \"We had no idea what we might find when we initially entered the cave, which is the allure of cave diving,\" Alberto Nava, part of the Bay Area Underwater Explorers team that first found Naia, says in a statement. To access the cave, the divers had to climb down a 30-foot ladder and then swim through 200 feet of tunnel before coming to the pit.\nBefore Hoyo Negro was underwater, it was more than just Naia that fell into it. Many animals fell in too, and researchers found in the pit the bones of sabertooth tigers, pumas, coyotes, and sloths, among other animals. Naia is believed to have been 15 or 16 years old when she fell in, and researchers say that may have happened anywhere between 12,000 and 13,000 years ago. Most of the skeleton still remains in the cave today, but due to unauthorized divers coming in and tampering with various remains, the researchers felt it necessary to remove Naia's skull along with four other pieces just this March.\n","Title":"Skeleton of 12,000-year-old girl could show where first Americans came from | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
