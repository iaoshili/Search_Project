{"Main text":"The creator of Minecraft outbid Beyoncé and Jay Z on this $70 million megamansion\nNew kid on the block\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBack in September, Minecraft creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson became ludicrously wealthy after  Microsoft bought the game for $2.5 billion . And as of this week, he's now the owner of a $70 million megamansion in Beverly Hills, California.  According to Curbed , it was all but expected that Beyoncé and Jay Z would win the bid, but alas, Beyoncé and Jay Z didn't make Minecraft.\nI'm just going to paste Curbed's description of the megamansion, because there's no better way to say it:\n\"It's outfitted with a candy room, a car showroom, vodka and tequila bars, a 54-foot curved glass door that opens onto the pool, eight bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, apartment-sized closets, and a movie theater, and even the listing called it 'an overwhelming sensory experience.'\"\nThat $70 million includes everything currently in the house from furniture to artwork to an 18-foot onyx dining room \u2014 \"cases of Dom Perignon were part of the deal.\" It's apparently the highest price ever paid for a house in Beverly Hills, which isn't exactly known for frugal living. It's also less than 3 percent of Minecraft's price tag.\nHey, look, you can see the M&M towers from the couch:\n\u2014 Markus Persson (@notch) December 18, 2014\nEnjoy a few more pictures, question your life choices, and  hit up Curbed to see the rest of the house.\n","Title":"The creator of Minecraft outbid Beyoncé and Jay Z on this $70 million megamansion | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
