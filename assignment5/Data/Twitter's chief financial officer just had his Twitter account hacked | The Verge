{"Main text":"Twitter's chief financial officer just had his Twitter account hacked\nNot a good look for one of the company's top executives\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTwitter's chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, cannot stop laughing. It is too funny. OMG, when did you do this? This pic of you is funny, lol. Each of these random clickbait phrases was tweeted out several times along with a link to a site called Flashscore, after Noto's Twitter account was hacked this afternoon.\nIt's not clear yet who hacked Noto or how. Back in November of 2014 he made an  infamous Direct Message fail , posting to the public what seemed to be a discussion about a potential acquisition. Twitter has had two factor authentication available since May of 2013 , but we don't know if Noto had that enabled. For the time being, the company told The Verge it has suspended his account and deleted the spam tweets while it investigates further.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
