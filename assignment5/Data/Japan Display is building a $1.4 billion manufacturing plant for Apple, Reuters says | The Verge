Apple will also invest in the $1.4 billion plant, which will be used to build LCD displays, according to the report. According to a report from  The Wall Street Journal, Apple will cover the construction costs for the plant, and in return get the majority of the displays it produces. Last year, Japan Display's stock tumbled after it announced it would have to delay shipments, reportedly meant for Apple, according to  Bloomberg . The new plant, which Japan Display says will increase its LCD production by 20 percent \u2014 and hopefully help avoid those kinds of delays \u2014 is expected to open in 2016.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
