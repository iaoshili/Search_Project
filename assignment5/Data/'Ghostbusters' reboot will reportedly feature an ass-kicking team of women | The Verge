{"Main text":"'Ghostbusters' reboot will reportedly feature an ass-kicking team of women\nWe're ready to believe\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA new Ghostbusters film is supposed to start  shooting next year , and it might look very different from the wisecracking crew in the first two films.  The Hollywood Reporter says that Sony is considering Paul Feig to direct a new Ghostbusters movie and that the film will be a \"reboot focusing on female Ghostbusters.\" Feig previously directed Bridesmaids and The Heat, and while THR says nothing serious has been worked out yet, Feig is Sony's first choice for the job.\nRumors of a third Ghostbusters movie have been around for a long time, and the death of Harold Ramis this year seemed to throw a wrench in the plans; Ramis co-wrote and famously starred in the first two movies as the team's intellectual powerhouse, Egon Spengler. But the project gained new hype in March when Ivan Reitman, director of the first two films, said that Ghostbusters 3 is on the way. Reitman said he planned to help find a new director and produce the movie, and Sony Pictures said it was \"eager to make this film.\"  Variety also confirmed that Sony is in talks with Feig, though it says the new film will be a total reboot and that it's not clear if Feig's film would replace Ghostbusters 3.\nNow it appears Sony not only has a frontrunner for the Ghostbusters director's chair, but an exciting new direction. It's still very early so there's no word on who might pick up the proton packs this time around, but it's still the most interesting Ghostbusters rumor we've heard yet.\n","Title":"'Ghostbusters' reboot will reportedly feature an ass-kicking team of women | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
