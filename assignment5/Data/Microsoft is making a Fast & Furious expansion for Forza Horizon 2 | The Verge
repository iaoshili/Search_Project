{"Main text":"Microsoft is making a Fast & Furious expansion for Forza Horizon 2\nAnd it looks awesome\nOh my goodness.\nOh my goodness.\nFirst spotted on Xbox's Polish site, there's a teaser for a collaboration between open-world driving simulator  Forza Horizon 2 and the Fast & Furious franchise. In the brief video, there's a loose interpretation of the scene that plays out while the credits roll in Fast Five, where Dom and Brian race head to head through twisty backroads. It looks incredible.\nThe AP reports that the expansion \u2014 Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious \u2014 is set before the events of Furious 7, where the player needs to get vehicles in France to Tej (played by Ludacris). The expansion's producers were given early access to details of the movie, and it features a number of vehicles recreated right from the set including a \u201998 Supra, a \u201970 Road Runner, and a \u201970 Cuda. Dom would be proud.\nIt'll be available for download on March 27th, and it'll be free through to the launch of Furious 7 on April 3rd, after which it'll be a $10 add-on.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
