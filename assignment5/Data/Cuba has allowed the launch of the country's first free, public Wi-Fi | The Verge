Recently, a cultural center in Havana began rolling out access to free, public Wi-Fi \u2014 the first of its kind in Cuba. The country currently prioritizes its limited bandwidth for schools and businesses, but this is the first time the Cuban government has allowed a free, public Wi-Fi hub,  AP reports .\nIt's slow, but significant\nThe cultural center is run by the Cuban visual artist Kcho, who has ties to the state government. Last month, Fidel Castro appeared at the public opening of the cultural center,  AP reports . The center's free Wi-Fi comes from Kcho's personal, government-authorized internet connection, which runs at a speed of 2 Mbps. Although that may sound pretty slow to internet users in other parts of the world \u2014 globally, average internet speeds  are around 3.9 Mbps \u2014 it's a huge boon for Cuba, where much of the population still has no internet access at all.\nLast month, the state-run telecom provider ETECSA announced plans to  begin offering Wi-Fi service in the country's second largest city, Santiago de Cuba. But pay-to-play Wi-Fi, which reportedly runs for around $4.50 per hour, can be exorbitantly costly for Cuban citizens  making just $20 a month . The AP estimates Kcho is likely paying around $900 a month for his connection.\nKcho told the AP that because dozens of users are connecting to the center's Wi-Fi at any given time, the signal strength is often weak. But in a place where citizens typically need  government approval to install a router, a diluted Wi-Fi connection is better than none at all.\n\"It is expensive, but the benefit is tremendous,\" Kcho told the AP. \"I have something that is great and powerful. I can share it, and I am doing so.\"\n","Title":"Cuba has allowed the launch of the country's first free, public Wi-Fi | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","tech"]}
