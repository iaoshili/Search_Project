{"Main text":"Tumblr raises the alarm for net neutrality\n(again)\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBetween  the SOPA blackout and the  day of action for net neutrality , big names on the internet like Reddit, Netflix, and Tumblr have harnessed their vast platforms to call their users into action. Today, Tumblr continued that recent tradition by placing a big yellow button in everyone's dashboard that says \"SAVE THE INTERNET.\" The button directs users to a site that explains the net neutrality issue, and asks them to \" help the FCC protect the internet .\"\nOnce again, Tumblr wants its users to contact government officials to influence net neutrality policy. In an official post, Tumblr writes:\nThis is it, guys. We\u2019ve been been fighting this fight together for a long time now. You did a sensationally good job back in September, making 135,343 calls in a single day and shifting the political momentum back toward real internet freedom. You have been pulling more and more policymakers \u2014 including the president himself \u2014 over to the side of internet freedom. We\u2019re almost there. Let\u2019s bring this one home.\nIt's a timely call to action. The FCC is expected to propose that ISPs be reclassified as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act: a contentious move that big internet providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have been fighting in the courts and in Congress. That proposal could leak as early as this week, and then the FCC will vote on it during a February 26th meeting.\nThis time, Tumblr isn't asking people to call the FCC. Instead, it's directing them to members of Congress. That's a smart move, considering the fact that the Republican-controlled Congress is skeptical of the FCC's authority. Moreover, Congress is considering independent action that could take the decision on net neutrality  out of the FCC's hands .\nSo far we've seen that companies like Tumblr can  generate lots of internet comments . We'll find out soon if they can actually make a difference.\n","Title":"Tumblr raises the alarm for net neutrality | The Verge","Tags":["web","policy","culture","us-world"]}
