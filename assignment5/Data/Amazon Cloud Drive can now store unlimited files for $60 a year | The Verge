{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAmazon is making cloud storage a whole lot more affordable. It's overhauling the pricing structure for  Cloud Drive today to offer two unlimited storage plans \u2014 neither of which is very expensive. For $11.99 per year, Amazon is offering unlimited photo storage and 5GBs of storage for anything else you want to host online. For $59.99, Amazon will host anything you want, with no storage limit. Those prices are a lot less expensive than what you'll find from many of Amazon's biggest competitors, including iCloud, Google Drive, and Dropbox. Microsoft also  offers unlimited cloud storage (alongside access to Office 365), though it costs a small amount more.\nEven though Amazon may be taking the lead in a big way on pricing, that doesn't make it a clear winner in cloud storage. Amazon is still at a disadvantage when it comes to integration. Apple has integrated iCloud relatively seamlessly throughout iOS, so many people are using it without even knowing it. Google can do the same with Drive on Android. And while Dropbox isn't default to any platform, it's almost become the de facto integration for many apps because of how widely used it is. Amazon doesn't have any of that (unless you're on a Kindle Fire), which largely makes this siloed off storage. That'll be fine for many, but it's not optimal and not where cloud storage is headed. Still, those prices will be hard to ignore by anyone looking to store files online.\n","Title":"Amazon Cloud Drive can now store unlimited files for $60 a year | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
