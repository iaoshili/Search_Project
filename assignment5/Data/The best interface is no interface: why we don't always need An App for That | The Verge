That may or may not be an app on your smartphone \u2014 Krishna doesn\u2019t want to go back to the flip-phone age, he just thinks lots of companies and designers are defaulting to using screens and apps when that actually makes the task you\u2019re trying to accomplish more difficult.\nThe thoughts Krishna lays out in the chapter we\u2019ve excerpted from his book below are particularly relevant right now, given the attention being lavished on Apple and its UI-heavy smartwatch. \u201CA fair amount of the articles about actual use cases [for the Apple Watch] show off standard, screen-intensive interactions,\u201D Krishna said over email. \u201CHere are all the screens you have to use to hail a cab on Uber. Here's how Facebook notifications look. Your Instagram feed. They\u2019re boring \u2014 and repetitive to what a smartphone already offers.\u201D\nRegardless of the feeling that we\u2019re at \u201Cpeak screen\u201D so to speak, Krishna\u2019s hopeful that things will begin to even out \u2014 and he sees that a younger generation might be the catalysts behind it. \u201CThe young don't admire swiping and tapping like their parents,\u201D he says. \u201CThere's nothing novel about another screen to either.\u201D It\u2019s similar to how teenagers are slowly abandoning Facebook . It\u2019s more and more taken over by their parents, and other services and apps are leaner and better-designed for the things they care about: messaging and images.\nThe following chapter from The Best Interface is No Interface is called \u201CScreen-based thinking: Let\u2019s make an app!\u201D In it, Krishna lays out probably his worst-case scenario for app- and screen-based thinking, showing exactly how some companies are getting it wrong. It\u2019s a scenario Krishna has been sharing for years, but it\u2019s no less effective and illuminating today. He also offers a bit of hope, showing how interface designers can actually build things that make our lives easier \u2014 without needing an app to do it.\nScreen-based thinking: Let's make an app!\nSomewhere, at some point in time, we fell in love.\nI really don\u2019t know when. Like all relationships, it seemed to happen in the blink of an eye \u2014 from the blur of whatever we were doing before, to a passionate, unquestioning love for the modern, handsome, beautiful interface of the moment: apps.\nMaybe it was these gently whispered sweet nothings from all the way back in 2009:\n\"What\u2019s great about the iPhone is that if you want to check snow conditions on the mountain, there\u2019s an app for that.\"\nForget that the National Ski & Snowboard Retailers Association reported that only 2.6 percent of Americans actually downhill ski \u2014 or that they did so only about eight days a year when these nothings were first whispered. When we heard that siren song, nothing else mattered. Love and reason? Well, they\u2019re like oil and vinegar.\nThe commercial continued. Our pulses quickened. \"And if you want to check where exactly you parked the car...\"\nDon\u2019t tease me. We all know how to end that phrase. Six beautiful trademarked words that may have unintentionally fenced in this generation\u2019s limitations on technological creativity.\nThere's an app for that.TM\nShallow, skin-deep apps\nForget that 780 million people in the world, give or take, don't have access to clean drinking water, or that more than half a million people are homeless in the wealthy United States. We moved way past \"mundane\" social issues and collectively propelled the technology field \u2014 where disruption and innovation have a proven track record of changing everyday lives \u2014 to giving the world what it really needs: more mobile apps.\nBut not ideal, meaningful, invisible apps running quietly and efficiently on your smartphone, smartwatch, or tablet. Instead, shallow, skin-deep apps that seductively offer the life-affirming, itch-scratching swipes and two-finger pinches that the world needs, wants, and craves.\nLove is patient. Love is kind. Love is 99 cents to download.\nName a news source. Odds are they have a recent article, column, or perhaps an entire section devoted to swooning over the latest apps. It may be because reporters want to showcase that they\u2019re hip \u2014 yeah, we know apps \u2014 but it\u2019s probably because they\u2019re also love drunk with touchscreen oxytocin.\nAn app, just by being an app, doesn\u2019t guarantee that it produces anything of merit to anyone anywhere, but please \u2014 shh! \u2014 we must defend our loved one\u2019s honor. An app\u2019s creation is told as a gospel of wonder and miracle: we\u2019re blessed that someone wrote working code that somehow illuminated the dark, mythical path to Apple or Google\u2019s app catalog.\nLove Drunk with Touchscreen oxytocin\nThe New York Times featured an \"App of the Week,\" and had a recurring \"App Smart Extra\" column with heart-throbbing titles like \"A Weather App That Works.\" It works!? What glorious times with our love.\nAnd during the financial crisis, The New York Times featured a Bloomberg app as \"App of the Week\" because it revealed \"basic stock market data.\" What? Extraordinary!\nPerhaps you, too, poured a glass of Chablis and cued up Norah Jones to set the mood as you reread the touching USA Today piece, \"5 New Apps That Will Change Your Life.\" My heart melts at that opening line: \"Apps, apps, and more apps . . . truly life changing.\"\nOr maybe you\u2019re thinking, \"Oh, I\u2019ll just turn on talking head CNN and forget about my app muse.\" Think again, my friend. Here are real CNN headlines.\nStuck in snow? There's an app for that.\nMoody? There's an app for that.\nStaying safe in danger zones? There's an app for that.\nRemote sex? There's an app for that.\nNo TP? There's an app for that.\nNeed to pray? There's an app for that.\nWhether you\u2019re out of toilet paper, trying to stalk someone, or are actually dead, well, \"There\u2019s an app for that.\"â„¢ Justin Bieber. One Direction. God. According to Google Trends, none has been as popular a search term as \"app.\"\nNot surprisingly, almost every major automotive company has been working on apps for smartphones. Who wouldn\u2019t want in on the love affair? And an industry that has been working on the same four-wheeled concept for over 120 years could always use some refreshing. Some of the apps touted in press releases and blogs have the ability to unlock your car doors.\n\"My BMW remote app unlocks car doors, starts the AC, and more!\"\nThis begs the question: How do you make a better car key? Most of these automotive door-opening apps work similarly, so for the sake of demonstration, let\u2019s see how amazing it was to actually use the BMW app on an iPhone when a recent version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system was launched. In Apple\u2019s words, this is \"the world\u2019s most advanced mobile OS. In its most advanced form.\"\n1. Walk up to my car.\nI walk toward my car and want to open my car door.\n2. Pull out my smartphone.\nI want to open my car door. So, I reach into my pocket and carefully pull out my smartphone because I definitely don\u2019t want to drop something made of glass and thin metal onto a cement parking lot.\n3. Wake up my phone.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, and, almost unconsciously, I regrip my smartphone to \"wake up\" my phone by pressing and clicking in the main button.\n4. Unlock my phone.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone and hit the circular Home button at the bottom of my phone for the fingerprint reader to unlock my phone.\n5. Exit my last opened app.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, I see my last opened application, and I hit the Home button to exit the application. (Hopefully I don\u2019t get distracted by my Twitter stream. Speaking of, did you see the new pictures of the royal baby? He\u2019s growing up so fast! I\u2019m sorry, what are we doing here?)\n6. Exit my last opened group.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, I see the group of applications that my last opened application was categorized under, and I press the Home button to exit the group view.\n7. Swipe through a sea of icons, searching for the app.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone and see the Home screen. I swipe right-to-left across the screen through a sea of icons, scanning their logos and the tiny type underneath, trying to find the app.\n8. Tap the app icon.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone and tap the app icon to open the car app.\n8a. ...\n...\n9. Wait for the app to load and try to find the unlock action.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone and see a beautiful map of North America.\n10. Make a guess with the menu and tap Control.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone. I\u2019ve got a lot of choices. I cross my fingers and tap the Control tab option at the bottom.\n11. Tap the Unlock button.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, and I see more choices. A button right at the top of the list says Locking\/Unlocking. I tap that.\n12. Slide the slider to unlock.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, and a two-way slider pops up with a lock icon to the left and an unlock icon to the right. I slide the slider to the right because (for those not paying attention) I want to open my car door.\n13. Physically open the car door.\nI want to open my car door. So, I look down at my phone, and it says, \"Data transfer successful.\" Not totally sure what that means, but I think that did it . . . Heaven, I\u2019m in heaven! My heart beats so that I can hardly speak. . . Yes, my doors are now unlocked, and I can open my car doors!\nWait, 13 steps?\nWhat happened here?\nThere was me, walking up to my car.  And there was my goal: to open my car door.\n(This isn\u2019t complicated.)\nWalk up to my car\nPull out my smartphone\n","Title":"The best interface is no interface: why we don't always need An App for That | The Verge","Tags":["apps","design","tech"]}
