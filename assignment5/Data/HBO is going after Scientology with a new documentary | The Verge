Gibney won his Oscar for helming the critically acclaimed documentary Taxi to the Dark Side for HBO in 2007, and was also the director of 2005's Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.\nThe book came to fruition after the bombshell New Yorker profile of Hollywood filmmaker Paul Haggis , who defected from Scientology in 2011. It's also one of the most highest-profile looks to date into the secretive organization. At the time it was published it caused such a stir that it provoked the Church of Scientology to release a statement saying it \"belongs in a supermarket tabloid.\" HBO is already preparing for a litigious response from the Church of Scientology; company president of documentary films Sheila Nevins told THR that they have \"probably 160 lawyers\" vetting the film.\n","Title":"HBO is going after Scientology with a new documentary | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
