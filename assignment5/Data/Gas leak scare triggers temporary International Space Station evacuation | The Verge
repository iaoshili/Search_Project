Space Station (@Space_Station) January 14, 2015\nBefore they returned, NASA said that onboard crew \u2014 comprising two American astronauts, one Italian astronaut, and three Russian cosmonauts \u2014 followed normal safety procedures and donned gas masks, moving to the Russian half of the ISS and sealing the American segment behind them. The flight control team in Houston reports that crew members are in \"excellent shape\" and that all other systems onboard the ISS are functioning perfectly.\nCanadian astronaut and former ISS crew member Chris Hadfield  tweeted that a leaking coolant system was one of the \"big three\" emergencies that astronauts train for on the station. \"Ammonia is used for cooling through pipes & heat exchangers on the outside of Station,\" said Hadfield. \"We train for it & the crew and MCC [mission control center] have responded well.\" He added that the other big emergencies were \"fire\/smoke\" and \"contaminated atmosphere\/medical.\"\nNASA is currently updating the situation and says that the most likely cause at this point in time is \"a faulty sensor or computer relay.\"\nUpdate: #Exp42 crew informed by controllers that it's starting to look like a false indication, either a faulty sensor or computer relay.\n","Title":"Gas leak scare triggers temporary International Space Station evacuation | The Verge","Tags":["breaking","science"]}
