{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWe've got to imagine that anyone who wanted the current incarnation of Google Glass has already purchased it by now. But if you've been saving up your change to reach the Explorer Edition's astronomical $1,500 asking price, today's your last chance to place an order on Google Play.\nAs we learned last week , once the clock strikes midnight, Google will halt sales of Google Glass  as we've come to know it over the last two years. (The Glass at Work program will continue on, however.) There's no longer any software roadmap to point to, so don't expect much in the way of improvements or new features. If you're buying Glass now, you should be happy with what it does right now. Because odds are, that's the way it's staying forever. It'll take pictures, it'll give you directions, it'll answer your search queries, and a few other things; Google says there are \"over 40\" apps that currently work with Glass.\nWould we recommend anyone blow so much cash on an end-of-life product? Absolutely not. But the Explorer Edition was never meant for your everyday consumer. For all the controversies and social awkwardness, there are people out there who genuinely love wearing and using this thing. When that's done well, Glass  brings us some pretty amazing, personal, and unique perspectives . Google insists we'll eventually see something geared at the mainstream market \u2014 under the direction of  new product lead Tony Fadell . \"You\u2019ll start to see future versions of Glass when they\u2019re ready,\" Google said on Thursday. So until Google's ready, this is the end. So long, Explorer Edition.\nVerge Video from CES 2015: Vuzik's Google Glass Competitor Finally Works\n","Title":"Today's your last chance to spend $1,500 on Google Glass | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
