{"Main text":"On set with Arnold for what could be the best Terminator in decades\nBy Jacob Kastrenakes\nArnold Schwarzenegger is walking up a flight of stairs toward a time machine, located on a large metal platform high above my head. He\u2019s banged up, with a bullet hole in the back of his jacket \u2014 a leather jacket, of course \u2014 and a bright green blob along his right cheek that looks like it\u2019s eating through his face. It all looks strange, but then you begin to see it: with some movie magic, you can imagine the green mark warping into a gory wound, with bits of muscle and metal stretching out across it.\nWith another stretch of the imagination, the entire room morphs into a futuristic laboratory, occupied by a version of Schwarzenegger that\u2019s more recognizable than any other: the Terminator.\nIt\u2019s the middle of July 2014, and I\u2019m down in New Orleans inside an enormous, white NASA warehouse. From the outside, it\u2019s nondescript enough that one might assume some strange government research is happening inside. NASA once worked on the Space Shuttle here, but these days it\u2019s regularly rented out by film crews transforming it into other worlds. Today that world is a high-tech laboratory built for the film Terminator: Genisys.\nThe Terminator franchise has been around since James Cameron\u2019s The Terminator back in 1984, but compared to today\u2019s franchises \u2014 say, anything Marvel, Star Wars, or Transformers \u2014 Terminator films are few and far between. Genisys, which comes out this summer, is only the series\u2019 fifth film, a full three decades after the first installment.\ncompared to today\u2019s franchises, Terminator films are few and far between\nThat may be because things haven\u2019t gone so well without Cameron. Cameron\u2019s Terminator 2, in 1991, duplicated the success of the original by shifting its unique mixture of sci-fi, action, horror and \u2014 yes \u2014 relationships onto a mostly new set of characters. But from there, the series went downhill. Terminator 3, released in 2003, wasn\u2019t a hit with critics or at the box office. The TV show that followed in 2008 was cancelled after two seasons.\nThen came 2009\u2019s widely panned Terminator Salvation, which  Roger Ebert described as being so filled with action scenes that it may as well have been a video game that you don\u2019t get to play (and you know how Ebert feels about video games). Salvation also did poorly at the box office, which is likely why the series\u2019 rights went up for sale shortly thereafter. Ultimately, the franchise ended up in the hands of producers David Ellison and Dana Goldberg, a duo behind a number of recent blockbusters, including Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z, which they executive produced. Ellison and Goldberg recognize that breathing life back into this flagging franchise won\u2019t be easy.\nSchwarzenegger is attempting to make a sequel that\u2019s actually good\nBut the team is committed. That\u2019s why Schwarzenegger is in this warehouse and back in his old costume. He and everyone else here are attempting to make Terminator feel fresh again \u2014 or, more succinctly, trying make a sequel that\u2019s actually good. Joining him are Emilia Clarke, better known as Daenerys in Game of Thrones, and Jai Courtney, who played Bruce Willis\u2019 son in A Good Day to Die Hard. Clarke and Courtney flank Schwarzenegger as he walks toward the time machine take after take after take.\nJust about every role has been recast for this movie, with young actors taking over as better-looking versions of Terminator\u2019s classic characters: Clarke is the increasingly tough Sarah Connor, and Courtney is the hapless Kyle Reese. Only Schwarzenegger is returning for the reboot. While some might wonder why he\u2019s still here and still playing the powerhouse role at 66 years old, the answer is obvious: It\u2019s a Terminator film. Of course he\u2019s here.\nAnd with Schwarzenegger on board, everyone in this weird hangar 20 minutes from the city center is actually excited. They all think this new film is going to succeed, and they\u2019re eager to have people forget about the franchise\u2019s missteps. Even director Alan Taylor, whose last film was 2013\u2019s Thor: The Dark World, points to the first two Terminator films as inspiration, politely ignoring the slow train wreck that followed.\nThat voluntary amnesia goes double for Schwarzenegger, who isn\u2019t just peeved about the quality of Salvation, but seems to be annoyed that they made it without him. With Genisys, Schwarzenegger says, \"[The screenwriters] really figured out a way of continuing on the story and kind of ignoring the last one.\" It\u2019s been over a decade since Schwarzenegger last touched the franchise \u2014 during much of the time since, he served as governor of California \u2014 but when asked, he admits to still feeling protective over the Terminator.\nThe trailer for the original Terminator\nEllison and Goldberg, the producers, also express a deep commitment to the quality of the franchise. While cameras are being moved around during a break in the action, the two drop by where I\u2019m standing, smiling and walking beside one another \u2014 an inseparable pair.\nBoth producers are understandably jumpy about rebooting the series \u2014 mostly out of excitement, but maybe it\u2019s their nerves, as well. They want to update Terminator for modern times, allowing it to reflect our new technology and fears. Both believe now is the moment to hit the reset button.\n\"Whenever you remake a movie there has to be a reason for doing it,\" says Ellison, who, with his gently spiked hair, looks like a startup founder (unsurprisingly, as he is the son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison). \"You have to find a way to update it and adjust and deviate, otherwise you\u2019re simply just recreating what [James] Cameron did.\"\nThe original Terminator movies were about nuclear war and the opposition of man and machine, all backed by a military AI called Skynet bent on exterminating humanity. To Ellison, that AI is starting to look less and less fictional: technology integrating itself into our lives \u2014 and sneaking into our pockets \u2014 is the reality many of us live in.\n\"We\u2019ve invited Skynet into our homes,\" Ellison says. \"We line up in front of Apple stores to buy these things. The singularity is very much in the near future. The bond of man and machine is just around the corner.\"\n\"We\u2019ve invited Skynet into our homes. We line up in front of Apple stores to buy these things.\"\nThe singularity \u2014 a term that generally refers to the emergence of hyper-intelligent AI or the merging of man and machine \u2014 is said to be a major theme in this movie. Ellison says that we\u2019re already moving in that direction with procedures like ocular implants, but even our reliance on smartphones is enough of a symbol for him and Goldberg to riff on.\n\"[Terminator] was a cautionary tale about the amount that you put your trust into a machine and technology,\" Goldberg says. \"Look at the world we live in. You can sit in a restaurant, and literally, people aren\u2019t speaking to one another because everybody is doing this,\" she says, putting her hands out as though she were firing off a text message. \"It sort of has Skynet written all over it. It was sort of asking for [a remake].\"\n\"It\u2019s even more pressing now,\" director Alan Taylor says, when he comes over during a camera movement. \"Science fiction is fun because it\u2019s reaching so far into the future. Right now, that stuff is around us all the time.\"\n\"One of the challenges was that \u2026 now we have a different set of fears [than the kind of paranoia used in Terminator 1],\" Taylor says. \"Technology is scary to us in a different way. Most people aren\u2019t lying awake at night worrying about nuclear threat, but we are unnerved by a lot of how technology is moving into our lives and starting to infuse our lives. We [the filmmakers] question whether that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\"\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a new Terminator film actually getting that thoughtful \u2014 after all, these movies are really about running away from handsome robots. And with an initial trailer for Genisys showing more ludicrous action than in any prior Terminator film, it\u2019s becoming even harder to see how carefully these ideas will fit in. Still, people are thinking about these things on set, and that should leave some hope that they\u2019ll make it into the actual picture.\nAnd you should hope that the production knows what it\u2019s doing, because there\u2019s possibly a lot more Terminator to come. Ellison\u2019s sister, Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures, won a bid for rights to the Terminator series back in 2011. She\u2019s since passed the rights to her brother David\u2019s production house, Skydance, which plans to take advantage of the next few years in a big way. Genisys, as its name implies, is the start of something: a brand new trilogy. Assuming that this first one\u2019s successful, a second and third film will shoot back to back. Their plots are already nailed down, but no details have been released publicly.\nIn concept, this trilogy will coexist with the original set of Terminator films thanks to some complicated time travel jiu-jitsu. The mechanics sound fairly convoluted, but in short the new trilogy essentially takes place in an alternate Terminator universe. Schwarzenegger was sent back in time, but then something different happened \u2014 the timelines split. A straight reboot might have been more elegant, but Ellison and Goldberg seem to care deeply about preserving the canon that\u2019s already been created. They\u2019re also huge time travel nerds.\n\"Both of us have read just about every book you can on theatrical time travel,\" Ellison says.\nGoldberg confirms this. \"We have no lives.\"\nThe plots of Genisys' sequels are already nailed down, but no details have been released\nGenisys will feature a lot of time travel, even beyond this splitting of the timelines. After watching a few more takes with Schwarzenegger, a studio representative leads me out through a pair of doors and into a damp tunnel with cement bricks arching overhead. It\u2019s the dimly lit set of an empty sewer system, and at the center of it is yet another large platform housing a time machine. This one, meant to exist in the year 1984, is in slight disrepair. Beyond the sewer system, in another corner of the warehouse, is a final time machine, a far sleeker and more futuristic model, standing half-constructed, having finished filming days ago. In the movie, it\u2019ll show up sometime in 2029.\nOn the way back to the original time machine, we pass about a dozen extras standing around in white labs suits, one of whom is smoking a long, silver e-cig. It\u2019s a ridiculous sight, but it\u2019s also another reminder of the growing symbiosis between man and machine. Not man and machinery \u2014 not the large churning factory parts we saw at the end of the first Terminator. Skynet has manifested itself as an endless host of tiny, personal tools. They know us. And how we reach that point has always been part of what Terminator explores.\nThe rest of the day, I\u2019m whisked around through prop trailers and past catering tables, getting a look at everything from laser guns to chocolate-covered pretzels. Just before it\u2019s time to leave, Schwarzenegger has finally finished walking up all the stairs. He heads over to the side of the warehouse and takes a seat in a tall director\u2019s chair. He\u2019s cooling off, taking a few minutes to chat as it begins to rain outside, breaking New Orleans\u2019 thick blanket of heat.\nIntimidating as Schwarzenegger is, he\u2019s remarkably friendly. He still carries himself like a politician and knows how to sound measured \u2014 even when his passion for the series seems to make that difficult. Finally, a reporter asks him whether he thinks this movie will actually be able to win over fans.\nSchwarzenegger, still in costume with that green blob on his cheek, doesn\u2019t hesitate. \"I think actions speak louder than words,\" he says. \"When the movie\u2019s trailer comes out, I think that right away it will set the record straight.\"\nOf course, a first trailer is already out there, and reactions are decidedly mixed. It\u2019s over the top, it\u2019s action-packed, and it\u2019s deeply nostalgic \u2014 but maybe that\u2019s where, for better or worse, this production hopes to succeed.\n\"When you see the first screenings out there,\" Schwarzenegger adds, \"the buzz will take care of the rest.\"\nEven if Genisys is little more than a ridiculous pastiche of classic scenes that were well made the first time around, that at least means pieces of the movie are worth looking forward to. Perhaps that\u2019s why Schwarzenegger is so confident. \"I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s difficult to win the people over, because people are really excited about another Terminator,\" he says. \"They\u2019re ready to see another one.\"\n","Title":"On set with Arnold: Can Schwarzenegger bring back the glory days of Terminator? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","features","entertainment","longform"]}
