{"Main text":"Rihanna destroys Paris in Dreamworks' upcoming 'Home'\nTalk about disturbia\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat to do, when you find the Louvre in a hopeless place? It's up to Rihanna to save the world in Home,  an upcoming animated buddy comedy from Dreamworks, and a new clip shown at Comic-Con today finds the character she plays turning Paris upside-down. Rihanna plays Tip, who teams up with an outcast alien named Oh to stop an alien race named the Boov from relocating humanity. In the clip shown at Comic-Con, Tip and Oh find themselves surrounded at the Eiffel Tower, which the aliens have set up as a radio transmission tower floating above the city.\nRihanna's character springs into action, using alien technology to turn the Eiffel Tower upside town. A wild chase follows, during which big chunks of Paris are turned into rubble. The good news for humanity is that (spoiler!) their escape appears to be successful, and the rude boys on the alien side retreat to fight another day. Home is based on the children's book  The True Meaning of Smekday , and it is scheduled to come out next June.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
