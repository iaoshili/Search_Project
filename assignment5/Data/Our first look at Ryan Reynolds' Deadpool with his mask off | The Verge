{"Main text":"Our first look at Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool with his mask off\nFace off\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nI know some of our readers who are also Deadpool fans would prefer that any bit of information pertaining to the upcoming Ryan Reynolds film not be spoiled. So here's a warning: I'm about to show you a handful of photos taken from the film's set, and the last photo features Deadpool, as played by Ryan Reynolds (or maybe his stunt double), with his mask off.\nIn his origin story, Deadpool acquired a unique healing ability from the Weapon X program, the same program that gave Wolverine his adamantium skeleton. The ability cured the character's cancer, but deformed him horrifically in the process. Judging from this set photo, Reynolds won't be quite as mutilated. Then again, this is the earliest of looks at the character.\nOn April 1st, the character \"killed\" Mario Lopez in a cheeky video, and possibly announced the film would be rated R \u2014 it was April Fools' Day, so we remain skeptical.
