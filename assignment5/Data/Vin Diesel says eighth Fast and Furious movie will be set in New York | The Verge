{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Fast and Furious crew is headed to Manhattan. During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel meant to promote Furious 7, which hits theaters Friday, Vin Diesel teased that an eighth installment \u2014 yet to be officially confirmed \u2014 will be set in New York.\nJust imagine the NYC action sequences\nAnd Kurt Russell, who joined the series cast in Furious 7 as a mysterious government agent, will apparently play a significant role come the eighth film.Â \"Kurt Russell came in for this movie,\" Vin Diesel told Kimmel. \"But we really hired him because of a story that follows this that takes place in New York.\" Russell appeared on Kimmel's show just one night later, and seemed smitten with the character he portrayed. \"We created somebody that I think is a mystery man,\" he said. \"You never know his name. You never know quite what world he\u2019s in. And we don\u2019t, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting about it.\"\nA Q&A with Dennis McCarthy, the man behind Furious 7's insane cast of cars\nBeyond the location, Vin Diesel didn't offer any more hints of what's to come when Dom and his pals attempt to push supercars to their limit and tear through midtown Manhattan gridlock. A blistering race through the Lincoln Tunnel or across the George Washington Bridge both seem like child's play for this franchise. Dropping cars out of airplanes just has a way of setting the bar pretty high for James Wa (should the director return for another go) and the rest of the Fast and Furious team. \"If they do more, and if it goes on, we\u2019ll try to come up with something to top this, but I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s going to be hard to do,\" said Russell. But the beauty is you know they'll try \u2014 and probably pull it off.\n","Title":"Vin Diesel says eighth Fast and Furious movie will be set in New York | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment","transportation"]}
