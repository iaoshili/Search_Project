The movie uses this absurd concept as a way to explore identity and general human emotion \u2014 but it also made sure to find out what would happen if Malkovich entered his own mind.\nLadies and gentlemen, that world now exists. It resides in Chicago.\nMalkovich and photographer Sandro Miller has recreated dozens of famous photographs where the main subject is replaced, appropriately enough, with John Malkovich. So now you can see Malkovich as Che Guevara, Muhammad Ali, Andy Warhol, naked John Lennon, Albert Einstein, and on multiple occasions Marilyn Monroe \u2014 and more. There's over 30 photographs in all, which you can  see for yousrelf on Edelman Gallery's website (somewhat NSFW).\nBased on Diane Arbus' 1967 photograph \"Identical Twins\"\nAccording to Being John Malkovich director Spike Jonze , while working on the film, \"[Malkovich] said: either the movie's a bomb and it's got not only my name above the title but my name in the title, so I'm fucked that way; or it does well and I'm just forever associated with this character.\" It was the latter.\n\"Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich\" is on display at Chicago's Catherine Edelman gallery from November 7th through January 31st, 2015.\n","Title":"John Malkovich is art \u2014 and also a nude John Lennon | The Verge","Tags":["photography","culture","tldr","entertainment"]}
