{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nRemember when the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were announced last year, and people weren't sure just how much bigger they were? Crafty individuals came up with printable versions of the phones you could make at home to get an idea before the phones hit stores. Now Apple's done one better for the Apple Watch using its own shopping app. 9to5Mac has spotted a rather simple tool in Apple's own store app that lets you see both the 38mm and 42mm variants of the Apple Watch represented at their actual size. It figures out what iPhone you have, and will scale them accordingly. It's also the most affordable way to get an idea of what the $12,000, 18-Karat rose gold model would look like on your body.\nHilariously imperfect when using a larger iPhone\nThe tool is hilariously imperfect if you have a larger iPhone like the 6 or the 6 Plus, but you can actually put it up to your arm like you would a watch to get a feel for its scale. The same thing is not possible if you're checking out the two sizes on an iPad, where they simply show up side-by-side in the middle of the screen.\nAll this will be less useful when the Apple Watch arrives in stores next month . While announcing additional pricing and information about its features yesterday, Apple said it plans to have the watch available for preorder and display in stores come April 10th. It actually goes on sale April 24th.\n","Title":"Apple's Store App lets you check out Apple Watch sizes on your wrist | The Verge","Tags":["apple","tech"]}
