In fact, it's a very quick one: it'll race from 0 to 60 in just 4.2 seconds when equipped with the 85 kilowatt-hour performance drivetrain, which is faster than just about everything else on the road shy of exotics and high-end sports cars. But a new startup \u2014 based right in Tesla's backyard \u2014 is poised to make the Model S look a bit slow.\nThe simply-named Coupe comes from Renovo , which says it has been working on the car and its drivetrain in \"stealth mode\" for the last four years. If it looks familiar, it should: it's basically a Shelby Daytona with the gasoline-sucking bits replaced by a crazy electric drivetrain promising over 500 horsepower and 1,000 ft-lb. of torque (by comparison, the Model S tops out at 416hp and 443 ft-lb.). That's enough to move it from 0 to 60 in \"under\" 3.4 seconds, according to Renovo's literature.\nOf course, a direct comparison to the Model S sedan isn't really fair \u2014 this is a sports car through and through, and it's a testament to the fact that EVs aren't just for normals who want to save on gas. (It's also easy to forget that Tesla itself cut its teeth on a tiny two-place roadster.) Renovo is promising a 30-minute fast charge, a top speed north of 120mph, and a 100-mile range \u2014 well short of the 200-plus needed to turn this into a long-haul daily driver. For the wealthy buyers the company is likely targeting at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance this weekend, though, this isn't a first car \u2014 it's a second or third.\nRenovo is promising the first Coupe deliveries in 2015; in the meantime, see the full photo gallery below. Pre-sales of the half-million dollar exotic begin this weekend.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"The $529,000 Renovo Coupe will do smoky burnouts around a Tesla Model S | The Verge","Tags":["photo-essay","design","transportation"]}
