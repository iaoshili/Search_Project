{"Main text":"Google\u2019s hilarious autocomplete suggestions have been turned into a game\nBut it's not very fun\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nFor anyone who's ever taken a screenshot of a strange Google autocomplete suggestion, or realized the rest of the world was also staying up late conducting internet research on body hair, here's a game for you. It's calledÂ  Google Feud , and it's pretty much exactly what it sounds like. Like Family Feud, the game presents the first half of a phrase and players must guess the second half based on their limited knowledge of what the rest of the human race is thinking.\nUsers collect what seem to be arbitrarily determined points for each correct answer. The game gathers answers from Google's API, so the results are a real-time depiction of what the world is Googling. Problem is, trying to guess the second half of a phrase gets dull pretty quickly, and if you win, all you get is a vague satisfaction that you're tuned into the thoughts of the internet.\nThe site also features a very realistic warning message: \"Beware, certain results may be offensive and\/or incomprehensible.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
