{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAudi put a big exclamation point on its self-driving technology \u2014  \"piloted driving,\" as the company calls it \u2014 with an adrenaline-filled demonstration in Germany over the weekend. The car in question was a 560-horsepower RS7 rounding the course at Hockenheimring during the finale of this year's DTM season (DTM is a little bit like a German NASCAR, so the right audience was certainly on-hand for this sort of thing). The car was going full-out, guided through a combination of precision GPS and 3D cameras. The in-car footage showing the view out of the windshield at triple-digit speeds with no one in the driver's seat is nothing short of terrifying.\nCar companies are increasingly relying on extreme demonstrations of self-driving to show that the technology is progressing \u2014 they've moved beyond basic scenarios into the edge cases, pushing hardware and software to their limits. The logic, of course, is that if a self-driving car can handle a course at race speeds, it can certainly handle a highway. BMW did something similar at CES earlier this year with  a self-drifting car at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\nAudi claims that its RS7 demo is officially the \"fastest autonomous car on the planet.\"\nThe #RS7 topped 149 MPH at Hockenheim. Officially, the fastest autonomous car on the planet. http:\/\/t.co\/5eNIJauuNd pic.twitter.com\/vH1Ikb1JCJ\n","Title":"Watch a self-driving Audi become 'the fastest autonomous car on the planet' | The Verge","Tags":["transportation"]}
