The tenfold spike measured in the atmosphere around the lander, along with organic molecules in a rock-powder sample the robot's drill collected, provide the strongest evidence yet for life on Mars.\nthe finding is in contrast to data from 2013\nThe finding is in sharp contrast to a 2013 read-out that suggested there wasn't enough methane on Mars to support living microbes \u2014 only 1.3 parts per billion. Using Curiosity's onboard sample analysis a dozen times over 20 months showed spikes in late 2013 and early 2014, with measurements finding an average of 7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere. With more readings, it may be possible to tell if the emissions came from a biological source by testing the types of isotopes that appear in the gas.\nA diagram showing possible methane sources (NASA)\n\"This temporary increase in methane \u2014 sharply up and then back down \u2014 tells us there must be some relatively localized source,\" says Sushil  Atreya of the University of Michigan and a member of the  Curiosity rover science team, in a a statement from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"There are many possible sources,  biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock.\"\nThat's not all. Curiosity drilled at a Martian formation called the Cumberland and found different organic chemicals in a power made from the mudstone \u2014 the first definitive finding of organic materials on the planet, according to a second study, which was presented at the American Geophysical Union and is pending publication. That's not a smoking gun for life, though \u2014 the organics could have been delivered by meteorites. Material from the Cumberland rock also suggested that the lakebed lost much of its water before the rock formed, and continued to lose water afterwards.\n","Title":"Mars rover finds methane spike on Mars, but no smoking gun for life | The Verge","Tags":["science"]}
