Verizon Wireless has advertised for over a year that it covers precisely that many Americans with LTE, but now the government officially approves of that figure, according to the latest data from the Commerce Department. Back in 2011, when President Obama first announced that milestone as one of the administration's goals, the nation's largest carrier provided LTE to just over half of the US population. 3G service, meanwhile, was available to only 95 percent of the population. The administration provided $7 billion in funding to help bring wireless networks up to speed across the nation, and it credits its high-profile spectrum auctions with helping make nationwide LTE a reality.\nBroadband in the US still lags behind other nations\nIn addition, the administration points out that last month the FCC struck down laws restricting broadband growth in two the of 19 states that were called out as part of his broadband plan earlier this year. There's also a new policy being put in place today that will bring $35 million in loans to help promote broadband infrastructure in rural areas of Arkansas, New Mexico, and Iowa. Of course, despite these gains, the US broadband stillÂ  ranks low among the most developed nations in the world \u2014 but there's no quick fix for that.\nVerge Video: The History of Net Neutrality\n","Title":"Obama administration reaches goal to provide LTE to 98 percent of Americans | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","us-world","tech"]}
