Now Japan's prime minister wants to take that idea to the largest stage possible. Speaking to reporters last weekend at a robot factory north of Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was reported by Jiji Press (via  the Telegraph ) as saying: \"In 2020 I would like to gather all of the world's robots and aim to hold an Olympics where they compete in technical skill.\"\nTokyo is already hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics, but presumably the robot competition would be a separate event. Will it be like  BattleBots or more like  DARPA's Robotics Challenge , or something else entirely (this may be the only time a  Real Steel reference is appropriate in a news article)? So far, Abe's idea is a mere utterance and remains firmly in the realm of science fiction. But with  Switzerland planning to hold the first Olympic games for athletes with robotic prosthetics in 2016 (a so-called \" cyborg Olympics \"), Abe's idea may not be that difficult to pull off.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
