Unveiled this week, the concept SUV \u2014 or SUC (Sports Utility Coup√©) as the German carmaker calls it \u2014 boasts all sorts of futuristic features. It runs on a hybrid engine, but it's not your typical hybrid: the back wheels are powered by an electric motor while the front wheels are driven by a turbocharged hydrogen combustion engine. The electric motor's power comes from the typical sources like regenerative braking and plug-in technology, but also comes from the paint job.\nMercedes-Benz has dubbed the paint a \"multi-voltaic silver\" finish, and it not only acts as a solar cell but can also generate an electrostatic charge from the wind that the car slices through. The suspension also dynamically generates a charge, meaning there's some electricity being created with almost every movement the Vision G-Code makes.\nThe most visually striking feature of the Vision G-Code's design is the continuous glass that stretches from the driver's side window all the way around the windshield to the passenger side. Mercedes-Benz likens it to the look of the type of windshield found on a powerboat, but science-fiction fans might think it looks more like a Cylon Raider .\nAs with most concept cars, we'll likely never see a perfect mass production version of the G-Code, but the hope is that many of the smart ideas strewn throughout the design end up in some (if not all) of Mercedes-Benz's models in the future. Until that happens, all we can do is drool over the photos and daydream about driving it.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"Mercedes-Benz has a new concept car powered by its paint job | The Verge","Tags":["concepts","design","transportation"]}
