{"Main text":"MH370 satellite data is now available to amateur sleuths\nExperts say plane was out of fuel by final transmission\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Malaysian government today  published a 47-page report detailing the final automated communications of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  According to Australian air-accident analysts , the report \u2014 which shows the automatic \"pings\" of information that travelled between the aircraft and a satellite belonging to British firm Inmarsat \u2014 suggests that the aircraft had likely run out of fuel and was descending at the time it sent its last update. The raw data was  published by Malaysia's department of civil aviation after families of the jet's missing passengers pressured the country's government for greater transparency in its investigation.\nAustralian analysts still believe the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, but the country's naval vessel Ocean Shield is set to abandon its search on Wednesday after a fruitless search \u2014 a week before authorities will open up the hunt for the missing craft to private contractors. In the meantime, experts are combing through today's data in an attempt to find a clue as to flight 370's fate.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
