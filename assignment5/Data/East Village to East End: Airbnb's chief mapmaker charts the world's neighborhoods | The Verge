{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWith more than 500,000 rooms available to rent on any given night, Airbnb now ranks among the largest hospitality companies in the world. But the homes and apartments on Airbnb aren\u2019t owned by employees, so it can be tough for the fast-growing startup to control the experience being delivered to customers. In an effort to help ensure travelers get a stay suited to their tastes, it rolled out the  Neighborhood Project , which charts the character of its numerous locations.\nAnd that\u2019s where Zach Walker, Airbnb\u2019s lone cartographer, comes in. In little more than a year on the job, Walker has helped slice and dice more than 70 big cities into 4,500 distinct neighborhoods with their own personalities. \"It used to be when you searched for places to stay in New York, the first thing that came up was a bunch of listings in Times Square, the most generic location, \" explains Walker. \"You could organize by price, but not much more. As we\u2019ve rolled out neighborhoods, people are increasingly booking stays way off the beaten path. It\u2019s opening up the whole city to them.\"\n\"People are increasingly booking stays way off the beaten path.\"\nThe impact on business, according to Airbnb, has been significant. Neighborhood listings are driving new visitors to the company\u2019s properties through web searches for specific hot spots. And neighborhoods have become the number one criteria renters use when booking, as lesser know areas that once would have seemed unwelcoming or unsafe to travelers are transformed into hip locales in  the process.\n\"Neighborhoods are the layering of history and culture onto geography,\" says Timothy Crimmins, director of the Center for Neighborhood and Metropolitan Studies at Georgia State University. This identity can have great value as a brand, something Airbnb has leveraged through Webster's maps. \"When you help people to connect with the character of a neighborhood, it can be a real catalyst for business and development, or in this case for tourism.\"\nWalker didn\u2019t know much about map making when he first arrived in Manhattan as a newly minted college grad with degrees in physics and creative writing. But he responded to a Craigslist ad from a startup called Nabewise, a service that created detailed profiles of neighborhoods to help people decide where to move. He fell in love with charting the makeup of big cities. \"Each city has its own personality, from the way it\u2019s constructed and organized to the way people and goods flow through.\"\nIn July of 2012,  Airbnb acquired Nabewise and Walker became their resident map maker. \"In a way it\u2019s a tough job because you are trying to define something amorphous,\" he explains. There is rarely an official boundary for where one neighborhood begins and another ends. \"I try to get into the mind of the city as if it were a living, breathing thing,\" says Walker. He reads up on the area\u2019s history and cross references that with the information from Airbnb\u2019s hosts, crafting data visualizations of keywords from the listings written by users.\n\"Sometime they have a real argument about the dividing lines, but usually they just want to charge more.\"\n\"In an ancient city like London, where the roads turn in on themselves, it can be mind boggling to try and figure out when you\u2019re in Shoreditch and when you\u2019ve crossed over to Brick Lane,\" says Walker. \"But by studying the data from hundreds of users, the descriptions they use of their own homes, I can begin to see where the shifts occur.\"\nWhen Walker does his job right, a few people usually get angry. He takes neighborhood boundaries that are flexible and porous and replaces them with rigid lines. \"People get upset, they write in to complain: \u2018Hey my place should be in the East Village,\u2019 when really it's not,\" says Walker. \"Sometimes they have a real argument about the dividing lines, but usually they just want to charge more.\" But while a few renters are making less these days, overall Airbnb believes mapping the world is providing a big boost to its business.\n","Title":"East Village to East End: Airbnb's chief mapmaker charts the world's neighborhoods | The Verge","Tags":["report","design","business"]}
