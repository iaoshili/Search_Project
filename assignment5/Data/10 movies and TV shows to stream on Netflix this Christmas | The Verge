Marco Polo may not have turned out so well , but Netflix has still added a pretty great selection of new and classic movies over the past month. Here are 10 favorites for you to consider when you're searching for something to watch.\nThe one for when all the other sci-fi isn\u2019t dark enough for you: Black Mirror\nThis is the British sci-fi series that has everyone talking. Black Mirror just hit Netflix this month, making the holidays your perfect chance to catch up. It\u2019s a show about our obsession with technology and how the effects of that can easily get out of hand. Things get pretty crazy, pretty quickly. Just watch it.\nThe one for when you\u2019re trying to convince your parents that climate change is getting out of hand: Snowpiercer\nIf you aren't familiar with director Bong Joon-ho, now's the time to make your introduction. Snowpiercer, his first English-language film, came out this summer and is now on Netflix. It's a smart, energetic, and action-packed sci-fi picture with great directing and a cool enough world (literally just a giant, futuristic train) to keep you onboard for the entire ride.\nThe one for when you could use more Kevin Spacey: American Beauty\nIf you don\u2019t care for ponderous meditations on plastic bags wafting in the breeze, you at least have to give Kevin Spacey his due for his incredible performance in this movie. American Beauty follows Lester Burnham, a suburban milquetoast who falls in love with his underage daughter\u2019s friend, catalyzing his need to reinvent himself. It\u2019s stylistically striking, funny, and heartbreaking in ways you\u2019ve heard all about before, but should experience if you\u2019ve never had the opportunity.\nThe one for when you\u2019ve had too much to drink: The Wolf of Wall Street\nMartin Scorsese's latest film is a wild one. Like, seriously, parents: don't watch this with your kids, and kids: don't watch this with your parents. But maybe find someone you're comfortable with and take a look. It's a strange, overlong send-up of everything that's wrong with Wall Street, and it's all at once alluring and infuriating to watch.\nThe one for when you think rock and roll is dead: Almost Famous\nCameron Crowe's classic about rock and roll and growing up, Almost Famous is a must-watch if it's somehow still on your to-watch list and an obvious re-watch if you just haven't seen it in a while. Just check outÂ  that soundtrack and cast . What's not to like?\nThe one for when you could listen to Queen anywhere: A Knight's Tale\nA Knight's Tale is both terrible and delicious. In fact, the reason it's delicious is every bit a product of how terrible it is. The constant rock music \u2014 and dance breaks to rock music \u2014 in the middle of Medieval England are key, but so is Heath Ledger's haircut and Shannyn Sossamon's anachronistic fashion. After all, A Knight's Tale isn't a drama. The love story and Ledger's quest to win a jousting tournament are important, but they ultimately takes a backseat to the comedy. No one watches A Knight Tale to be serious. You watch it for the fighting, for the early 2000s heartthrobs, and for Alan Tudyk's brilliant slapstick comedic performance.\nThe one for when you want something a little more serious: Ida\nIda follows a woman who is just days from becoming a nun when she discovers that her birth parents were Jews. It's a film about life in Poland years after the Holocaust, but it's also about one woman, Ida, figuring out who she is and what her vows really mean. It's easily among the most beautiful films you'll see this year.\nThe one for when you need something spooky to binge on: American Horror Story: Coven\nFor many AHS fans, this is where things started to go off the rails, but that doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t incredible moments and performances. As with previous seasons of this anthology series, Coven follows the descendents of Salem witches who wield powerful and deadly magic. As with all Ryan Murphy shows, there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s over the top, but Kathy Bates, who won an Emmy for this season, makes up for it.\nThe one for when you\u2019re a bit of a foodie: The Trip to Italy\nIn this sequel to 2010\u2019s The Trip, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon go on a trip through the Italian countryside, enjoying food and joking along the way. You could easily say \"That\u2019s it,\" but the comic dynamic between the two is infectious. You can\u2019t help but laugh at them riffing off each other, and you almost wish you were along with them for the ride.\nThe one for when you\u2019re hanging with old friends: Romy and Michele\u2019s High School Reunion\nFor many of us, the high school reunion is the time to either show off or just not show up. Romy and Michele are in the same boat in this film, but concoct new identities to show off to the popular kids that tormented them in school. Of course, the dance scene to Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \"Time After Time\" makes the film. Watch this and relive the memories.\n","Title":"10 movies and TV shows to stream on Netflix this Christmas | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
