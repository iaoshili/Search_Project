It's the first update to Logic since May of last year. New are 10 additional drummers with a focus on electronic and hip hop, including one just for dubstep. Apple's also added support for Yosemite's Mail Drop and AirDrop to send projects to a nearby device.\nWOMP WOMP WOMP WAWAHAHH\nAlong with the main app, Apple also updated its two companion apps for Logic, Logic Remote and MainStage . New in Logic Remote is a way to view and manage plug-ins. You can also change the EQ with gestures, right on your iPad. On MainStage, Apple says it's expanded its sound library to more than 200 new synth patches, added a new plug-in to sample hardware synthesizers, and redesigned the look of its compressor plug-in.\nLogic and Final Cut became Apple's last remaining pro apps after the company decided to cease development on Aperture last June . Aperture was technically the newest of the three pieces of software, and unlike Final Cut and Logic, which began as acquisitions. Apple halted development on Aperture as well as iPhoto in favor of its upcoming photo editor that does many of the same things and that is integrated into OS X at a system level.\nThis latest update is free for existing users of the $199.99 app. No word on if Apple plans to update Final Cut in the near future as well.\n","Title":"Apple's latest Logic Pro X update embraces dubstep and Yosemite | The Verge","Tags":["apple","apps","tech"]}
