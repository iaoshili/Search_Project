{"Main text":"Aziz Ansari brings his newest stand-up special exclusively to Netflix\nLive at Madison Square Garden will launch Friday, March 6th\nComedian and Parks & Rec star Aziz Ansari will join forces with Netflix to release his newest comedy special, Variety reports . Aziz Ansari: Live at Madison Square Garden will be available exclusively on Netflix beginning March 6th.\nAvailable March 6th\nThis isn't the first time Ansari has teamed up with Netflix. His 2013 special Buried Alive debuted with the streaming service, but was later available as a $5 download (something Louie C.K. knows a thing or two about ). According to Variety, Live at Madison Square Garden tackles topics like gender inequality and the food industry.   The 50 Cent grapefruit joke is dead.\nNetflix's current comedy selection is pretty stacked. Right now, you can stream stand-up specials from the likes of Mike Birbiglia, Jim Gaffigan, Reggie Watts, Marc Maron, and Louie C.K., so Ansari will be in good company. He'll also be in company with himself: Buried Alive is still available on Netflix worldwide, while two of Ansari's earlier specials, Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening and Dangerously Delicious, are available in select countries.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
