{"Main text":"Here's where Disney will stream this week's Force Awakens panel \u2014 and probably exclusive new footage\nThis is the stream you're looking for\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nOver lunch, Ross Miller and I speculated about which citizen of the internet would leak exclusive footage from this week's Star Wars Celebration. Now we know the rebellious force will be none other than Disney itself. According to  StarWars.com , 30 hours of the event \u2014 including the Star Wars: The Force Awakens panel \u2014 will be live-streamed.\nFurthermore, footage exclusive to the event won't be that exclusive as it will also appear in the live stream. That means you won't have to attend Star Wars Celebration to potentially see the much rumored trailer for this year's new Star Wars film. Nor will you have to rely on some low-resolution footage filmed on the last remaining candy bar phone from 2005.\nThe live stream will feature some of the on-stage events, along with an interview on a set meant to resemble the Mos Eisley cantina. Digital festivities will begin on StarWars.com on Thursday, April 16th at 10AM PT with the Star Wars: The Force Awakens panel, which will include director J.J. Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy, and will continue through the four-day event. Looking for a recommendation? On Sunday, Gareth Edwards and Josh Trank, who are directing Rogue One and a still untitled standalone Star Wars film, respectively, will be on a panel together.\n","Title":"Here's where Disney will stream this week's Force Awakens panel \u2014 and probably exclusive new footage | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
