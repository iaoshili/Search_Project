{"Main text":"84 Comments\nWhen I think about the house I grew up in \u2014 my football-themed bedroom, the big family room, the yard \u2014 there are always Lego bricks everywhere. And I\u2019m clearly not alone, because everyone in my packed theater watching The Lego Movie this weekend seemed to have the same experience I did: a 100-minute exercise in nostalgia, rendered in RealD 3D.\nIt's the first big-budget Lego movie in the company's 80-year history, made painstakingly over five years in concert with writer\u2013director duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Its cast list is riddled with A-list actors, its marketing is massive and unavoidable \u2014 and it's a shockingly fun, remarkably entertaining movie. Sure, it's an hour and a half of advertising for Lego, but if this is the future of marketing, sign me up.\nThe movie follows Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a normal guy with a normal job and a normal life. As soon as he wakes up, he breaks out the instruction manual. Jumping jacks? Check. $37 coffee? Check. Wave to neighbors? Check. He follows the speed limit, works diligently at his construction job, and every once in a while wonders if there might be more to life than this. One night as he's leaving his worksite he meets a pretty girl named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), and finds a mysterious object called The Piece of Resistance. The one who finds it, it's been prophesied, is The Special: the smartest, most talented, most interesting person in the world, and the one who will save everyone from President Business (Will Ferrell) and his evil plan. But to do that he needs to ditch the instructions and go freestyle.\n\"Everything is Awesome,\" the movie's theme and the catchiest song you'll ever hear.\nThere's only one way to stop lord business\nIt's not exactly breaking new ground \u2014 normal guy learns he's special, saves the world \u2014 and it does come with a fair amount of heavy-handed preaching about how everyone is special and we can all be anything we want. Like any good family-friendly movie, there's a love story, there are jokes both obvious and subtle, and there's a surprisingly tender third act. But everything about the way The Lego Movie unfolds feels fresh, with Lord and Miller doing their brand-building duty while simultaneously rolling their eyes at it. Where a movie like The Internship is one long bow at the altar of Google, The Lego Movie frequently cuts to awkward scenes where minifigures can\u2019t quite figure out how to hold hands, or the revered \"relics\" that are mostly just gross things you might accidentally find in a box full of Lego bricks. It\u2019s loving throughout, but it\u2019s edgy and self-deprecating enough to never feel contrived.\nEverything in the movie from elaborate cities to puffs of smoke is made of Lego, and it's all fair game: at one point Wyldstyle builds a motorcycle out of an alleyway in order to escape Liam Neeson's nefarious Bad Cop. It's this build-and-rebuild ethos that makes the movie go \u2014 the movie twists and turns relentlessly and often without any warning, as if there's a kid above acting like King Kong and knocking down the tower he's built before starting over on something different. It's a funny, quirky, weird adventure that has fun with the limitations of Legos while making clear that there's nothing you can't do or make with those interlocking blocks. Including spaceships.\n\"I think what we\u2019ve really found is that Lego is a medium,\" Michael McNally, Lego's brand relations director, tells me. \"It\u2019s not a toy, it\u2019s a medium for other people to tell their own stories and create their own adventures.\" To tell theirs, Lord and Miller (who wrote and directed 21 Jump Street and the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series) turned to Animal Logic, a well-known Australian effects studio. The result is stunning, a mix of stop-motion and photorealism that left me constantly forgetting and remembering the characters are Lego minifigures with claws for hands and as many personalities as they have outfits.\nThe world of The Lego Movie is enormous and meticulously detailed , and McNally notes that you could pause the movie at any point and build everything you see. (Lego\u2019s own designers helped Animal Logic with the set and character design.) The film still feels very much like Lord and Miller, though, a constant string of winking references and off-topic pop culture jokes to go with crazy sight gags and physical humor. The cast may be needlessly star-studded \u2014 Channing Tatum\u2019s Superman has all of about three lines \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to imagine a lesser group pulling off this mix of irreverent and sincere. Will Arnett might be my favorite Batman ever.\nIt's a movie made for Lego fans of all ages, which McNally reminds me are everywhere: Lego is the second-largest toy maker in the world, and there are even communities of Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) around the world. \"It\u2019s no different from Volkswagen owners or Apple enthusiasts or Disney fanatics,\" he says. \"We have Lego fans.\" He grants that the movie seems designed to encourage and revive interest in Lego (and to sell bricks), but says that wasn't the point. \"A feature film was never really something we set out to make. A lot of people say, \u2018Well, toy movies are just designed to sell toys.\u2019 And that\u2019s not something that was compelling to us\u2026 it wasn\u2019t like we needed a movie to help us sell more stuff.\"\nOnly a cast this good could pull off this movie\nIt took more than two years for Warner Bros. to convince McNally and Lego to allow the movie, and more than four more to make it. \"We didn\u2019t have urgency around it,\" McNally says. \"And I think that was maybe not such a bad thing for either party, because it made us all want to work harder to make sure it was the right film.\" He says there\u2019s no immediate plan to work on a sequel, though Warner Bros. might have other ideas .\nThe Lego Movie is one of my favorite animated movies in years, and it left me wondering about that big blue bucket of interlocking squares that\u2019s still in my parents\u2019 house. Suddenly I want to build something.\n","Title":"'The Lego Movie' review: the best film about blocks you'll ever see | The Verge","Tags":["culture","movie-reviews","entertainment"]}
