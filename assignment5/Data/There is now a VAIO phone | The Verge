{"Main text":"There is now a VAIO phone\nWill VAIO make smartphones for longer than Sony?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nVAIO Corporation was formed when  Sony sold its laptop business , but now the new company is entering a product category in which Sony still remains: smartphones. The VAIO phone was announced today through Japanese MVNO B-mobile, which is pricing it to move: you\u2019ll pay ¥3,980 (about $33) a month for the hardware plus voice service and data.\nIt's nearly identical to the Panasonic Eluga U2\nThe phone itself is a mid-range affair: there\u2019s a 1.2GHz quad-core processor, a 5-inch 720p display, and a 13-megapixel camera. It\u2019s 7.95mm thick and runs Android 5.0. The phone looks a lot like a Nexus 4 , with a glass back panel and staid black front, but Japanese site  Blog of Mobile points out that it's near-identical to a Panasonic handset available in Taiwan called the Eluga U2.\nThe VAIO phone will almost certainly never make it to the US, and even in Japan, there\u2019s little to set it apart unless you have nostalgia for the brand and want to save some money over offerings from the big three carriers. But it\u2019s intriguing to note VAIO\u2019s entry into the market nonetheless, as  speculation rumbles over whether Sony\u2019s own smartphones have a future.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
