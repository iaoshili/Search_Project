{"Main text":"Tinder launches Bud Light ad campaign because bros\nSwipe right for watery misery\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nTinder this week  launched its first video ad campaign, partnering with Bud Light to promote the beer brand's \"Whatever, USA\" contest. The campaign invites users to \"swipe right\" on Bud Light's Tinder profile to enter for a chance to win a trip to the as-yet-unnamed Whatever, USA. Bud Light will select about 1,000 users to attend this year's party, which is scheduled for the last week in May. In September 2014, the company held a huge event in the town of Crested Butte, Colorado (last year's Whatever, USA) and it  sounded awful .\n\"There's a lot of synergies between the Tinder audience and the audience we're looking for,\" Hugh Cullman, Bud Light's director of marketing, tells  AdWeek .\nThis marks the first time that Tinder has created a native video ad on its platform. The company says Bud Light's ads will show up after about \"four or five\" swipes. When users swipe right in approval, a promotional video will play directly in the app, though it will only be shown to people 21 and older. They'll then be directed to a dedicated web page where they can enter the contest.\nIt also marks Tinder's latest effort to monetize. Last month, the company launched a  premium version , Tinder Plus, that offers a rewind button and,  for users of a certain age , unlimited right-swipes. Tinder has previously  partnered with Gillette to provide data on how clean-shaven men fare on the app, though it's taken a hard line on brands that try to advertise on its platform without permission. In February, the company  shut down a Gap campaign because it hadn't been authorized, as well as an  AIDS awareness campaign launched by the government of Brazil.\n","Title":"Tinder launches Bud Light ad campaign because bros | The Verge","Tags":["apps","culture","tech"]}
