Speaking at Recode's Code Media conference in Dana Point, CA, Cox told interviewer Peter Kafka that Facebook VR is on its way. \"We're working on apps for VR,\" he said. Cox didn't describe the apps in detail, but imagined a world where users will be able to share their current environment with other users using an app. He imagined that it could become an everyday way of sharing. \"You'll do it. Beyoncé will do it,\" he said. (He was using Beyoncé as a generic example of a celebrity.)\nBut don't expect them any time soon. \"A while\" is as specific as Cox would get when asked to suggest when we might be able to try Facebook in virtual reality. \"We're a long way away from everyone having those headsets,\" he said. Facebook's bet on virtual reality was evident when the company  bought Oculus VR for $2 billion last year. And as we saw at the Sundance Film Festival this year, the company is moving aggressively into building new narrative experiences using the technology,  with impressive results . But Oculus' technology appears to be headed for the core Facebook experience as well. \"Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures,\" Mark Zuckerberg  said when Facebook bought Oculus . Those experiences now appear to be on their way.\nCorrection, 1:22AM PT: Thank you to the man running Ritz Carlton's valet parking, a devoted Verge reader, who pointed out when we came to pick up our car that we had misspelled Dana Point in the initial version of this post.\n","Title":"Facebook is working on virtual reality versions of its apps | The Verge","Tags":["apps","tech"]}
