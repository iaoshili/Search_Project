{"Main text":"Pebble updates Android app with full notification support\nPlus support for characters in 80 different languages\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis week, Pebble released an update for its Android app that finally provides support to push every notification that hits your phone to your Pebble watch. Prior to this, the native Pebble app only supported a handful of notifications, including SMS, calendar, and Gmail alerts. A third-party helper app was required to get the rest, but this update obviates the need for that.\nIn addition to full notification support, the Android app has been completely rewritten for faster performance and better stability, bringing it more in line with the experience Pebble offers on iOS. Pebble says the updated app will initially be available to 10 percent of its Android users, with the rest of the rollout happening gradually over the next few weeks.\nPebble users on iOS shouldn't feel left out with this update, as Pebble is also updating the firmware on the watch to support characters in 80 different languages, eliminating the dreaded empty boxes that used to appear with accented letters. The updated firmware is available to both iOS and Android users and can be installed via the Pebble app.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
