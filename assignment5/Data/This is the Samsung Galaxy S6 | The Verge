{"Main text":"Update: Read the  Samsung Galaxy S6 review .\nOur best look yet at Samsung's next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S6, comes courtesy of T-Mobile. Late Sunday evening, CEO John Legere tweeted out news confirming that the Uncarrier will be offering Samsung's latest, but didn't provide any details beyond that. Still, the page that Legere linked to has a pretty clear shot of the S6's curved display.  AT&T also has its own version of the image, repeating the unfortunate marketing tagline and pinning the S6's release date for \"Spring 2015.\" Verizon and Sprint have yet to join in on the fun.\nFrom the front, the S6 looks a lot like the Note Edge \u2014 though this time both sides of the screen feature Samsung's unique curve. And that dark gray metal backside looks pretty nice and is a huge step above anything that Samsung's produced to this point. Goodbye, fake leather. We can't say we'll miss you.\nYou can expect to see an end to  all these teases when Samsung officially unveils the Galaxy S6 on March 1st. T-Mobile's website says there'll be much more to share on that date.\nWas there even a question? Of course @TMobile will carry The Next Big Thing! http:\/\/t.co\/st6K7weXXz\n\u2014 John Legere (@JohnLegere) February 23, 2015\nI\u2019m not just inspired by what I see, I am crafted from what I see.
