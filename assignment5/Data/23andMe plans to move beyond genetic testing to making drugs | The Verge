{"Main text":"23andMe plans to move beyond genetic testing to making drugs\nAmbitious goals, but no diseases or drug targets in sight\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGenetic testing company 23andMe wants to use the vast amounts of genetic data it has gathered over the last few years to start making drugs, according to Bloomberg . Instead of focusing on screening people for various diseases, the company plans to make therapeutic agents that will target these diseases and possibly cure them. It's a pretty big departure for the company that failed to get FDA approval for its DNA testing kit and that only just received FDA clearance to sell a test that looks for markers of Bloom Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that's associated with sun sensitivity and increased cancer risk.\n23andMe has yet to pick the diseases or drug targets that it would like to work on.  In fact, it's still deciding if it wants to strike out on its own or partner with pharmaceutical companies to run its trials.\n\"Pharma companies don\u2019t have a direct relationship with consumers.\"\nThe genetic testing company already has partnerships with pharmaceutical companies likeÂ  Pfizer Inc. and Genentech. They use the company's genetic databases to conduct research for their medicines. Thus, if 23andMe dives into the drug-making business, it will find itself competing with its partners. The company's relationships with Big Pharma won't be affected by the change, according to 23andMe President Andy Page, who spoke with Bloomberg. But CEO Anne Wojcicki says the company could make drug development more efficient.\n\"Pharma companies don\u2019t have a direct relationship with consumers, so they\u2019re always subjects,\" she said. \"By engaging them and giving it to them as a prize, saying, \u2018You\u2019ve powered this study, and you\u2019ve made this happen,\u2019 we can do things in a different way.\"\nThe former head of research and early development at Genentech, Richard Scheller, will lead 23andMe's therapeutics group. This spring, the company will try to raise money to fund the new enterprise. Since 2006, 23andMe has raised $126 million in funding.\n\"With an FDA-cleared product, we need to continue to accelerate growth,\" Wojcicki said. \"I want to push the limits.\"\n","Title":"23andMe plans to move beyond genetic testing to making drugs | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech"]}
