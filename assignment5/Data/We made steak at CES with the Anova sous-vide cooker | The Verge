{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nImmersion cooking, otherwise known as sous-vide, has exploded in popularity with the tech crowd in recent years, mostly because it makes it easy to say you're a home chef. Put your meat of choice into a plastic bag, plop it into a pot of boiling water, and you're pretty much there. (That is unless you're bad at following basic instructions.) Anova is making it easier to cook your next meaty meal by letting you very nearly forget about what's on the stove.\nSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203A\nAnova is showing off its latest sous-vide cookers and apps at CES 2015, and we got to cook steak with one right in the middle of the showroom floor. We used the Anova Precision cooker, a Bluetooth-enabled sous-vide device that pairs with the soon-to-be-released Anova app to let you select any of the company's curated recipes. All you have to do is drop your cut of meat into the water, select the recipe, and walk away. The app will announce when the meat is done.\nSelect Your Recipe and Walk Away\nAnova's product already competes with the likes of the Nomiku and the Sansaire immersion circulator, but the company wants to set their line apart by making it as dead-simple as possible.Â  The Anova Precision Cooker is currently available online for $179 . The company will also release a Wi-Fi-enabled cooker called the Anova Touch later this year that lets you leave the house entirely while your meal cooks. Just don't forget about what you're making entirely.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\n","Title":"We made steak at CES with the Anova sous-vide cooker | The Verge","Tags":["hd-home","hands--on","videos","tech","ces-2015"]}
