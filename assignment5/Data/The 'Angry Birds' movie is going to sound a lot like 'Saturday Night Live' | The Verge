{"Main text":"The 'Angry Birds' movie is going to sound a lot like 'Saturday Night Live'\nPeter Dinklage will join former 'SNL' stars Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, and Maya Rudolph\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt feels like we're well past the point of Angry Birds being a driving force in pop culture, but that isn't stopping the  questionable film based on the franchise from going ahead \u2014 in fact, it has a pretty impressive cast. The upcoming film will star Jason Sudeikis, Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph and Peter Dinklage, with Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Kate McKinnon, and Tony Hale also featuring in the movie. It's a cast full of actors with plenty of voice-acting experience among them, but there's also going to be a strong Saturday Night Live vibe here, as well \u2014 Sudeikis, Hader, and Rudolph all starred on the show and worked on it together for several years.\nWhether or not the collective talent involved will be enough to make this movie work remains to be seen, but it's definitely a strong group of actors. Angry Birds won't open until July 1st, 2016 \u2014 it'll be almost two years until we know if anyone cares about seeing these birds on the big screen.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
