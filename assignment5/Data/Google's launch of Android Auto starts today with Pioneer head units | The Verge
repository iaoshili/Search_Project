{"Main text":"Google's launch of Android Auto starts today with Pioneer head units\nJust make sure to download the app first\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle today released a dedicated Android Auto app that allows smartphones running Android 5.0 and above to communicate with compatible head units and car infotainment systems. The app passes data from Google Maps, Messages, Google Play Music, weather, and other apps from your phone to your car dashboard in a road-friendly interface that puts a big emphasis on hands-free operation.\nPioneer already has some (expensive) aftermarket head units available that can run Android Auto starting today, though the rollout of Google's software to cars has been very slow moving aside from that \u2014 despite the large list of industry partners that Mountain View has rounded up.Â  It's a pretty great in-car experience , so hopefully things start to ramp up for Android Auto before long.\nDon't expect to do much of anything with the Android Auto app if you don't have the required hardware in your car; you'll just see a lone screen with an option to disable pairing with unknown vehicles. That's it. Obviously this app exists solely as a link between phone and car \u2014 it's not meant to do much else.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
