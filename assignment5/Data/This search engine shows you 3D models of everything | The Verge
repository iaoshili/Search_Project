{"Main text":"This search engine shows you 3D models of everything\nYobi3D is designed for 3D printmakers and animators\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAre you a digital animator, 3D printmaker, or just like looking at cool rotating 3D models of things? Then  Yobi3D is for you. The search engine, which launched in June, is basically the Google of 3D object renders. Type in almost any conceivable generic object name (even some proper nouns) and you'll get a grid view of 3D models sourced from around the web. You can also rotate the models directly within the search results pages.\n\"I was really amazed with how mature web browsers have become in rendering 3D graphics,\" says Jessy Lee, the search engine's founder and CEO. Right now, Yobi3D's results can be sporadic and thin, but Lee promises that the engine will only improve as it crawls more 3D models from around the web. \"We are still developing our technology and finding more potential users,\" Lee says. Also, it has the advantage of its name starting with \"Yo,\" a syllable that's turning out to be the  defining one of the  decade .\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
