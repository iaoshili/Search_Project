{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGuillermo Del Toro  has reportedly finished writing the script for a film interpretation of DC Comics' Justice League: Dark, the comic book series that combines the talents of heroes such as Swamp Thing, Hellblazer's John Constantine, and Zatanna. According to Forbes, Del Toro's movie, tentatively titled Dark Universe, has gone to Warner Bros. for evaluation, but it's still very early in the process. Should it make it through to production and should Del Toro sign on to direct, the movie might not see release until 2018, on account of the packed schedule of the Pacific Rim director.\nIn addition to  a huge slate of standalone superhero outings, DC already has  two Justice League movies on the way, featuring Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman, and  Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman . It's not clear yet whether a Justice League: Dark film would take place in the same continuity. SlashFilm reports that Del Toro  has suggested that his movie could share the same universe as Superman and friends, but Neil Gaiman,  currently working on DC's Sandman movie , says his work will  fit into a different timeline , under DC's Vertigo imprint. The comic versions of Deadman, John Constantine, Swamp Thing, and the other heroes tapped for Dark Universe were all originally created under the same banner.\n","Title":"Guillermo Del Toro has finished the script for DC Comics' 'Justice League: Dark' movie | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
