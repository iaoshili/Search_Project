As officer Wilson is widely expected to dodge a grand jury indictment for the killing, the state has mobilized police in anticipation of unrest. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon even took the controversial step of  declaring a state of emergency in advance of the decision. The government's heavy-handed approach to controlling lawful protest appears not to have changed since St. Louis County Police donned body armor and aimed assault weapons at peaceful residents \u2014 but the rights of people in Ferguson haven't changed, either. Here's our original story in response to the troubling actions of police in Missouri immediately following Brown's death: you have a right to record the police.\nOriginal Story:\nA suburb of St. Louis, Missouri has been under a dramatic siege since Saturday, when a police officer  shot and killed an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown . In the wake of the killing, protests have engulfed the community \u2014 drawing a heavy-handed police crackdown with St. Louis County Police officers armed with assault weapons and  outfitted with military equipment . Many of the striking images have come from reporters on the front lines, but also from citizens and their smartphones.\nAround 10PM ET on Wednesday night, a St. Louis County Police line demanded that a crowd of protesters turn off their cameras. Minutes earlier, the police had ordered what appeared to be a peaceful crowd to disperse, firing smoke grenades and rubber bullets. But none of them have to turn their cameras off.\nLocal tv cameraman patched into @msnbc right now said police ordering media to shut off cameras as they advance into crowd. #Ferguson\n\u2014 Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) August 14, 2014\nNews crews a been asked to leave the #Ferguson area pic.twitter.com\/e04y1Jx91A\n\u2014 FOX2now (@FOX2now) August 14, 2014\nSt. Louis County Police should read the constitution\nHere's the deal: as a resident of the US, you have the right to record the police in the course of their public duties. The police don't have a right to stop you as long as you're not interfering with their work. They also don't have a right to confiscate your phone or camera, or delete its contents, just because you were recording them.\nDespite some state laws that make it illegal to record others without their consent, federal courts have held consistently that citizens have a First Amendment right to record the police as they perform their official duties in public. The Supreme Court also recently affirmed that the Fourth Amendment, protecting citizens from arbitrary searches and seizures, means that cops  need to \"get a warrant\" if they want to take your cellphone. (The ACLU has a concise  guide to your rights, here .) And the US Department of Justice under Obama has affirmed the court's stances by reminding police departments that  they're not allowed to harass citizens for recording them.\nSadly these rights are not always respected by the police. Even journalists are being harassed in Ferguson in the course of their reporting. Earlier this evening, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowrey and Huffington Post reporter Ryan Reilly were arrested in a McDonalds and later released with no explanation. Washington Post executive editor Martin D. Baron  said Lowrey was \"illegally instructed to stop taking video of officers,\" and then \"slammed against a soda machine and then handcuffed.\"\nOfficers decided we weren't leaving McDonalds quickly enough, shouldn't have been taping them.\n\u2014 Wesley Lowery (@WesleyLowery) August 14, 2014\nApparently, in America, in 2014, police can manhandle you, take you into custody, put you in cell & then open the door like it didn't happen\n\u2014 Wesley Lowery (@WesleyLowery) August 14, 2014\nIt's obviously bad when reporters are being arrested for no reason, but it's important to remember that all citizens \u2014 anybody who's old enough to operate a smartphone \u2014 has a right to record the official activities of police in public.\n","Title":"You have a right to record the police | The Verge","Tags":["culture","us-world\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5770102"]}
