{"Main text":"Apple raises app prices in Canada and most of Europe\nWhile prices decrease in Iceland, and 'change' in Russia\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nApple has raised the price of apps in Canada and most of Europe due to recent changes in local laws and exchange rates,  bringing the minimum app price to $1.19 Canadian dollars, .79 euro or .99 British pounds. In an email sent to developers Wednesday, and  published by Apple Insider , the company said that price increases would take effect in \"all territories in the European Union as well as in Canada and Norway, decrease in Iceland, and change in Russia.\"\nEurope added a 6.5 percent tax increase to digital goods\nThe changes were expected in Europe thanks to  newly passed legislation that increased the price of apps, ebooks, and MP3s by an average of 6.5 percent throughout most European countries. It went into effect on January 1st, though there were questions about whether the increases were going to be simply absorbed by companies or trickle down to consumers. Similar price changes were expected in Canada, where the value of its dollar has fallen well below its US counterpart, and in Russia where the ruble's value has plunged over the past 12 months .\nThese adjustments have become routine for Apple, which lets developers pick their own prices, but only from a matrix of different tiers. The company made similar changes last March , increasing prices in Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey, while trimming prices in Israel and New Zealand. It did the same thing in 2011 , mainly to readjust what had become massive disparities in app pricing between countries.\nUpdate January 9th 8:31AM ET: Updated to include current prices.\n","Title":"Apple raises app prices in Canada and most of Europe | The Verge","Tags":["apple","policy","us-world","tech"]}
