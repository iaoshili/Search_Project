{"Main text":"Ikea introduces its fastest, easiest-to-assemble furniture yet\nSwedish retailer says new line can be assembled in five minutes, without any tools\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIkea has come out with a  new line of furniture that, according to the company, can be assembled within just five minutes. The new Regissör series,  announced this week , includes a coffee table, bookshelf, and cabinets \u2014 all of which can be put together without any tools.\nThe key is a set of newly designed wooden dowels attached to the joints of each piece, replacing the annoying screws and locks that the company traditionally uses. These dowels are placed at a 45-degree angle along the wedged ends of each board, allowing for more natural support than the usual 90-degree orientation. The boards are also made of a lighter material, designed to lessen the stress on each corner.\nThe Regissör series goes on sale this month at US Ikea locations, with prices ranging from $139 for the table to $349 for the cabinet.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
