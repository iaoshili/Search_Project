{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is bringing its Cortana digital assistant to Office. The software giant is currently testing a \" Work Assistant \" app that\u2019s designed to use Cortana to open, edit, and share documents using voice commands and Cortana. Microsoft\u2019s initial app is just a prototype right now, but sources familiar with the company\u2019s plans tell The Verge that the intention is to integrate Cortana into Office across mobile and desktop platforms soon.\nCortana will make its way to iOS and Android eventually\nThat could see Cortana arrive on iOS and Android in future, or at least basic features that are powered by Microsoft\u2019s digital assistant. Given Microsoft\u2019s recent launches of Office for iOS and Android, and a continued focus on making its services and apps available across all platforms, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Cortana will eventually make the leap.  Business Insider reported in November that Microsoft\u2019s Julie Larson-Green confirmed Cortana will make its way to other operating systems, and Office integration is part of a number of plans for the digital assistant.\nA digital assistant returning to Microsoft Office will bring back memories of the annoying Clippy assistant from the '90s days of the company\u2019s productivity software. While Clippy was more of a glorified help tool that popped up randomly when you were authoring documents, Cortana is subtle and actually helpful. Microsoft has been continually improving Cortana over recent months, even  integrating it into Windows 10 and the new Spartan browser. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella often refers to Cortana as an example of the types of apps and services the company will deliver in the future.\n","Title":"Clippy comeback: Microsoft is bringing Cortana to Office | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","apps","exclusive","tech"]}
