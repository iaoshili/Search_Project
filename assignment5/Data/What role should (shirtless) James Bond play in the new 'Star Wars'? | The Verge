{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's not uncommon for big name celebrities to have unlisted cameos. Richard Branson can be seen for about  eight seconds of Casino Royale going through security. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has two cameos in Shaun of the Dead \u2014 once as himself, and again  as a zombie in a background shot. Now here's the part where we talk about Daniel Craig's rumored cameo  in Star Wars: Episode VII .\nAccording to The Sun (via  Metro and others), Craig was on the Star Wars set at Pinewood Studios last week for two days of shooting. Said the report, \"Daniel is close friends with JJ Abrams. He asked for some sort of secret cameo role \u2014 and was happy to have his name left off the posters.\"\nApparently his face won't even be seen, but we're sure it'll be obvious to anyone who sees the movie with Craig, when he laughs at a fairly innocuous moment and points up at the screen shouting, \"hey look! There I am! That's me!\" That's how we'd react, at least.\nStar Wars: Episode VII is scheduled for release December 18th, 2015. Update: And since you all have some really good ideas in the comments already \u2014 all involving Daniel Craig in various levels of nudity \u2014 keep it going!\n","Title":"What role should (shirtless) James Bond play in the new 'Star Wars'? | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment\",\"Story Streams\"","\"3691825"]}
