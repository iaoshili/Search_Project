The partnership would introduce geo-based features similar to Foursquare's venue check-ins and local recommendations, along with location-specific content. The new functions may make an appearance as early as the next quarter.\nBusiness Insider writes that an unnamed Twitter spokesperson called location a \"vehicle of discovery,\" but declined to confirm the partnership. Similarly, a Foursquare representative refused comment. Twitter appears to be keen on exploring the advantages of location-based data. It recently ran tests to examine the impact of location and has even hired David Blackman, who previously worked as Foursquare's lead geographic infrastructure engineer.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
