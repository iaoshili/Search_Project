{"Main text":"Has Lomography made the best instant camera yet?\nThe Lomo Instant is here\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nLook, I know today\u2019s digital cameras are amazing. I know you can get 50-megapixel sensors, hybrid viewfinders, and see-in-the-dark video capabilities, and I know it\u2019s easier than ever to share the stunning results. But there\u2019s one thing these cameras just don\u2019t do: produce a physical product right there on the spot.\nFor that, you need instant film. And while that used to mean digging your parents\u2019 Polaroid out of the loft, these days you can go for something newer. If you do, that\u2019ll probably mean going for something that shoots Fujifilm\u2019s Instax format. Most of the cameras that use Instax are cheap, toy-like devices, but Fujifilm itself raised the bar last year with the gorgeous Mini 90 , an instant camera that took cues from the company\u2019s premium X-series digital line. And now there\u2019s a new competitor from a formidable source.\nLomography is the first word in mainstream film photography these days. It\u2019s one of the few companies still designing and selling new film cameras at a large scale, and it has stores and fans all over the world. The prospect of a Lomography Instax camera, then, is an intriguing one, and the resulting product \u2014 the Lomo Instant \u2014 seems such an obvious hit that it\u2019s no wonder the project raised over $1 million on Kickstarter . The Lomo Instant has multiple lenses, manual controls, and Lomography\u2019s unparalleled pedigree of making film photography fun, all at a lower price than the Mini 90.\nBut the battle between the two turns out to be more complex.\nThe Lomo Instant is a big, boxy thing. With its sharp angles, protruding lens, and couple of inches\u2019 width on the Mini 90, it\u2019s not the sort of camera you can toss into a bag and forget about. But I like the design overall \u2014 it\u2019s clean and attractive, and most of the controls are tucked away in a sensible place.\nWhile the Mini 90 has a row of electronic buttons and a simple LCD display, the Lomo Instant relies entirely on physical controls. There\u2019s a manual focus lever to extend or retract the lens, switches for features like bulb mode and multiple exposure, and the shutter is a chunky slider with a satisfying click. I\u2019m not really a fan of the aperture-adjusting wheel, though \u2014 for some reason it only locks into place when the camera is switched on, and I often found myself having to reset it to avoid accidentally under- or over-exposing photos.\nYou can buy the Lomo Instant by itself for $119 or in a set with three lens converters for $149.  I\u2019d recommend splurging on the converters \u2014 the extra optical options really expand what you can do with this camera. There\u2019s a fisheye, a macro, and a 35mm-equivalent \"portrait\" lens, and all have their uses. The fisheye gives a distorted, ultra-wide view of the world or party around you rendered in a cramped circle. The macro lens doesn\u2019t get all that close and it\u2019s hard to judge precise framing and focus, but it\u2019s a useful addition for shooting food and flowers. And while 35mm isn\u2019t a classic portrait focal length, I actually prefer that adapter to the standard 27mm lens for normal use. The angle is a little tighter, so it\u2019s better for highlighting one or two subjects in the tiny Instax frame. One problem with these lens attachments is that they make the optical viewfinder less accurate; it\u2019s otherwise easier to see through than the Mini 90, but unlike Fujifilm\u2019s camera you don\u2019t get clear frame lines.\nThere are a lot of reasons to prefer the Lomo Instant over the Mini 90, then. But there\u2019s one reason to go the other way, and you might consider it kind of a big one: image quality. In my experience, Fujifilm\u2019s camera simply takes better photos most of the time.\nNo one buys Lomography cameras for DSLR-rivalling photos\nNow, \"better\" is a loaded term. No one buys Lomography cameras for sharp and accurate photos to rival a DSLR; the quirks and flaws are part of the appeal. And the Lomo Instant isn\u2019t necessarily any different, especially if you experiment with some its more esoteric features. But ultimately, the Mini 90 is better at handling exposure, particularly in low light. Often the Lomo Instant\u2019s flash will blow out all detail in the subject\u2019s face while obscuring the background in shadow, while the Mini 90\u2019s auto modes do a great job of rendering both at the same time. It\u2019s possible to mitigate this \u2014 try dialing the aperture down a notch while using the flash on your subject in combination with a long exposure for the surroundings \u2014 but it\u2019s not intuitive. You always have to think about what you\u2019re doing with the Lomo Instant.\nOr do you? Given the not inconsiderable cost of instant film, the point-and-shoot reliability of the Mini 90 will be a major advantage for many. But if you\u2019re into the impulsive, reckless philosophy of Lomography , you might find the Lomo Instant more to your liking. If all you want out of an instant camera is a bunch of quirky mementos that were fun to shoot, you\u2019ll be happy here. It\u2019s not like it takes worse photos than a Diana , and the film is certainly more convenient to \"develop.\"\nI get what Lomography was going for with the Lomo Instant, and I think a lot of people will like it. It\u2019s a blast to use, and it sets itself apart from every other modern instant camera with its hands-on control and extra lenses.\nBut when I was using it, I couldn\u2019t help thinking of my favorite Lomography camera, which is also one of my favorite cameras ever: the iconic LC-A+, whose forerunner birthed the entire Lomography company. That camera has an amazing, simple, and reliable automatic exposure system: you just hold the shutter down until it clicks a second time once the exact amount of light for a perfect exposure has been captured. It gives unique and beautiful results with minimal effort while allowing for extra creative control if you need it.\nThe Lomo Instant is creatively satisfying, but demands some work\nThat feels like it would have been the right approach for an instant camera, where the number of photos you take is likely to be even more limited than with 35mm film. It\u2019s almost the approach taken by Fujifilm with the Mini 90, although that camera\u2019s heavy reliance on automatic exposure and the realities of Instax film mean that it takes much less dramatic photos than an LC-A+. The Lomo Instant, meanwhile, demands you to put some work in for conventionally great shots, lest its powerful flash blow out your memories.\nLomography fans and anyone else used to shooting film in 2015 will probably relish the challenge and rewards \u2014 the Lomo Instant is hands-on and creatively satisfying. But if you\u2019re expecting digital-level reliability, you\u2019ll be better off with Fujifilm\u2019s Mini 90. Whichever way you go, I\u2019m just glad that instant film\u2019s surprising revival is enough of a thing today to support different kinds of shooters.\n","Title":"Has Lomography made the best instant camera yet? | The Verge","Tags":["photography","report","tech"]}
