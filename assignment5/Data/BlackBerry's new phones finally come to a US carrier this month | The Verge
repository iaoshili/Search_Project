But if you've been looking to buy one from a US carrier, your choices have been non-existent, at least until now. BlackBerry has announced that  AT&T will be selling both the Passport and the Classic starting on February 20th. The Passport will run $649.99 or $199.99 with a new contract, while the Classic will sell for $419.99 or $49.99 on contract. Both phones will be available through AT&T's Next financing plan.\nAT&T's version of the Passport is a little different than the model sold globally: it has rounded corners instead of sharp edges. Otherwise, it's the same phone, complete with a 4.5-inch square display and three-row physical keyboard. AT&T's Classic is the same model as available elsewhere.\nAT&T's Passport has rounded corners instead of sharp edges\nThe Passport will be a US exclusive to AT&T, though you can still purchase the phone direct from BlackBerry or Amazon. Other carriers, such as Verizon, have committed to selling the Classic, though they have not yet announced availability. BlackBerry is expected to announce more of its device roadmap plans at the upcoming Mobile World Congress trade show in a few weeks.\nYou can see AT&T's version of the Passport in more detail in the promotional video released by the carrier below:\n","Title":"BlackBerry's new phones finally come to a US carrier this month | The Verge","Tags":["blackberry","mobile","tech"]}
