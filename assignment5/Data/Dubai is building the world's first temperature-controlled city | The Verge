The ambitious project is expected to feature a mall, an indoor family theme park, and a \"network of temperature-controlled openable promenades\" \u2014 all billed as \"the world's largest.\" According to developer Dubai Holding, the 7 kilometer (4.35 mile) expanse of covered walkways will allow weeklong stays without the need for cars or exposure to Dubai's harsh desert climate, which averages 104 degrees Farenheit in the summer.\nThe Mall of the World\nThe Mall of the World will also include a 3-million-square-foot wellness district and theaters modeled after famous cultural landmarks like the West End and Broadway. There will be 100 hotels and service apartments built on the 48-million-square-foot premises in order to accommodate the 180 million visitors the mall hopes to host annually. \"The objective is to create an integrated city with a plethora of best-in-class options within pleasant environments,\" said United Arab Emirates Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in a statement .\nNeither a budget nor a completion date have been announced as of yet. The Mall of the World might seem like an outlandish, capitalistic fantasy, but Dubai is no stranger to extravagance. Among other things, the city is famous for containing the  world's tallest building and throwing  a record-breaking fireworks display.\n","Title":"Dubai is building the world's first temperature-controlled city | The Verge","Tags":["us-world","tech"]}
