{"Main text":"Motorola is going to hand-deliver us a weird mystery box on February 25th\nWhat could it be?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMotorola sent out emails to the press this morning teasing an \"exciting announcement\" that will take place on February 25th, once a box is hand-delivered to members of the press that morning. No indication has been given as to what may be in the box, but it seems too soon for another Moto X. This may be the first major product (if it is a product and not just another game that pops up inconveniently on the Moto X) from Motorola since it was  acquired by Lenovo back in October. It could be an updated Moto 360 or Moto E, or something new altogether (VR?), but the only indication Motorola has given so far is \"everything you need fits inside one box.\"\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
