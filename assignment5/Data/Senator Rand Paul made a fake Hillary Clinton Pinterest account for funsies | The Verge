{"Main text":"Senator Rand Paul made a fake Hillary Clinton Pinterest account for funsies\nHe's just a cyberbully teen at heart\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYesterday, when  2016 presidential hopeful Rand Paul could've been doing literally anything else, he decided to do something weird and embarrassing instead.\nHillary Clinton's new Valentine's Day Pinterest board is worth a look. Check it out and please RT! https:\/\/t.co\/UCOodbX9gh\n\u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 14, 2015\nThe senator (or, more likely, some poor disillusioned member of his team) created a fake Hillary Clinton Pinterest account for Valentine's Day. It's not worth looking at, so I'll tell you about it.\nThe account features a \"White House Remodel\" board (cause women love interior decorating!!), a \"Shoulda Woulda Coulda\" board full of Democrats and spelling errors (direct quote: \"#bffes who almost got there. Pined for reflection.\"), and a \"Power Couple\" board featuring unflattering photos of Hillary and Bill (he's her capital B Bae). Not only is it a poorly done parody, it's not even a good use of Pinterest or internet slang. But there is this Valentine:\nSo. There's that.\nThis is kind of like the time John Boehner's staff used  Taylor Swift GIFs to attack Obama , but with an even more amorphous political position and worse graphics. Hey politicians, we know the teens don't care about you, but this? Your dated, bumbling application of trends and media to political attacks? It's not working.\n","Title":"Senator Rand Paul made a fake Hillary Clinton Pinterest account for funsies | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","tldr","us-world","entertainment"]}
