{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nT-Mobile made headlines when it  announced rollover data as the latest of its Uncarrier initiatives, letting customers carry over the unused data they've already paid for into subsequent billing cycles. Not long after, T-Mobile's much larger rival AT&T followed with  a slightly different take on the concept . But the trend won't be continuing on to Verizon Wireless, the largest mobile provider in the United States.  CNET reports that CFO Fran Shammo emphatically shut down the idea during an interview Thursday, explaining that it simply doesn't make much financial sense from where Verizon stands now. \"We're a leader, not a follower,\" Shammo said.\n\"We are just not going to compete with that.\"\n\"We did not go to places where we did not financially want to go to save a customer,\" Shammo said. Nor does Verizon seem overly worried about the prospect of customers switching to T-Mobile for Data Stash and other Uncarrier perks. If basement-level pricing is what you're after, the company has no problems watching you leave. \"There's going to be certain customers who leave us for price, and we are just not going to compete with that because it doesn't make financial sense for us to do that.\"\nVerizon's not really mincing words here; it's in a cushy position and making heaps of money, so executives are flat out ignoring John Legere's attempts to change the entire mobile industry. If T-Mobile's strong growth keeps up (and Verizon notices an exodus), the story might change. But for now, you'd better make the most of that data you're paying for. It's only good for a month \u2014 and staying that way. Hey, at least us grandfathered unlimited customers are  still living the good life .\n","Title":"Verizon won't do rollover data and doesn't care if you leave for T-Mobile | The Verge","Tags":["mobile","tech"]}
