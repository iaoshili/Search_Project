{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nWhat else is Tesla unveiling at i ts event in Los Angeles next week ? Founder Elon Musk said to expect the \"D,\" which is likely the company's  dual-motor, all-wheel-drive model of the Model S. But he also teased \"something else.\" Now Bloomberg says that one more thing is a control system for the Model S that keeps the car in its lane on freeways. Tesla is also said to be showing off other features that will help the car drive itself.\n90 percent autopilot is nearly here\nThe move would represent one of Tesla's first forays into self-driving cars. Musk has already said that the company is at work on numerous technologies to help cars drive without help from humans, but that there's still 5 to 6 years of work to do before they'll be ready for consumer vehicles. The holdup, he said in an interview last month, was getting the computer vision technology faster and more capable at recognizing objects and making decisions.\nThat doesn't mean Tesla won't try out a few things though. In  an interview with CNNMoney yesterday, Musk teased \"autopilot\" cars as being months away. \"A Tesla car next year will probably be 90 percent capable of autopilot. Like, so 90 percent of your miles can be on auto. For sure highway travel,\" Musk said.\nOne hint that this may be ready sooner than later is the fact that Tesla's been installing cameras on the front of its Model S for the past month so that they can be sold in Europe.\n","Title":"Tesla might unveil its first self-driving features next week | The Verge","Tags":["tech","transportation"]}
