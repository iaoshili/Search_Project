{"Main text":"This Ghostface Killah video reimagines a 1970s noir with aliens and ray guns\nThe Wu Tang member's collaboration with BadBadNotGood drops February 17th\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nNext month, thick-tongued Wu Tang member Ghostface Killah and Toronto alt-funk trio BadBadNotGood will release their collaborative LP, Sour Soul. It's an unlikely pairing, but the tracks they've released so far \u2014 like the crunchy boom-bap single \" Gunshowers \" \u2014 show an exciting inclination for future-swiped '70s funk. They take that inclination even further in the above video for the MF Doom-featuring \"Ray Gun,\" which recruits Odd Future rapper Left Brain as its star.\nNeon-lit strip clubs, low-riders, and tarot cards\nThe clip, directed by Rob Schroeder of Lodger Films , is set in a retro-noir city, complete with neon-lit strip clubs, low-riders, tarot cards, gold teeth as currency, and dead-eyed damsels. Left Brain, wearing a mask that looks like a more robotic, less skeletal version MF Doom's, plays \"The Mask,\" a stoic extra-terrestrial with a ray gun and a hero complex.\nMF Doom and Ghostface are longtime collaborators and have been teasing a joint project, DoomStarks, for nearly five years now.  During a Reddit AMA last year, Ghostface said that album would be here in 2015. Until then, \"Ray Gun\" is a good reminder that Doom's double-time rhymes are a great foil to Ghostface's staccato flow.\nA note to Ariana Grande: this is how you do  classic sci-fi exploitation . Sour Soul is due out February 17th on Lex Records.\n","Title":"This Ghostface Killah video reimagines a 1970s noir with aliens and ray guns | The Verge","Tags":["culture","watch-this","entertainment","music"]}
