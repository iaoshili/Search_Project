TMZ first reported the news, noting that the cause of death was likely a drug overdose. The comedian had a long history with addiction and had spoken openly about his experiences in rehab.\nWittels was a fixture of the Los Angeles comedy scene, where he was  often a guest on the Comedy Bang Bang podcast. He had a regular segment, Harris\u2019 Phone Corner, where he read aloud jokes \u2014 mostly terrible ones \u2014 that he texted to himself. (\"Just call half-and-half: one.'\" \"Wi-Fi? \"Because-Fi.\") He was also in a comedic pop band,  Don\u2019t Stop or We\u2019ll Die , with fellow comedians Paul Rust and Michael Cassady.\nIn November 2010, Wittels created  \"humblebrag,\" a Twitter account devoted to a phenomenon he had noticed on social media: people making what at first sounded like self-deprecating remarks, which in fact functioned as boasts. This one, from Pixar director Lee Unkrich, is a representative example:\nSpaz Alert: I tripped walking up stairs to stage to receive my Oscar Nominee certificate. #foreveranerd\n\u2014 Lee Unkrich (@leeunkrich) February 8, 2011\nWittels retweeted the humblebrags he found onto the Twitter account, and also began collecting them into  a series of columns for Grantland .
