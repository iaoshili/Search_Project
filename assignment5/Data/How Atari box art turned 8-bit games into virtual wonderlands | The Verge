{"Main text":"65 Comments\nThe cover for Adventure on the Atari looks nothing like the title it\u2019s promoting. The game itself is essentially made of a series of rectangles, with a few blocky enemies prowling around, while the main adventurer is simply a square. You\u2019re forced to imagine the fantasy world you\u2019re meant to be exploring. But imagining it is a whole lot easier thanks to the vibrant artwork of Susan Jaekel. Because of her painting on the cover of the box, you knew that you were actually venturing through a hedge maze with three huge dragons lurking inside. It filled in the gaps left by the game\u2019s rudimentary graphics \u2014 and Adventure was far from alone.\nThe original Atari featured a wealth of games with box art that was quite a bit more imaginative than the \u201Cgrizzled man holding a gun\u201D template that\u2019s so popular today. The concept of playing a video game in your house, on your television, was still in its infancy in the late 1970s, and Atari needed a way to market its games. One solution was to commission intricately detailed covers that sold the idea of a game much better than any simple screenshot could. \u201CThe game-playing experience wasn\u2019t 100 percent of the experience,\u201D says Tim Lapetino, an artist and designer currently working on a book about the history of Atari cover art. \u201CPart of what made the world complete was the artwork that conjured up this other place. I wasn\u2019t sitting in my living room anymore; I was on this desolate planet or in space. And it was mostly because of that art.\u201D\nHover for full-color art.\n\"My covers kind of fired up that imagination.\"\nFirst released in 1977, the Atari 2600 \u2014 or Atari VCS, as it was originally known \u2014 wasn\u2019t the first home video game console. But it did help usher in a novel concept: having games stored on cartridges that you could swap in and out of the machine. These games were sold individually in stores, and the boxes lining retail shelves had to do a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of promotion. One of the earliest games to hit the Atari 2600 was Combat, which was not only part of the first wave of launch titles, but came packaged with the console for several years. It was also the first cover painted by Cliff Spohn, an artist who helped define the look of Atari box art early on. \u201CI kind of approached them like a paperback book cover or a poster for some sporting event,\u201D says Spohn.\nSteeplechase 1975\nSuper Breakout 1978\nHis goal was to show players what screenshots couldn\u2019t. \u201CThe little icons on the screen were so abstract,\u201D he says, \u201Cso the kids that were playing it would be picturing submarines and battleships and airplanes and all of that kind of stuff. So my covers kind of fired up that imagination.\u201D Spohn\u2019s art dominated the early covers, but as Atari grew, so did its roster of artists. Soon he was joined by a crew with a diverse range of backgrounds. Adventure artist Jaekel, for instance, had experience in textbook illustration, while Rick Guidice had worked on space-colony concept art for NASA in the 1970s. Even George Opperman, the late graphic artist who created the enduring Atari logo, chipped in a few covers.\nFor some impressionable youths, the art even helped shape their lives. Lapetino, for one, credits those early covers with getting him into the field of graphic design . \u201CI didn\u2019t know there was such thing as design or illustration,\u201D he says. \u201CBut I liked it, and it really appealed to me, and I think this idea of image making really got me thinking about art, and eventually design, as a career.\u201D The quality of the art and the imagination it required is perhaps even more impressive considering few of the artists actually played the games their work was based on. \u201CI never played the games, I was totally clueless about that,\u201D says Jaekel. Likewise, fellow artist John Enright had never played a video game at all prior to taking on the assignment, and says that \u201Cto this day I have never played a single Atari game.\u201D\nInstead, the artists would get a basic outline from an art director at Atari on what the game was about and what concepts the cover needed to get across. Some artists, like Steve Hendricks, would actually interview the programmers and designers working on the games to get a better feel for what they were about. But Atari also gave them a good amount of freedom to do what they wanted, which could be one of the reasons the company ended up with such a fantastic collection of box art for its console. \u201CIt was really nice to work with them because they were pretty open about what it was that I could do,\u201D says Jaekel. \u201CAs I recall, I don\u2019t know that they really gave me much direction. They just would tell me what the game was about, sort of loosely, and it was up to me to come up with a concept.\u201D\nToday, covers for big games largely follow a familiar template, and trailers and screenshots can do the job that was once in box art\u2019s domain. There\u2019s now a formula that appears to work with consumers, something that didn\u2019t exist when Atari was starting out. \u201CThey really spent a lot of money, and they spent a lot of time, working hard to create individual identities to help sell these games,\u201D says Lapetino, \u201Cso that each game had a different feel based on totally custom artwork.\u201D\nHaunted House\nIn Haunted House players explored a spooky mansion, and the cover features several bats and a spider, with a pair of worried-looking eyes lurking in the background. Those eyes weren\u2019t just thematically appropriate, though \u2014 they were also relevant to the game itself. Haunted House took place from a top-down perspective, with the player represented by a pair of eyes. Earlier versions (pictured above) featured a similar design, but with eyes overlaid on top of a woman running from danger. This accidentally risqu√© placement meant that artist Steve Hendricks was forced to go a different route, resulting in one of the console\u2019s most memorable covers. \u201CI\u2019ve been told that these covers really did capture the imaginations of young gamers at the time,\u201D says Hendricks. \u201CIt gave them a tangible visual of the game that could add value to the gameplay. It brought the game to life.\u201D\nDefender\nDefender is an example of a cover that looks a lot more exciting than the actual gameplay. While the game itself was a side-scrolling shooter where you fought off waves of pixels purported to be alien invaders, the cover featured a sleek-looking spaceship firing lasers at an unsuspecting populace. According to artist Steve Hendricks, he took on the job despite not being very familiar with Atari or gaming. \u201CWe approached each new cover as if it were a paperback book cover,\u201D he says. \u201CThe illustration needed to capture the imagination of potential gamers since the game graphics themselves were so primitive at the time.\u201D\nWarlords\nWarlords was a huge arcade success in the early 1980s, and its Atari port was equally loved. Steve Hendricks\u2019 cover for the home version featured a sword-swinging knight, with an epic battle reflected on his armor. The knight\u2019s look was based on Jim Heather, designer and programmer on the game. While Hendricks was one of Atari\u2019s more prolific cover artists, he says that he only worked on projects like Warlords because he personally found them interesting. \u201CI would get a list of all the new game titles from [design manager John Hyashi],\u201D he says, \u201Cand then I would divide up the illustrations among our internal staff of illustrators and many freelance illustrators. So I would work on the titles I thought would be fun to work on.\u201D\nNight Driver\nNight Driver is perhaps best known for being one of the earliest racing games to feature a first-person perspective. The cover art for the Atari version has a different perspective, though, showing a road filled with high-speed racers driving as the sun sets in the background \u2014 the game does take place at night, after all. For the driver, artist Steve Hendricks used the likeness of fellow Atari illustrator Jim Kelly, whose face also served as the inspiration for the cover of Othello, an Atari game released in 1980. \u201CHe was a great model and illustrator,\u201D says Hendricks.\nFlag Capture\nUbisoft may be delving into the world of pirates with the next edition of Assassin\u2019s Creed, but Atari was doing it long before with the release of Flag Capture. This strategy game had players attempting to locate a flag hidden in a grid of boxes, and it\u2019s a great example of just how primitive video game visuals were three decades ago. The cover art, in contrast, is a lush swashbuckling painting created by John Enright, who felt particularly drawn to the subject matter. \u201CI have always had a fascination for pirates, so this was a no-brainer,\u201D he says. \u201CI remember being completely energized during each painting session, which would last approximately six hours between breaks, 12-15 hours each day until it was completed, packaged, and delivered in person to their corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley.\u201D\nSlot Racers\nThe cover art for Slot Racers depicts a particularly 1980s vision of the future \u2014 big, sleek cars on winding roads in a neon light-filled city. It wouldn\u2019t look out of place in a movie like Tron. The game, meanwhile, consisted of a series of increasingly complex mazes in which two players track each other down while driving missile equipped vehicles. The piece was created based entirely on feedback from one of Atari\u2019s art directors. \u201CAs illustrator, I took careful notes and sketches as well as reference materials to refine the final composition,\u201D says artist John Enright.\nVanguard\nOriginally released as an arcade game by Japanese developer Tose, Vanguard was later ported by Atari to both the 2600 and 5200. It was one of the first scrolling space-shooters ever made, but aside from its achievements as a game, it\u2019s also notable for its cover. If the sci-fi style looks familiar, it should \u2014 the Atari version of Vanguard featured a cover painted by none other than the late Ralph McQuarrie, a concept artist who helped define the look of the original Star Wars trilogy. He also worked on iconic films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Total Recall, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but in between those gigs he managed to craft one of the Atari\u2019s most enduring covers.\nAdventure\nAdventure is one of the Atari 2600\u2019s most iconic games, so it\u2019s only natural that its cover would be fondly remembered as well. While much of the cover art for Atari games had a dark and serious feel, Susan Jaekel\u2019s painting for Adventure differed in its upbeat style and bright colors. Her background may have been in textbook illustration, but the subject matter for games proved to be much more creatively fulfilling \u2014 and it\u2019s something players still remember today. \u201CI\u2019ve had several emails and phone calls over the years,\u201D says Jaekel, \u201Cand it\u2019s usually people who played [Adventure], and I don\u2019t know if it was just a happy time in their childhood or what. Artwork always adds so much to anything, whether it\u2019s a book cover or a game cover.\u201D\nBasic Math\nGiven her experience with children\u2019s books and textbooks, it seems only natural that Susan Jaekel would work a on project like Basic Math. In contrast to the educational game\u2019s straightforward arithmetic-based gameplay, the cover is vivid, colorful, and full of wonder. While the subject matter was similar, creating artwork for a math game was much different than doing the same for a math book. \u201CWith the textbook illustrations, you\u2019re given a real specific assignment,\u201D says Jaekel. And not only that, but the actual pieces were tiny, since they had to fit on the pages of the book. That wasn\u2019t the case here. \u201CTo do these, they were so much larger, with exciting subject matter, and it was really fun.\u201D\n3D Tic-Tac-Toe\nThere\u2019s perhaps no more exciting image of tictactoe than the cover for Atari\u2019s 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, which depicts a robot playing against a woman and dog wearing spacesuits. And unlike many of the Atari covers that graced store shelves, 3D Tic-Tac-Toe was a collaboration between multiple artists. \u201CI collaborated with Rick Guidice with that one,\u201D explains Susan Jaekel, \u201Cbecause he was so good at structures, so he helped me with those four grids that are going across.\u201D Their aim with the beautiful sci-fi illustrations was simply to make the game seem exciting to shoppers browsing the rows of game boxes in store \u2014 and nothing says fun like a dog with a space helmet.\nBasic Programming\nFor Basic Programming artist Rick Guidice had a particularly challenging task: to make learning to program seem exciting. To do so, he created a cover featuring two men working at huge consoles full of blinking lights. It makes programming look as intense and awesome as operating a spaceship. Those sci-fi influences shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, though, as Guidice had spent time in the 1970s creating concept paintings for NASA, providing the world a glimpse of what the space colonies of the future might look like.\nAir-Sea Battle\nAir-Sea Battle was one of the earliest Atari games, launching alongside the console in 1977. The gameplay covered all manner of warfare: you could shoot down planes with an anti-aircraft gun, pilot a submarine to down warships with torpedoes, and bomb ships while soaring through the skies. The game\u2019s cover captured all of this with an epic battle featuring ships, planes, submarines, and plenty of dangerous projectiles. Fitting all of that onto one box wasn\u2019t easy. \u201CHow am I going to get submarines, ships, planes, bombs, and get them all together? It\u2019s like building a puzzle,\u201D says artist Cliff Spohn.\nStar Ship\nLike any good sci-fi classic, the cover of Star Ship features an epic space battle with lots of cool ships and large-scale explosions. That\u2019s in stark contrast to the game itself, which was little more than a black screen and colored blocks. The sci-fi illustration not only caught the eye of gamers, but artists as well. \u201CCliff Spohn did some amazing illustrations for Atari,\u201D says fellow artist John Enright. \u201CThis artist has a remarkable talent for color and elegant composition. His style is so fluid and relaxed.\u201D\nSurround\nSurround was another of the original Atari launch titles, and it\u2019s notable for being the precursor to the Nokia gaming favorite Snake. It was essentially a clone of the arcade game Blockade: two players would take control of tiny blocks, trying to stay clear of each other for as long as possible, while leaving a Tron lightcycle-like trail that had to be avoided. The cover, meanwhile, depicted those two players as a pair sitting in front of a huge bank of computer consoles, complete with Atari-style joysticks. \u201CWith Surround, I wanted to create a very futuristic, very dimensional look, because it was a very flat game,\u201D says Cliff Spohn.\nSuper Breakout\nThe concept of Breakout and its sequel is incredibly abstract: you control a paddle and you need to bounce a ball to clear out bricks at the top of the screen. But the cover for Super Breakout made it feel a bit more real. You weren\u2019t just a paddle, you were an astronaut gripping a paddle. And it was the small details that really made Cliff Spohn\u2019s cover stand out. \u201CThe thing I loved about that,\u201D says Lapetino, \u201Cwas the idea that this rainbow-bricked wall in Breakout was an actual thing, because you could see it reflected on the helmet of the astronaut.\u201D\nMissile Command\nOriginally released in the arcades in 1980, Missile Command was ported to Atari\u2019s home console soon after. Its cover was created by the late George Opperman, who was not only responsible for the graphic design featured on many of Atari\u2019s arcade cabinets and pinball machines, but also created the company\u2019s iconic logo. For Missile Command, he created a complex scene with firing rockets and huge computer terminals. \u201CI love Missile Command,\u201D says Lapetino. \u201CI love to stare at it because that game is so different than what the box art was like, and it was just amazing to look at this really complicated scene.\u201D\nE.T.\nE.T.: The Extraterrestrial is the Atari\u2019s most infamous game: it was so bad and sold so poorly that rumors persist that truckloads of unsold copies are buried somewhere in New Mexico. Someone is even making a documentary about it. But as notoriously bad as the game is, the cover is actually quite wonderful, capturing the feeling of the film in a way the game failed to do. It was the handiwork of Japanese artist Hiro Kimura, whose work has been featured by everyone from Coca-Cola and General Electric to the NFL and The New Yorker.\nPhotography by Michael Shane, sketches courtesy of Steve Hendricks\n","Title":"How Atari box art turned 8-bit games into virtual wonderlands | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","features","design"]}
