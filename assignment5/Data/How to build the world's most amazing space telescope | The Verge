Scientists and engineers are hard at work on a larger, more powerful successor \u2014 the James Webb Space Telescope . Hubble has had an impressive run \u2014 it\u2019s been used to detect clouds on distant planets, find evidence of planets with glass rain, and image a star near the end of its life \u2014 but the Webb will be able to do more. The researchers behind Webb hope to probe the early universe by gathering some of the earliest, most distant light. And engineers building the telescope have recently completed a major milestone: finishing and delivering the mirrors that will be pieced together for Webb\u2019s huge primary mirror.\nThat mirror will be a stunning a 21 feet high, made of 18 smaller hexagonal mirrors. It\u2019ll be used to help the telescope capture images of the night sky and also break down the spectrum of the incoming light to analyze properties of galaxies, stars, and even exoplanet atmospheres. The Webb venture isn\u2019t just an American endeavor, but is part of an international collaboration that includes NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency.\nA telescope to probe the early universe\nThe lead scientist on the project, Nobel laureate John Mather, says that agencies wanted a new telescope because \"[researchers] believed when they built [Hubble], when they designed it, that it would be able to see the first galaxies forming in the early universe. They found a big surprise \u2014 they couldn\u2019t.\" The reason being that the oldest light in the universe has undergone a doppler shift \u2014 much like the pitch of a car horn shifts as it passes you, light shifts due to the expansion of the universe. The Hubble telescope can detect the same colors the human eye can detect and a little beyond, but it can\u2019t detect this stretched-out, infrared light from the early universe.\nIndeed, detecting infrared light poses some daunting challenges. A telescope like Hubble generates its own heat and is exposed to the rays of the sun, both sources of of infrared light. These factors could drown out the weak infrared signals from far-away galaxies. To keep cool, the Webb will orbit a million miles from Earth \u2014 four times further than the moon. At its orbital point, the Earth, moon, and sun will all be in the same direction, so they can all be shaded with one sunshade.\nEach of the mirrors take a large amount of effort to construct, and it took years to actually make them. The Webb has to be very cold to operate, but materials can warp with temperature change. The researchers selected the metallic element beryllium because it will warp very little with falling temperatures. Even still, the process of constructing the mirrors required much care and many iterations: after polishing the mirrors at room temperatures, engineers cool it down to see how it warps, and then try another polish to compensate for this warping.\nThe final versions of those mirrors have recently been delivered to the Goddard Space Flight Center. But despite that major milestone, Webb won\u2019t be ready for liftoff until 2018. There is still testing needed for the telescope\u2019s existing components, and construction for the rest of the parts that will comprise the observatory and the rockets, among other elements.\nOnce in space, Webb will probe the first stars and galaxies, the birth of stars, and Earth-like planets. Scientists are looking for plenty of things, but Mather himself hopes to peer toward the unknown. \"The real hope is we\u2019ll get some big surprises,\" he said. And by looking where no other telescope can see, Webb has a good chance of surprising us.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nAfter arriving at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Webb\u2019s mirrors are inspected. The containers are hermetically sealed to protect against pressure changes that occur in transit.\nWebb\u2019s mirrors are inspected in a cleanroom at Goddard Space Flight Center.

The model was brought to the South by Southwest festival in March.\nThe sunshield membrane is necessary to allow the telescope to operate at very low temperatures. Here it is being inspected at Northrop Grumman to ensure it is up to spec.\nTo test components of the telescope, scientists put them in a very cold vacuum chamber.
