{"Main text":"Google bringing always-on voice commands to Chromebooks\n'OK Google' feature now available on Chrome OS Dev Channel\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nYou've been able to yell voice commands at Android smartphones and Android Wear smartwatches for some time now, but soon you'll be able to do the same to a Chromebook computer. A new feature available to Chromebooks running early release software lets users say \"Ok Google\" to activate voice commands and searches on the laptop, just like on many Android smartphones. Voice commands can be used to perform web searches, get itineraries, check the weather, and more. The Chromebook will always listen for the voice command so long as the screen is on and the display is unlocked.\nThe feature was first described by  Google employee François Beaufort on Google+ . It is currently only available on the Chrome Dev channel, and users need to enable a special flag in Chrome OS' settings menu to access it. Beaufort did not say when it would become more widely available on the stable Chrome OS releases, but it doesn't usually take long for features to trickle down from the developer builds to the rest of the Chromebook world.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
