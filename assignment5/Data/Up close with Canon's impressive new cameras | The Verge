{"Main text":"Up close with Canon's impressive new cameras\nThe 50-megapixel EOS 5DS and diminutive EOS M3 make their debut\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nCanon announced a lot of new cameras today, but two in particular stand out \u2014 the 50-megapixel EOS 5DS is now the highest-resolution full-frame DSLR in the world, and the EOS M3 represents the camera giant\u2019s most serious take yet on the mirrorless category. While the camera industry is going through a period of transition, Canon remains a dominant force; it sells more high-end cameras than anyone. I went along to the Tokyo launch event to see how its latest are shaping up.\nThe EOS M3 is easily Canon\u2019s most usable mirrorless camera to date. The company managed to fit most of the controls you\u2019d want onto the palm-sized body, including two control rings and a separate exposure compensation dial, and the new ergonomic grip makes the camera far more comfortable to hold than its predecessors without adding too much bulk. The biggest criticism of the original EOS M (and its successor, which never left Japan) was the way it eschewed physical controls for fiddly touchscreen operation. The touchscreen remains on the M3, in newly flexible form, but it\u2019ll be a lot easier to ignore than on previous models.\nAutofocus performance seems much improved, too, though it\u2019s hard to say for sure without testing in various lighting conditions. The 24-megapixel APS-C sensor uses the latest iteration of Canon\u2019s on-chip phase detection AF technology as well as giving a bump in resolution.\nThere\u2019s no space for a viewfinder in the EOS M3\u2019s diminutive frame, but the camera is compatible with the EVF-DC1 accessory that launched with last year\u2019s G1 X Mark II. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not as good an experience as the built-in units on even mid-range models from Fujifilm or Olympus; the LCD isn\u2019t as vibrant, with lower magnification than you\u2019d hope for, and it just doesn\u2019t feel as natural holding your eye up to a bulbous accessory sticking out of the top of a camera. The option is there if you need it, but if you\u2019re the type of shooter that prefers a viewfinder, this probably isn\u2019t the camera for you.\nThe EOS M3's biggest roadblock might be Canon itself\nOverall, though, the EOS M3 is an impressive body that should, on paper, be very competitive with others on the market. But the biggest roadblock might be Canon itself. As you\u2019ll see in a photo below, the EOS M line still only has four lenses available, three of which are slow zooms. You can use an adapter to mount EF DSLR lenses, but then you\u2019re missing out on the size and weight advantages of mirrorless in the first place. And it appears that Canon is opting against releasing the EOS M3 in North America, instead restricting it to Asia and Europe. I think Canon\u2019s proven that it knows how to make a good mirrorless camera; all the company needs to do now is give it the push it needs.\nThe EOS 5DS, on the other hand, looks like a straightforward hit. Building on the success of its 5D line, the 5DS uses a record-breaking new 50-megapixel sensor that gives more resolution than any full-frame DSLR ever made. With this camera, Canon is targeting studio and landscape photographers who might be tempted to make the leap to medium format. But the 5DS\u2019 body is near-identical to the current 5D Mark III, making for a much more portable package than something like a Pentax 645z.\nThe megapixel wars have ignited once again\nThat\u2019s the problem with trying to tell you anything about the 5DS at this stage, though \u2014 upon using it at Canon\u2019s event for a while, my first impressions were \"well, this sure does feel like a 5D.\" That is by no means a bad thing, but the real test for this camera will be how it performs under actual professional use. Given the 5DS' smaller pixels, it\u2019s likely that the 5D Mark III will offer better low-light performance, for instance. Dynamic range is also a concern. The Mark III will remain the clear choice for videographers, as the 5DS removes key features like the headphone jack and HDMI output. And just how many Canon lenses out there will be able to take advantage of the sharper canvas afforded by the sensor?\nBut for advanced photographers who work in controlled light situations, the $3,699 5DS (and the $3,899 5DS R, a variant that removes anti-aliasing for sharper images) should be warmly received. The megapixel wars have been ignited once again, and the previous resolution champion, Nikon\u2019s 36-megapixel D810, has a serious new competitor. Ahead of next week\u2019s CP+, the biggest camera show in Japan, it\u2019s clear that Canon has come out swinging.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nThe price you pay for an ultra-compact body is the bulky viewfinder accessory.\nUnlike the first EOS M, the ring around the shutter release can be used as a basic exposure modifier. Coupled with the dial on the back, this is by far Canon's easiest mirrorless camera to use in manual mode.\nThe EOS M3 is a small package even with the longest zoom lens available for the system, the 55-200mm f\/4.5-6.3.\nUnfortunately, the unimpressive lens selection remains the biggest reason not to buy into Canon's system (along with the company's apparent lack of desire to release new cameras in the US.)  Canon really needs more options like the compact 22mm f\/2 prime on the far left.\nAt first glance, there's not a lot to separate the EOS 5DS from the 5D Mark III. Buttons and overall design are pretty much identical.\nCanon's new 11-24mm f\/4 lens is the widest-angle rectilinear zoom lens in the world.\nThe 5DS next to the 5DS R, which should give slightly sharper images despite the occasional annoying moir√© pattern on fine textures.\n","Title":"Up close with Canon's impressive new cameras | The Verge","Tags":["photography","hands--on","photo-essay","tech"]}
