{"Main text":"Leaked Windows 10 build reveals new Xbox app and Cortana integration\nAn early look at consumer features\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nMicrosoft is currently readying an updated preview of Windows 10 to focus on the consumer features of the upcoming operating system. While the company plans to detail those  improvements at a January press event , a consumer build (9901) has leaked out onto the web today to provide an early look at the various changes Microsoft is making.\nThe biggest new feature since the recent technical preview is the addition of Cortana. A  video demonstration leaked earlier this month , but the build itself shows how Cortana sits at the top of the search interface for Windows 10, responding to text and voice commands. It\u2019s all very similar to the Windows Phone version, as you\u2019d expect, with access to the notebook, reminders, and interests. It's not entirely functional, but it\u2019s a very early look at the digital assistant in Windows 10 so the final version will likely change significantly.\nA new Xbox app acts as a gateway to Xbox Live\nElsewhere there\u2019s also a new Xbox app. It appears to act as a gateway to the entire Xbox ecosystem, including access to achievements, friends lists, activity feeds, and the Store. Microsoft notes that it\u2019s an early preview of the app, so it may well include SmartGlass integration in future. It\u2019s also a first glimpse at how the software maker is designing its native Windows 10 apps, and the calculator app has been updated in a similar way.\n","Title":"Leaked Windows 10 build reveals new Xbox app and Cortana integration | The Verge","Tags":["microsoft","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5910988"]}
