{"Main text":"Vessyl is the smart cup that knows exactly what you're drinking\nCan more transparency help you drink more water?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nAs a biomedical computing student at Queen\u2019s University seven years ago, Justin Lee knew he wanted to build his own \"internet of things\" device \u2014 but he didn\u2019t want it to be any old \"smart\" lamp, toaster, or light switch. \"I wanted to put a computer into one of the most ubiquitous objects in the history of the human race,\" he says. He chose the cup. Then, he enlisted Yves Béhar, the esteemed designer behind Jawbone and the OLPC, to build it.\nThe result is Vessyl , a 13-ounce cup that recognizes any beverage you pour into it, displays its nutritional content, and syncs all your drinking habits to your smartphone. Let\u2019s cut to the chase: while I only had an hour with a Vessyl prototype, I tried nearly a dozen beverages in it \u2014 and it successfully identified all of them. Within 10 seconds, the device, which currently resembles more of a Thermos than a finished product, recognized Crush orange soda, Vitamin Water XXX, Tropicana orange juice, Gatorade Cool Blue, plain-old water, and a few other beverages, all by name. Yes, this cup knows the difference between Gatorade Cool Blue and Glacier Freeze.\nVessyl can tell the difference between strong and weak coffee, Lee says, noting caffeine disparities. It can even measure the sugar, protein, calories, fat, and caffeine inside any beverage you pour into it, mass-produced or homemade. As you go about your day, the device tracks how much you\u2019re drinking, and when you tilt Vessyl to its back, it displays a bright blue line that rises and falls to indicate your hydration level. Lee plans to ship Vessyl in early 2015 at a cost of $199.99, though preorders are available now for $99.\nBuilding a smart cup made even more sense once Lee started thinking about the various ways we track our movement, but not what we\u2019re eating. Even sleek apps like Up Coffee , which tracks your caffeine consumption, require you to input your consumption manually drink by drink. The big idea behind Vessyl is to provide transparency, automatically, about how terrible most of our drinking habits are. And Vessyl might just succeed. Many of us already carry around some kind of water bottle, after all, be it a Nalgene bottle or Kleen Kanteen, and Vessyl can take advantage of that habit.\nNext\n\"Consumption is as important or more important as what we track through exercise,\" says Lee, \"so we developed a sensor that could instantly analyze the nutritional content of what\u2019s inside a beverage \u2026 on a molecular level.\" Lee won\u2019t say exactly how the sensor works. He likens it to the kind of sensor you\u2019d find in a bottling factory that analyzes batches of liquid (or other foods) to make sure each batch is consistent. \"It\u2019s the kind of sensor you\u2019d use for quality control,\" Lee says, \"and the sensor doesn\u2019t degrade. It\u2019s non-contact.\"\nThere\u2019s no hole, or singular point where Vessyl samples what you\u2019re drinking \u2014 it just looks like an über-modern, but empty, cup. I press Lee for more information about how it works, but he won\u2019t budge. \"The details of the sensor we\u2019re keeping pretty close to the vest,\" he says, but notes that the device includes a processor and algorithms that match your beverage to one of thousands of beverages his team has tested with Vessyl. (And yes, Vessyl recognizes many kinds of beer and wine). Perhaps more impressive, however, is that Vessyl actually measures and displays the nutritional content of any beverage on the spot, even your homemade smoothie. In other words, Vessyl isn\u2019t just drawing from its drink library when it displays nutritional data.\nVessyl is a neat party trick \u2014 until you start using it to actually make better habits. The content of every beverage you drink syncs back to your smartphone over Bluetooth low energy, but you can also choose one metric for the Vessyl cup to display on its side. When you pour coffee into Vessyl, for example, its display will read \"coffee\" \u2014 but you can choose whether Vessyl then displays the total mg of caffeine you've consumed today, or some other metric. Above this tiny display is a line that Lee calls Pryme, a measurement of how hydrated you are. Pryme is a proprietary hydration metric calculated using your height, weight, and other characteristics that you enter into the Vessyl app.\nIf you\u2019re perfectly hydrated, Lee says, the Pryme bar will be full and a small blue light will illuminate above it. But as you go about your day, your Pryme will deplete. To activate the Pryme display at any time, you just pick up Vessyl and tilt it away from you. An accelerometer inside the device recognizes the gestures and illuminates the Pryme bar. The gesture is so natural and simple that some Vessyl users might not choose to check their stats inside the app, which displays your drinks over the course of a day along a sleek timeline. They might just tilt to check on their Pryme, and if they\u2019re low, will bounce over to the kitchen for a refill.\nThere\u2019s no metal wristband to strap on every morning\nVessyl\u2019s greatest potential lies in its Pryme display. What person wouldn\u2019t appreciate a simple indicator of how much water they should drink every day? You can indeed use Vessyl without the app after initial setup, which could truly separate Vessyl from most other fitness trackers and quantified-self gadgets on the market. Nike\u2019s omnipresent NikeFuel points indicator is, arguably, one of the gadget\u2019s most appealing aspects. But Vessyl\u2019s strength is that unlike these other trackers, it combines effortless tracking with a behavior you\u2019re already doing. There\u2019s no metal wristband to strap on every morning, and no fob to clip to your pants pocket. If you leave Vessyl on its charging coaster while you sleep or are at your desk, you might forget that it\u2019s a \"smart cup\" entirely. One 60-minute charge provides a week of power, Lee says. The big idea is to help you stay better hydrated on a daily basis, and while Vessyl won't send you a push notification quite yet when you're not drinking enough, they might not be far off.\nVessyl\u2019s primary virtue is that it\u2019s easy to understand. \"Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge, at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life,\" says Béhar. If Vessyl can succeed in accurately measuring what you\u2019re drinking day after day, as Lee says it will, it just might be the first quantified-self tracker I could recommend to anyone.\n","Title":"Vessyl is the smart cup that knows exactly what you're drinking | The Verge","Tags":["report","design","tech"]}
