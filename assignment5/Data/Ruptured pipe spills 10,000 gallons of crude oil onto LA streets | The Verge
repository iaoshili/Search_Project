{"Main text":"Ruptured pipe spills 10,000 gallons of crude oil onto LA streets\nOil geyser reportedly doused a nearby strip joint, but no one has been hurt\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Los Angeles Fire Department  reports that an oil pipe has burst overnight, estimating that over 10,000 gallons of crude oil have been spilled over a half-mile area. The rupture has come at a section above ground and was initially thought to be much worse, with estimates being revised down from a vast million gallons of runoff to 50,000 to the current figure. The LAFD has now contained the spill, the oil line has been shut off, and everything is being returned to normal \u2014 with no reported injuries \u2014 but areas remain where the oil is said to be \"knee-high.\"\nAmong the businesses affected by this spillage was a nearby strip club, which the AP reports was evacuated without incident. The local NBC station says that \"oil was seen shooting 15 to 20 feet upward in the sky\" before landing onto The Gentlemen's Club in Atwater Village.\nUpdate May 15th, 9:59AM: The LAFD has  revised its estimate down to a figure of 10,000 gallons of oil. This article has been updated to reflect the changing numbers.\nCrude oil runs down street uncontained heading towards more businesses in Atwater Village. pic.twitter.com\/fObzwdrvlO\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
