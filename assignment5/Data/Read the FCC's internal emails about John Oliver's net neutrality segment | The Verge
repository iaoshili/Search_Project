{"Main text":"Read the FCC's internal emails about John Oliver's net neutrality segment\n'We had a good laugh about it. The cable companies... not so much.'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nBack in June, you may remember Last Week Tonight With John Oliver had  a great bit on net neutrality. Oliver poked fun at the FCC commissioners; he compared Chairman Tom Wheeler, a former telecom lobbyist, to a dingo. The internet had a laugh, and the day after, FCC employees went back to work.\nAs part of a Freedom of Information Act request sent by The Verge, the FCC sent email exchanges between employees that show how the FCC responded. The reviews: mostly positive, with some reservations.\nDeborah Taylor Tate, a former commissioner who's now a \"special envoy\" at the International Telecommunication Union, saw the video and sent a free-verse email alert to her old colleagues.\nComm O was on a comic show\nLast week tonight\nMob shakedown etc goes on for 20 mini\nComcast stories etc\nWho watches this?\nBrian Roberts also lambasted also\n\"Comm O\" apparently refers to Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, who takes some heat in Oliver's video; the \"mob shakedown\" refers to a joke Oliver makes about  Comcast's negotiations with Netflix . \"George Foot\" is likely about a telecom lawyer who appears in the video (actually spelled \"Foote\").\nAnother email chain started with Anne Lucey, senior vice president of regulatory policy at CBS, who sent a link to the video to FCC employees Courtney Reinhard and Erin McGrath. They have a laugh at jokes about cable companies never showing up on time, and Reinhard suggests those companies weren't pleased about the video. Reinhard has since left her FCC position for a new job; she's now vice president of federal government relations at Verizon.\nLucey: Rather long, but quite entertaining ....... and your boss is featured -at around 1:18...!\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fpbOEo RrHyU\nMcGrath: We were watching this this morning. He is show twice, The second time is toward the end.\nReinhard: We had a good laugh about it. The cable companies... not so much.\nLucey: Love the Monopoly car....!\nReinhard: That was classic. I loved the comparison of the promise to comply with the NN\nLucey: Ha. And Nutflix pretty funny, too. Who knew NN could be fodder for comedy?\nMcGrath: I liked the Usain Bolt graphic. Then again, am stil touchy about the not showing up during specified hours thing. The whole clip was pretty funny.\nBut soon Oliver's call to action brought thousands of visitors to the FCC website, apparently causing it to shut down. In another conversation, Lucey forwards a CNET article called \" John Oliver's Net neutrality response swamps FCC .\"\nReinhard: This cracks me up!\nMcGrath: Priceless!!!!!!\nLucey: Read via the link -it has the tweets the FCC sent out alerting the public to the jam-up\nMcGrath: Don't eat ma baby!\nLucey: Ok, gals, I wanna set the record straight: The dingo REALLY DID eat that woman's baby.\nhttp:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2012\/06\/11\/world\/asia\/australia-dingo-inguest\/\nMcGrath: Yes, I know.\nReporters started flooding the FCC with questions about Oliver, according to the documents, and the FCC fielded dozens of media requests, telling reporters it was unclear if Oliver had crashed the site, but that they had experienced a traffic spike. One reporter asked:\nAny comment from the chairman on John Oliver's suggestion that he protesteth too much and might ACTUALLY be a dingo?\"\nTo which an FCC spokesperson responds:\nHey John, no, no comment on that :)\nTwo weeks later, Oliver made  a followup video about the FCC's response.\nCommissioner O'Rielly seemed to take it in stride, sending some of the staff  a Recode article about the video and ribbing Chairman Wheeler about a press conference. (There's not enough context to say whether it was in good humor.) The entire note was a subject line:\nafter seeing the press conference, everyone could have this coming...unless maybe a dingo.\nYou can read the documents below:\n","Title":"Read the FCC's internal emails about John Oliver's net neutrality segment | The Verge","Tags":["policy","culture","tldr","us-world","entertainment","tech"]}
