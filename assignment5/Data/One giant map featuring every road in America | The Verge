{"Main text":"One giant map featuring every road in America\nWhere we're going, we really need roads\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThis map, featuring every road in the United States of America, assembled by Reddit user WestCoastBestCoast94, looks like a cartographer's dream come true. It doesn't take an expert to glean information from the map, like the location of major cities \u2014 dark, tight webs \u2014 and mountains \u2014 long, thin stretches of white.\nYou can find more debatable takeaways within this map, too. For me, it reads like a testament to the ingenuity and strength of the American roadway, and a critique of its astounding inefficiency.\nI've included five of America's finest states below, but you can find all 50 states here .\nUpdate: Credit to commenter cass4504 for linking to  Fathom's All Streets project . The maps can be purchased for $40 at the company's website.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
