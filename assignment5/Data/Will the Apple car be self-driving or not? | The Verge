{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt\u2019s only been a few days since multiple publications started pointing us toward the possibility of an Apple car. (It\u2019s so fresh that the phrase \"Apple car\" still feels a little odd to write.) In all likelihood, an actual car is years away from introduction \u2014 if Tim Cook and company decide to release it at all. Yet there\u2019s already a rift growing in this young rumor mill: will Cupertino\u2019s take on the future of transportation be capable of driving itself? The Wall Street Journal says no ; Reuters says yes .\nThe truth is they\u2019re both likely right.\nThe apparent disagreement in scoops from two of the world\u2019s preeminent news sources speaks to a PR problem that has been plaguing the auto industry for years. \"Self-driving\" isn\u2019t an atomic, yes-or-no feature; it\u2019s a blanket phrase referring to an entire spectrum of capabilities. Some of those are on the road today and have been for years, others are still just a shade or two shy of science fiction. As Reuters notes, \"Autonomous driving is likely to emerge progressively as driver assistance systems become more sophisticated.\"\n\"Self-driving\" isn\u2019t a yes-or-no feature\nEven if an Apple car isn\u2019t fully autonomous \u2014 something like Google\u2019s vision , lacking even a steering wheel \u2014 it won\u2019t ignore autonomous features wholesale.\nIn fact, by the time such a car is on the road, it may not legally be able to ignore them. Some features that fall under the purview of \"self-driving\" are so well established that the federal government has started recommending that automakers include them as standard equipment . So-called crash-imminent braking (CIB) and dynamic braking support (DBS) monitor the road ahead for situations that could cause a collision, and either automatically slow the vehicle down or help the driver apply additional braking to minimize the severity of a crash or prevent it altogether. For a brief, terrifying moment, the car is taking control of a core driving function on the driver\u2019s behalf.\nBut beyond these pre-collision systems, convenience features on a wide variety of modern vehicles combine to closely resemble what you might consider to be \"a self-driving car.\" A car with lane-keep and dynamic cruise control, for instance, can automatically stay in its highway lane and maintain a programmed distance behind the cars ahead of it, going all the way down to a standstill in the event of a traffic jam. Such systems are reliable enough nowadays that you can leave the driver\u2019s seat altogether, as one YouTube poster did (unsafely and unwisely):\nFrom there, it\u2019s a small jump to a system that can safely change highway lanes without driver input. The Tesla Model S, with hardware enhancements included since late last year, can change lanes on its own by tapping the turn signal. Tesla has described its short-term goal for automated driving as \"on-ramp to off-ramp,\" meaning that the car takes care of everything while you\u2019re on a highway \u2014 it\u2019s only on surface streets that you need to drive on your own.\nApple is notoriously deliberate about its approach to adding bells and whistles to its products; it\u2019s rarely a first mover. (Just look at Apple Pay and Touch ID as recent examples \u2014 neither feature was first to market, but both are the best implementations in their class.) And no one is suggesting the Apple car is close to release \u2014 by all appearances, they just started working on it last year. That\u2019s a blink of an eye on the glacial scale of automotive R&D. By the time an Apple car is on sale, it wouldn\u2019t be viable in the marketplace without some manner of autonomous capability. It\u2019d be akin to selling a car today without a USB port or Bluetooth connectivity, or selling a car in 2016 that doesn\u2019t support either CarPlay or Android Auto. Yes, you might be able to do it, but unless you\u2019re playing in the very bottom end of the market \u2014 a place Apple is not known to go \u2014 it won\u2019t fly.\nIt would be a shock if Apple aimed for full autonomy with version one\nNor is WSJ wrong when it writes that \"A self-driving car is not part of Apple\u2019s current plan\"; in all likelihood, it\u2019s semantics. We\u2019re still many years away from a production car that can reliably (and legally) navigate urban environments, crowded intersections, and complex city traffic patterns in all weather. It would be a shock if Apple aimed for that level of autonomy with version one, but it would be equally surprising if it came to market without the modern basics like pre-collision. Within a couple years, more advanced capabilities like dynamic cruise will become standard fare, too.\nSo yes, paradoxically, an Apple car can be self-driving and be not self-driving at the same time. Reuters can be right, WSJ can be right, everyone wins \u2014 except incumbent automakers, perhaps.\n","Title":"Will the Apple car be self-driving or not? | The Verge","Tags":["apple","report","tech","transportation\",\"Story Streams\"","\"7836892"]}
