{"Main text":"Please don't drool on this 15-foot mural honoring classic Star Wars figurines\nAll your friends are here: Luke, Boba Fett... Indiana Jones?\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nArtist Robert Burden has carved his own niche as a painter of classic children's toys. His latest piece is a 15-foot-wide mural celebrating classic Star Wars toys.\nHis work spans my childhood: Voltron, Captain America, GI Joe. A personal favorite is this portrait of Krang , inspired by the 1988 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figurine of the same name. I like the rich gold and blues in the painting, but my favorite decision is the custom golden Krangs built into the frame.\nOn a superficial level, Burden's paintings call to mindÂ  Kehinde Wiley 's work, which use classic portraits and styles on modern subjects. Though that's really where the comparison ends. Not to say I don't enjoy Burden's paintings. I would be honored to have this 15-foot behemoth covering a wall of of my living room. Fans, particularly of Star Wars, often treat their old toys like precious treasures and artifacts. It's fitting that they should be painted as such.\nLook closely, and you'll spot a few non-canonical guest stars.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
