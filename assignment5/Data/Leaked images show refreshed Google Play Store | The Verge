{"Main text":"Leaked images show refreshed Google Play Store\nMaterial Design brings a clean new look\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nA number of screenshots leaked by Android Police illustrate how Google'sÂ  visual language Material Design might be applied to its Play Store app. They depict a cleaner-looking store with a big focus on hero images, minimalist listings with only sparse amounts of information, and of course, Material Design's hallmark \"cards.\" While arguably more attractive, the redesign may necessitate a lot more swiping.\nThe modifications are especially noticeable in their tablet incarnations, but the phone interface shares similar traits. Android Police posits that the Play Store changes will probably surface with the launch of Android L. It's likely the new interface will see a few more alterations before then \u2014 the Newsstand and Books sections of the redesigned store currently appear incomplete, for example \u2014 but this sneak peek provides an idea as to what the next incarnation of the Play Store might look like. However, as these are pre-release builds, there are no guarantees they'll make it to the finish line.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
