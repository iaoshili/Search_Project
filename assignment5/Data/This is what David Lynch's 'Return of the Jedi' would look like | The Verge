{"Main text":"This is what David Lynch's 'Return of the Jedi' would look like\nYouTube recut imagines if 'Eraserhead' director had helmed third 'Star Wars'\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nDavid Lynch infamously turned down the opportunity to direct Return of The Jedi when George Lucas offered it to him back in the early 1980s, but what if he hadn't? YouTube user C-SPIT has gone ahead and  created a trailer for that never-made movie, recutting scenes from Jedi in pure Lynchian style, complete with lots of creepy dissolves, out-of-context screams, and other singularly horrific elements from the third Star Wars film. The resulting short clip would not be out of place alongside Lynch's other classic, eerie films Eraserhead, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Drive, not to mention the sci-fi film he actually directed, 1984's Dune. And in case you're wondering why Lynch passed on Jedi in the first place, watch this 2010 interview clip in which he recounts meeting Lucas and developing a headache after learning about Wookies.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
