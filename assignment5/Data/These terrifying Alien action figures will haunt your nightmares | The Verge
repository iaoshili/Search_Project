{"Main text":"These terrifying Alien action figures will haunt your nightmares\nDayton Allen is sculpting the toys that never were\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nPeople express their fandom in different ways. Some write fan fiction, while others get into cosplay. Dayton Allen, meanwhile, builds stunningly detailed sculptures of his favorite sci-fi movies. Until 2012, that work was reserved for recreating characters and scenes from Star Wars; he's built beautiful figures of everyone from Darth Vader to the Yuuzhan Vong aliens from the expanded universe. But more recently he decided to tackle his favorite film, one that never really had proper action figures of its own \u2014 the original Alien from 1979.\n\"Alien is an art film,\" he says of his fascination with the sci-fi horror classic. \"Its origins come from artists and designers that shaped what we consider modern science fiction today.\"\nUnlike the first Star Wars, which had a wealth of action figures featuring virtually every character in the film, the first Alien never had a proper toy line of its own. Though one was planned back in 1979 and prototypes were built, Kenner ultimately cancelled the idea before the toys went to manufacturing. (Toy company Super7 released its own figures in 2013 based on the original prototypes.)\n\"Nothing is without complexity.\"\nFor Allen, this made Alien an ideal project to tackle: not only was it his favorite sci-fi movie, but he'd also be helping to fill in a gap. \"One of things I most enjoy about the hobby is creating figures and environments which the current toy industry would never consider producing,\" he explains.\nIt's still a work in progress, but Allen's Alien project is a wonderfully detailed and complex recreation of the film, at 1:18 scale. Built in his spare time \u2014 Allen is a graphic designer by day \u2014 so far he's managed to complete several characters, most of the terrifying xenomorph, and a good chunk of the interior of the Nostromo spaceship. \"Since I'm not on a payroll to complete the work on a deadline,\" he says of the project, \"I take my time and enjoy the ride.\"\nThe process starts with a lot of reference material \u2014 screencaps from the films, behind-the-scenes-photography, and other production-related imagery. Allen has even gone so far as to talk to some of the original production crew to suss out some of the finer details. After that, he gathers the right materials \u2014 he builds figures and sets out of everything from epoxies and clay to laser-cut MDF board \u2014 which is followed by the pain-staking process of modeling and sculpting the figures. \"This being a Ridley Scott film,\" explains Allen, \"nothing is without complexity.\"\nMany of the figures still need to be painted, and the ship's interior is still missing a few areas. Allen hopes to complete all of the characters by next year, though the ship will likely take a bit longer. It doesn't help that he's already taken a few detours \u2014 he recently started another set based on the Alien: Isolation video game , and is working on a new model from Alien 3.\n\"The project simply doesn't end with the first film,\" he says. \"But it is the most important to me.\"\n","Title":"These terrifying Alien action figures will haunt your nightmares | The Verge","Tags":["culture","photo-essay","design","entertainment"]}
