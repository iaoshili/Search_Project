{"Main text":"'Jurassic World' director confirms leaked story details\n'Jurassic Park 4' takes place 22 years after the first movie\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSpoiler warning: the following story contains details about Jurassic World's setting, characters, and plot.\nJurassic World is set to be released next summer , but director Colin Trevorrow has kept largely quiet about plot details, taking to Twitter only to confirm that  the fourth film in the Jurassic Park franchise would fly in the face of science by  including featherless dinosaurs . But after a report published last week purported to include a wealth of plot details, Trevorrow has changed his approach, describing Jurassic World's setting, structure, and characters in a  spoiler-packed interview with SlashFilm .\nThe director confirmed that most of the  details leaked last week were indeed accurate. The movie will take place 22 years after the original Jurassic Park, and will be set on the same island of Isla Nublar, which now boasts a \"fully functional\" dinosaur park that sees 20,000 visitors a year. Trevorrow describes the park as \"the realization of [Jurassic Park's fictional tycoon] John Hammond's dream,\" but also says that because our relationship with technology has changed so much since 1993's Jurassic Park, some of the new guests are \"already kind of over\" being able to see live dinosaurs in the flesh. \"We imagined a teenager texting his girlfriend with his back to a T-Rex behind protective glass,\" the director says.\nSome guests are \"already kind of over\" dinosaurs\nBut Trevorrow also shot down one of the the leaked report's key details that suggested that lead character Chris Pratt would be training a group of \"good guy\" dinosaurs to fight against a larger dino-antagonist. \"There's no such thing as good or bad dinosaurs, says Trevorrow. \"There are predators and prey. This film is about our relationship with animals, how we react to the threat they pose to our dominance on earth as a species.\" Pratt's character, he admits, is performing behavioural research on the movie's Velociraptors, but the (inaccurately large) theropods \"aren't trained,\" and \"they can't do tricks.\"\nVelociraptors \"can't do tricks\"\nMore accurate was the report's assessment that the movie's antagonist would be a genetically modified super-dinosaur. \"We were hoping audiences could discover this on their own,\" the director says, \"but yes, there will be one new dinosaur created by the park's geneticists.\" To reassure sticklers for believability in a movie about resurrected dinosaurs, Trevorrow confirms the new beast won't deviate too far from the dinosaur template. \"It doesn't have a snake's head or octopus tentacles,\" he says, but it was created to \"fulfill a corporate mandate.\" Jurassic World's money men wanted \"something bigger, louder, with more teeth.\"\nTrevorrow exudes sadness in his responses, wistful for a time when movies were kept secret until they were seen. \"When I was a kid, you got to discover everything at once, it washed over you and blew your mind. Now it only takes one person to spoil it for everyone else.\" Forced into corroborating a report that describes a cuttlefish\/snake\/T-Rex\/Velociraptor hybrid, Trevorrow hits out at the people who revealed the information ahead of time. \"I hope whoever leaked it is actively trying to undermine what we're doing,\" he says. \"Because if they're trying to help, they're doing it wrong.\"\n","Title":"'Jurassic World' director confirms leaked story details | The Verge","Tags":["culture","entertainment"]}
