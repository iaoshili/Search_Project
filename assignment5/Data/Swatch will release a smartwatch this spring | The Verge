{"Main text":"Swatch will release a smartwatch this spring\nJust in time to compete with the Apple Watch\nShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nSwiss watchmaker Swatch will launch a new smartwatch in the next two to three months, according to various reports . That would place the launch right alongside the April release window that Tim Cook outlined for the Apple Watch's release earlier this month. Details are scant, but a few of the watch's functions have already been made public. It will include \"communication\" abilities and applications compatible with Windows and Android. The watch will also be capable of making mobile payments, though right now the only known partners are Swiss grocery stores Migros and Coop.\nBut the feature that might give Swatch its biggest advantage is that the smartwatch won't have to be charged. Even well before its release, battery life is already a major point of contention for the Apple Watch, with rumors placing it at just under a day's worth. The battery life of other smartwatches is all over the map, from the Moto 360 (one day) to the Pebble Steel (five to seven days). A Swatch spokesperson told The Next Web that this new smartwatch will be different from the company's existing Smart Touch watch, which will receive its own update later this month.\nYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and\/or partners.\nForgot password?\nWe'll email you a reset link.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot username?\nWe'll email it to you.\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nForgot password?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nForgot username?\nIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\nTry another email?\nAlmost done,\nBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\nAuthenticating\nGreat!\nChoose an available username to complete sign up.\nIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
