{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nGoogle\u2019s Project Ara modular smartphone project is arriving soon, at least if you\u2019re in Puerto Rico. At its Project Ara Module Developers Conference today, Google said that it plans to launch a pilot in Puerto Rico in the second half of this year, selling phone chassis and modules through local carrier partners, as well as through a fleet of small trucks.\nGoogle today said there\u2019s still lots of work to be done before you find it at stores in the US and elsewhere. The multi-phase project is currently in phase 2, or what Google calls \u201CSpiral 2.\u201D It\u2019s gone from something that can connect only to Wi-Fi to one that supports 3G wireless, with Google\u2019s Advanced Technology and Projects group saying that it\u2019s working on carrier deals to help get this on store shelves at some point. Still ahead are things like adding support for 4G LTE, as well as a way for developers to make and sell modules that will work with these devices. Google also still needs to figure out how much all this will cost, and whether consumers will grok the idea of buying a bunch of tiny parts that can dramatically change the way their phone operates.\nThis is our most comprehensive, up close look at Ara so far. Here\u2019s where Google\u2019s at right now.\nPhotos from Google ATAP.\nHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\nVerge Video Archives: Project Ara - Building the Modular Smartphone\n","Title":"This is Google\u2019s latest Project Ara prototype | The Verge","Tags":["google","photo-essay","tech\",\"Story Streams\"","\"5366009"]}
