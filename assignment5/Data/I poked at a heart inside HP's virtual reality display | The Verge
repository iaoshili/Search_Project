{"Main text":"Next\nThe second demo that HP ran on the Zvr shows how its tech could actually be put to use. This demo presents a model of a beating human heart. You're able to pick it up and spin it around to study the heart's outside, but you're also able to zap away layers so that you can see what's happening on the inside, where valves are opening and closing and running into different chambers.\nIt's obvious how you could learn this way\nThough the visuals were extremely blocky in the demo, the Zvr's 23.6-inch display is able to output 1080p into each eye. That means that a designer or an educational institution that really wants to put this display to use should be able to work with something a lot more detailed. What HP showed is certainly an engaging way to teach some basics about the heart, but it's easy to see how, using a more detailed model, the interactivity the Zvr allows could be far more intuitive for many learners than looking at a diagram on a page or playing with a model using a mouse. Digital learning tools are obviously nothing new \u2014 and HP doesn't exactly make a compelling argument for its display being the best solution \u2014 but it certainly appears that something like the Zvr could be a viable option.\nHP isn't building the Zvr on its own. It's partnering with a company called zSpace that appears to be handling most of the software and hardware design, meaning that HP may primarily be responsible for turning that design into reality. In a demo of the product just over a year ago, zSpace said that it was selling models of its display for $4,000Â \u2014 though that model was somewhat different than what HP is presenting today. The overall tech is the same, however, and you can get a sense for how it works in the video below.\n","Title":"I poked at a heart inside HP's virtual reality display | The Verge","Tags":["tech","ces-2015"]}
