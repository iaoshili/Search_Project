VFor the past two days, security researchers have descended on Vancouver for  a Google-sponsored contest called Pwn2Own , which offers top-dollar prizes for anyone who can publicly exploit bugs in popular browsers and other widely used software like Adobe Flash.\u000aMore than half a million dollars for 21 bugs\u000aThis year was a particularly lucrative one, as a researcher named JungHoon Lee (also known as lokihardt) came away from the contest with a record $225,000 for three bugs, affecting Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari. The Chrome bug was the most lucrative, earning $110,000 in total, bringing in extra money because it involved a beta version of Chrome and because Lee was able to exploit the bug into system access. The Chrome bug was revealed in a single two-minute presentation, which, as one observer pointed out, put Lee's earnings at $916 per second.\u000aAt the end of the contest, all vulnerabilities are privately disclosed to vendors in the "Chamber of Disclosures." It's a particularly high-stakes version of a bug bounty program, a system that has become increasingly popular as companies look for legal ways to discover weaknesses before attackers do. This year's contest found 21 bugs in total \u2014 including five bugs in Windows, four bugs in Internet Explorer, and three bugs in Firefox \u2014 and paid a total of $557,500 to participating researchers.\u000a

VAlcatel's new flagship smartphones have high-end features, low-end prices\u000aAnd they're coming to the US\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIf you're familiar with the name Alcatel Onetouch at all, you probably associate it with low-end phones that aren't particularly exciting. Those low-end phones have been the company's bread and butter here in the US, and have helped it move up the rankings of smartphone makers. With the new Idol 3, a high-end smartphone being announced at Mobile World Congress today, Alcatel is looking to change that perception.\u000aThe Idol 3 is actually a pair of smartphones: a larger, 5.5.-inch model, and a smaller, 4.7-inch version. Both of the phones share many characteristics and features, but the 5.5-inch Idol 3 has a full 1080p display compared to the 4.7's 720p panel, a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor (the 4.7 has a quad-core Snapdragon 400 series chip), larger battery, and more RAM and internal storage. Both have 13-megapixel rear cameras with wide-aperture lenses and LED flashes. The 5.5-inch model has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, while the 4.7-inch version makes do with a 5-megapixel front camera. The phones have dual front-facing speakers powered by JBL, and interestingly, two microphones, so you can pick up the phone in any orientation and answer a call. Both phones are sleek and slim (about 7.5mm thick), and could easily be mistaken for a better known brand.\u000aThe Idol 3 will sell for under $250 unlocked in the US\u000aBut perhaps the most interesting part of the Idol 3 is that Alcatel is selling them in the US, and for not a lot of money. The 5.5-inch model will sell for under $250, while the 4.7-inch Idol 3 will go for under $200. Both will be sold unlocked through Alcatel's web store in the US and support LTE on either AT&T or T-Mobile. The Idol 3 is the first flagship phone that Alcatel is bringing to the US\u000aThere are lots of phones flooding the market at ultra-low price points, many of which bring along rather impressive design and user experiences. But the pair of Alcatel phones are notable in that they don't look like cheap smartphones at all. Even the Motorola Moto G and Moto E , both of which are great inexpensive phones in their own rights, mostly look the part. In contrast, the Alcatel's have bright, laminated displays with great viewing angles (which Alcatel says was tuned by Technicolor), fast performance, loud speakers, and clean, attractive designs. Most of those features have been reserved for high-end, expensive smartphones until now. The Idol 3 units I saw don't quite hit the high marks set by HTC and Apple when it comes to build quality, but when you can get three 5.5-inch Idol 3s for the cost of one iPhone 6 Plus, it's easy to excuse that.\u000aThe Idol 3 runs Android 5.0.2 Lollipop with Alcatel's slightly-customized user interface. There's a daily digest pane to the left of the main homescreen that displays weather, calendar appointments, news headlines, and more. It reminds me of HTC's BlinkFeed. The Onetouch Mix app lets you mix two songs together from music stored on the device or streamed from Rdio, complete with faders and scratching. It's neat, if not quite an app that most people will use very often.\u000aCheap phones are getting really good\u000aThere's plenty of room for criticism on Alcatel's new phones: they copy other devices' sizes, they copy some software features, they copy some hardware features, etc. But the fact of the matter is none of that really matters. Copycat or not, inexpensive phones are getting really, really good, and that benefits everyone who buys smartphones, whether you're willing to pay $250 or $750 for one.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThis morning, J.J. Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy kicked off the annual Star Wars Celebration convention in a very big way. Original cast members Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew were all there (Harrison Ford couldn't make it due to his recent plane crash ), as well as new cast members: Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega. And then, of course, there was the trailer \u2014 and the first new look at Han Solo audiences have gotten in 32 years.\u000aWe learned a lot of new information, so we've collected it all here for you. Here's everything we found out about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u000aThat wasn't Tatooine we saw in the first teaser.\u000aThe first teaser last December featured a sandy planet that many naturally assumed was the series mainstay Tatooine. It turns out, it wasn't: it's a planet called Jakku, and is home to Daisy Ridley's character.\u000aJ.J. Abrams originally said no.\u000aWhile we knew there had been some back and forth before Abrams agreed to direct the project, he explained that when producer Kathleen Kennedy originally approached him, he declined because it didn't fit into the larger plan his family had in place. However, once he started brainstorming what a new Star Wars movie would look like, that changed.\u000aThat new droid BB-8 is real.\u000aThe strange, whirring, soccer ball-meets-R2 unit droid we saw in the teaser? It turns out that thing is actually real. Mark Hamill told this to Yahoo Movies back in December, but seeing is believing. Abrams and the film's team brought out an actual working version of the droid onto stage, as it rolled around, looking back and forth at R2-D2. We don't know how they're pulling it off exactly, but it's full of personality \u2014 and is no doubt going to be a tremendously fun character in the film.\u000aWookies like to get behind the camera, too.\u000aAbrams showed off several behind-the-scenes photos from the making of the film, including him directing a Stormtrooper and a moment with a very familiar-looking furry creature.\u000aThey built several new R2-unit domes for The Force Awakens.\u000aSome of the designers from the new film explained that they created multiple, squared-off domes for new R2 units in the film. They'll be seen in action with X-Wing pilots in the movies. They're known as R0 units \u2014 and one of the crew's personal favorite is R0-LO.\u000aWho is Rey?\u000aDaisy Ridley revealed that her character Rey works as a scavenger at a shipyard on Jakku. That is, until she crosses paths with another character \u2014 and everything changes.\u000aWho is Finn?\u000aJohn Boyega silently conceded that his character was a Stormtrooper \u2014 but what kind of Stormtrooper, or whether he was a "good guy or a bad guy" is still up in the air.\u000aWho is Poe Dameron?\u000aAccording to actor Oscar Isaac, Dameron is "the best pilot in the galaxy" who is "sent on a mission by a princess." This puts him squarely in the Han Solo seat, and according to Isaac, Dameron ends up teaming with Finn. After that, "their fates are forever intertwined."\u000aJohn Boyega was scared to tell his family he was in Star Wars.\u000aThe actor was so superstitious at the prospect of being part of the saga that he was reluctant to tell his parents he was cast until the official cast photo was finally posted online. Even though he was going out on meetings and reading script pages printed on an impossible-to-copy red paper, "I just told them I was filming 24."\u000aThere are more female characters on the way.\u000aThere had been a lot of criticism about the initial Star Wars casting announcements because Daisy Ridley was the only woman \u2014 an issue that affected the original trilogy as well. While several additional actresses have since been cast in The Force Awakens, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy went out of her way to point out that many more female characters would show up in future films. "I wouldn't have had a lot of choices" if she wanted to pick what Star Wars character she would be as a child, Kennedy said. "That's going to change."\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aGiven the number of major flight crashes and disappearances this year, it might seem like flight safety has taken a bad turn. But it turns out that 2014 hasn't actually been a statistically worse year than many of those in the recent past. As pointed out  by The Wall Street Journal , the Aviation Safety Network currently measures both the accident and fatality rate of 2014 flights as falling beneath the 10-year average \u2014 making this year an improvement in some areas.\u000aThere have been fewer accidents but more deaths\u000aNotably, those figures don't include Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, because it was shot down, or the disappearance of a 162-person AirAsia flight this weekend, which is still being investigated. They also disregard planes that can carry fewer than 14 people. But even so, the network measures only 19 accidents for 2014, which is far below the 10-year annual average of 32 accidents. The accident count is actually even lower than it was last year (29), continuing the trend of accident rates dropping to the lowest levels they've been at in decades.\u000aDespite accident rates dropping, deaths from these accidents are rising this year. In 2013, there were 265 deaths from flight accidents \u2014 this year they are currently measured to at 526, and that may rise above the 10-year average of 676 deaths. However, the Journal notes that it's far lower than the 1,074 deaths seen in 2005. That means that even in spite of the high-profile issues this year, flight safety is still showing improvements in some areas.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOn June 30th at precisely 23:59:59, the world\u2019s atomic clocks will pause for a single second. Or, to be more precise, they\u2019ll change to the uncharted time of 23:59:60 \u2014 before ticking over to the more worldly hour of 00:00:00 on the morning of July 1st, 2015. This addition of a leap second,  announced by the Paris Observatory this week , is being added to keep terrestrial clocks in step with the vagaries of astronomical time \u2014 in this case, the slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation. And it's a bit of a headache for computer engineers.\u000aWhat causes leap seconds? Earthquakes, tidal drag, the weather\u000aLeap seconds are like the Y2K bug in that they threaten to throw out of sync time as measured by computers and time as measured by atomic clocks. But while Y2K was a single instance (computer systems that were used to abbreviating the year to two digits were confused by "2000" and "1900"), the addition of leap seconds are a regular problem. The first was added back in 1972; this year\u2019s will be the 26th, and they're  not likely to stop coming . They're also broadly unpredictable: earthquakes, tidal drag, and the weather all affect the rotation of the Earth, and it\u2019s up to the scientists at the  International Earth Rotation Service to keep an eye on things and call the changes as they come.\u000aUnfortunately, when the last leap second was added back in 2012, more than a few sites had trouble keeping pace. As reported by  Phys.org, Foursquare, Reddit, LinkedIn, and StumbledUpon all crashed when the leap second ticked unexpectedly into place. In the case of Reddit, the problem was  eventually traced back to a Linux subsystem that got confused when it checked the Network Time Protocol only to find an extra second.  Speaking to Wired about the problem back in 2012, Linux creator Linus Torvalds commented: "Almost every time we have a leap second, we find something. It\u2019s really annoying, because it\u2019s a classic case of code that is basically never run, and thus not tested by users under their normal conditions."\u000aGoogle solves the problem of the extra second by cutting it into milliseconds\u000aInstead, companies have been forced to create their own workaround, with Google\u2019s "leap smear" perhaps the best-known example. As the company\u2019s site reliability engineer Christopher Pascoe  explained in a blog post , the usual fix is to turn back the clocks by one second at the end of the day, essentially playing that second again. However, says Pascoe, this creates problems: "What happens to write operations that happen during that second? Does email that comes in during that second get stored correctly?" Google\u2019s solution is to cut the extra second into milliseconds and then sprinkle these tiny portions of time into the system imperceptibly throughout the day. "This [means] that when it became time to add an extra second at midnight," says Pascoe, "our clocks [have] already taken this into account, by skewing the time over the course of the day."\u000aCould we detach our concept of time from the solar day?\u000aOf course, not every website or company has the sort of engineering resources needed to implement something like a "leap smear," and when June 30th rolls around in the summer, you can expect to see the odd outage or two. Beyond clever engineering though, there's not much to be done. As  The Telegraph reports , there are some factions in the US that would like to drop the leap second altogether, but doing so would mean unmooring our concept of time from one of the most fundamental timescales, the solar day, and setting civil time on a path forever  diverging from time as measured by our planet . Would it be worth the trouble? We'll get another chance to find out on June 30th.\u000a

VTech\u000a12 Monkeys television series will synchronize with Hue home lighting\u000aSyfy\u2019s original series is the first with a 'light track' that adjusts room lighting to on-screen action\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOwners of Philips Hue light bulbs will have the chance to experience something rather unique with the premiere of  12 Monkeys on Friday, January 16th. The Syfy original drama based upon the 1995 Terry Gilliam film will feature a "light track" that marries the action on the screen to the lighting in your room. Not just once, but for the entirety of the 13-episode season.\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first collaboration between Syfy and Philips. Sharknado 2 also  featured live synchronized Hue lighting when it premiered in July.\u000aThe transmedia lighting experience is controlled by the Syfy Sync app which connects to the Hue bridge and translates audio cues into web-enabled lighting commands. The result is room lighting that helps strike the right mood, with bulbs changing colors to better immerse the viewer in the on-screen action, akin to the effect achieved by those Philips-branded  Ambilight televisions that always look neat but few people buy.\u000aYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and/or partners.\u000aForgot password?\u000aWe'll email you a reset link.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot username?\u000aWe'll email it to you.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot password?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aForgot username?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aAlmost done,\u000aBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\u000aAuthenticating\u000aGreat!\u000aChoose an available username to complete sign up.\u000aIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.

VA flying camera that follows you anywhere is the next evolution of the consumer drone\u000aQuadcopters like Airdog are going fully autonomous, and perfecting the industry's next killer feature\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aBack in June we reported on the Airdog , a Kickstarter project we thought might become the ultimate GoPro sidekick. $1.3 million in funding later , the Airdog is about to start shipping out to backers and getting ready to go on sale later this year. Today at CES we got to check out this drone in person and watch as it followed pro skater Madars Apse through some trick runs on the halfpipe. As drones become an increasingly mainstream consumer product, the next big leap will come from advancements in technology that allows the drones to autonomously fly, follow you, and avoid collisions. Airdog looks like a company with a lot of momentum on all three of those fronts.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aAirdog is the product of Helico Aerospace Industries, a Latvian company founded by CEO Edgars Rozentals, who has been an internet entrepreneur for more than a decade. He's been an action sports buff for a while, then got into flying model helicopters, followed by drones. Airdog was born of these passions and built with the wealth of computer science and engineering talent that is available in Latvia.\u000aWith a top speed of 45 miles per hour and can stay aloft for 10-20 minutes depending on your speed and track your movements from up to 1000 feet away. The unit is currently available for pre-order at $1,295 and has a suggested retail price of $1,495. Since it's meant for use outdoors and during rugged action sports, it's water-resistant and features fold up props so that the entire thing can easily fit into your average backpack.\u000aRozentals and his team began by simply connecting the drone to a smartphone in the user's pocket, relying on GPS for position tracking. But that wasn't very precise. "What we needed to do was both track your position and project where you would be next based on your motion," explains Rozentals.\u000aSo the team added in the Airleash wristband, which is packed with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other sensors that allow it to predict your movement and fly accordingly. Both the position and orientation of the drone, as well as the angle of the camera, are controlled by algorithms that communicate between the leash and the drone. The leash also has some manual controls that allow you to make adjustments to the Airdog while you're riding without having to whip out your smartphone.\u000aAirdog is working on the holy grail of drones: sense and avoid\u000aNext up after following its target is having the Airdog sense and avoid obstacles. The company currently uses maps within its app, so that users can set areas as designated fly or no-fly zones, mark out obstacles like trees and buildings, and chart a race course they want the Airdog to follow them through. Next up is sensors on the drone that would allow it to actually see and avoid obstacles in real time, the holy grail of the drone industry that so far, nobody has been able to really implement.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a
