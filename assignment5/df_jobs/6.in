VReport\u000aA crowdfunded startup explains why crowdfunding can be a complete disaster\u000aAfter more than two years and two million dollars, Lockitron says it's ready to deliver on its promise\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aLike so many ambitious young hardware startups these days, Lockitron used crowdfunding to sell people a product before they built it. The company promised users a keyless door lock that paired with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC, allowing customers to unlock it remotely or with a simple proximity sensor. Lockitron ran its own crowdfunding campaign and managed to collect more than $2.2 million in pre-orders for around 14,000 units; it aimed to start shipping in March of 2013. The success of that campaign and press attention on the company drove another 70,000 pre-orders through its website.\u000aFast forward to today and Lockitron has shipped just over 11,000 units, less than 14 percent of the orders it had taken over the past two-odd years. And while this early version of the device does work, it can be a struggle to set up, has fallen short on battery life, and is missing prominent features. More than a few customers found themselves locked out after the product malfunctioned. "Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs," says co-founder Cameron Robertson. In a survey sent out to customers, a question asked them to describe Lockitron in three words. "Beta, potential, unreliable," read one response.\u000a"Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs."\u000aIn August of last year the company realized it needed to start from scratch, and today Lockitron is announcing the results. It has a new manufacturing partner and a completely redesigned product,  called Bolt . "We made mistakes, we learned a lot, and now we are ready to deliver something that fulfills our ambition," says Robertson. The new unit is set to start shipping this March for $99, roughly one-third the cost of the original Lockitron.\u000aLockitron's struggles are symptomatic of challenges many young DIY hardware companies face. Crowdfunding, which seemed like the new face of innovation a couple years ago, has been humbled by the complex realities of mass production. The first big hurdle for the company, after the rush of receiving so many orders, was figuring out how to get them all built. "We didn't know the first thing about China, about how to find a good partner \u2014 someone with domain expertise building something like a lock with 41 discreet mechanical components, most of which were custom-made," says Robertson.\u000a"We didn't know the first thing about China."\u000aThe factory they settled on delivered working units, but couldn't keep pace with the promises the company had made around shipping. "We got caught in a low-volume production trap," says Robertson. "We had over 70,000 units on backorder, and they were producing a few hundred each week."\u000aLockitron had come out of the prestigious Y-Combinator startup program , but that certainly didn\u2019t guarantee success \u2014 they were able to build something that worked well for a demo and could endure testing in their lab, but they didn't have the capital to really field test something with the mechanical complexity of a lock. The complexities of testing were magnified by the fact that the product was expected to work in partnership with whatever lock customers already had on their door.\u000aThe Lockitron co-founders with their original hand-built prototype.\u000aLockitron ran  its own crowdfunding campaign , but unlike Kickstarter, they couldn't charge people for orders until they shipped. "We had $2.2 million in orders but none of that capital to work with, so we were super resource-constrained," says Robertson. The company used Amazon to take orders, but Amazon\u2019s policy is not to charge until an item ships. (Kickstarter also uses Amazon, but gets the money earlier by framing its transactions as "donations," not pre-orders.)\u000aHardware products from established companies often get years of testing in the wild, using multiple prototypes, before finally being offered for sale. "Most of what we showed off in the video worked, but under ideal circumstances," says Robertson. "We tested against a fairly big lock library, but nothing like the diversity of old, discontinued, and well-worn locks out in the real world."\u000a"In the real world people have a crappy router."\u000aThe same ideal conditions applied to things like battery testing. "In the real world people have a crappy router several hundred feet away with a few thick walls in between," says Robertson. "The Lockitron would struggle to stay connected, and that ended up being a big drain on battery."\u000aIt was the summer of 2013 when the company started changing course. It found a new manufacturing partner, one that specialized in locks. And it created a new device that replaced customers' existing locks entirely, instead of sitting on top, ensuring if it worked in testing, it would work on your door. Lockitron actually ran a survey of customers who had received the first unit. The overwhelming advice was to trim features and ship something that "just worked."\u000a"They're interested in trying out and helping new companies."\u000aOf the 70,000 people who ordered a Lockitron, about 10,000 have canceled their orders so far. Robertson says that the company has managed to help them keep the faith by being transparent about its struggles and communicating regularly about its progress. "Early on we started updating backers every two weeks like clockwork, and we're past 50 updates now. We send them out via email to all backers as well as post them to [ our blog ]," says Robertson. "They're early adopters, and they're interested in trying out and helping new companies that are working to create new categories of products."\u000aLockitron isn't taking any chances with over-promising this time. "We are telling customers, if you pre-ordered, you can be first in line for the Bolt. But be aware that the first batch will be a sort of pilot, and that after a few months with them in the field, we will produce a version two that addresses any big issues." Customers who backed the Lockitron may have waited a while, but Robertson says they are getting a more robust, functional, and affordable unit. "It\u2019s unfair to ask somebody to wait two to three years," he said. "But hopefully we\u2019re going to deliver them something of lasting value."\u000aVerge Video Archives: HandUp is like Kickstarter for the Homeless (Detours, Season 2)\u000a

V(Shot on location at WeWork . Also available on YouTube )\u000aApple's latest laptop is simply called the MacBook.\u000aActually, I suppose, you're going to see everybody refer to it as "the new MacBook" for a little while, but that's just temporary. The name is a signal. Apple could have called it the MacBook Air 12-inch or the MacBook Slim or any number of other things. But instead, it\u2019s the MacBook. That has to mean something.\u000aYou are really, really going to want this laptop, even though it's relatively expensive, starting at $1,299. It\u2019s easily the most impressive laptop I\u2019ve seen since the original MacBook Air. It\u2019s almost unbelievable in every regard. How did Apple make it so thin? What dark magicks make this trackpad work? Is it really going to be fast enough? Why is there only one port? Every one of those questions has an interesting answer, and the mere fact that a laptop can still engender this much intrigue in 2015 is remarkable.\u000aAfter using this tiny little wonder of a computer for a little over a week, I have a pretty strong guess about what the name means. It\u2019s called the MacBook because Apple sees it as the Platonic ideal of what a laptop should be. It\u2019s what Apple believes all laptops should eventually become.\u000aBut if you know anything about Platonic ideals, you know that there's a big difference between the ideal and the reality. And so the big question for this tiny new MacBook is simple: is the reality anywhere close to the ideal?\u000aThe MacBook is what happens when the iPad Air decides to up and grow a keyboard, hinge, and trackpad. It's a thin, compact, and light sliver of a machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines. The same precision we've seen on Apple's phones and tablets has been applied here \u2014 it's genuinely a level above any other laptop Apple has ever made, to say nothing of other hardware makers.\u000aIt is, in a word, beautiful.\u000aA thin machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines\u000aIt's almost impossibly thin, measuring just over 13mm at its thickest point. It's even more impossibly light, weighing just over two pounds. That's about a full pound less than the 13-inch MacBook Air and a third of a pound less than the 11-inch Air. And that weight is perfectly distributed across the deck of the laptop and the screen. It's so well-balanced that it feels lighter than it actually is.\u000aPeople who use the 11-inch Air are going to feel right at home, and actually people who use the 13-inch Air will, too. It just feels like the ideal size for a small laptop, perfectly fitted to a full-sized keyboard and not a whit bigger. Apple also redesigned the hinge so that it is made of metal, increased the size of the trackpad, and moved the speakers (which are reasonably loud, but obviously lack anything resembling bass) up above the keyboard.\u000aIn comes in gold, silver, and space gray. I got a gold review unit because, well, why not? I think it totally works. It's much more restrained in person than you might think, but honestly I'd probably end up choosing the space gray model.\u000aTo pull off this design, Apple's marketing video will tell you that it required a lot of inventions. The keyboard, trackpad, screen, and batteries all needed to be redone to make the MacBook as thin as it is. And in every one of those cases, you can safely believe the hype. But the flip side of invention is compromise, and unfortunately there's enough of that here that I have to leaven the enthusiasm I've been expressing thus far with a warning: it's not all wonderful. Invention and compromise.\u000aBut let's stick with the inventions for now, because they truly are remarkable. It starts with the keyboard, which is shallower than what you might be used to. Underneath each key is a butterfly mechanism, a "steel dome" that registers your keystrokes, and an individual backlight for every single key.\u000aAt first, I hated it. It felt weird to have each button move so little when I pressed down on it. But it didn't take long at all for me to change my mind. The combination of all those new parts meant that the essential friction and "clack" that make up any great keyboard is still here, just different than what I was used to. I can bang away on this thing or type more softly, and both feel completely satisfying. The only real hassles are the redesigned up and down arrow keys: they're entirely too small.\u000aThe next thing is the screen, a 236 ppi Retina display that's 2304 x 1440 pixels. The invention here is that it's thinner and brighter thanks to rearranged electronics inside, and it's also more energy efficient. The thinner screen also means that the Apple logo on the back of the laptop no longer lights up, if that's something you care about. But ignore those specs and just look at it: it simply puts the screen on the MacBook Air to shame.\u000aThe redesigned keyboard will grow on you\u000aIt's sharp and bright, and Apple also switched the bezels to black to match the rest of the Retina MacBook lineup. Those bezels are thin, too, so the combination makes the screen feel really big. You can set the resolution all the way up to 1440 x 900, so it's effectively giving you the same real estate as the 13-inch MacBook Air. You can\u2019t crank it up to the full resolution, but you wouldn\u2019t want to anyway, since it would make everything way too small.\u000aThe Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object. It has tiny pads that detect pressure, and then an electromagnet inside that simulates the feel of a click when you press down. So when the laptop is off, you feel nothing. When it's on, click. It's all in service of thinness \u2014 and some clever software features.\u000aYou can set the click strength in settings and also turn on a bunch of unique features for it in OS X. Force clicking (as it's called) lets you open up web page previews on links or definitions for words. You can also step through fast-forward speeds on videos and even feel some haptic feedback in a select few apps, like iMovie. Honestly, none of those software tricks felt very intuitive to me. But the trackpad itself felt completely natural, easily up to Apple's standards. In fact, it feels better than normal for a MacBook, since you can now click on the very top of it as easily as the bottom.\u000aThe Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object\u000aThere are other inventions, too. Apple redesigned its batteries to be tiered, so they can cram more of them into the MacBook. The result is a claimed nine hours of battery life \u2014 a claim that's notably close to my experience. In our relatively light test, which reloads websites once a minute, this MacBook actually beat Apple's claims by about an hour or so. But when you're putting it under stress, you'll get a bit less, probably closer to eight hours.\u000aBut here's where the inventions, while impressive, begin to feel more like those compromises. Apple created an all new, tiny little circuit board to house all the microchips that power the MacBook. It means that it doesn't need a fan at all, but it also means that using the kind of processor we're used to on modern laptops isn't really tenable.\u000aInstead, the processor on the MacBook is an Intel Core M, clocked at 1.1GHz but with a Turbo Boost mode that can crank it up to more than twice as fast (and there are other, more expensive variants that can go even faster). Hence the compromises: the MacBook benchmarks at about the same level as a four-year-old MacBook Air. That sounds dire, but in my experience it doesn't feel anywhere near that slow \u2014 mostly.\u000aFast enough for most common tasks, but it gets warm if you push it\u000aBasically, if you do anything that\u2019s going to really tax the processor, this laptop probably isn't going to cut it for you. In that sense it's actually kind of like a Chromebook. It's fast enough for 70 percent of what I do, but a little slower than what I'm used to. For about 20 percent of what I do \u2014 mostly photo editing \u2014 it works but requires patience. But it's the last 10 percent that's hard: video editing, really big iPhoto libraries, basically anything processor-intensive can get rough.\u000aI'll also say that the Chrome browser is kind of the perfect app to show where the line is between "good enough" and "kind of slow." Chrome has really become something of a resource hog for me lately. It\u2019s not a problem most of the time, but load up enough tabs, and any computer will start to chug. On my MacBook Air, that happens at around 20 tabs. On the new MacBook, it\u2019s about half that.\u000aSafari runs much better, but the point is that the headroom for apps that hog resources is much smaller than what I'm used to. And in any case, the fact that it's fanless means that the laptop gets warm. I wouldn't say hot, but it\u2019s definitely riding that line of comfort for bare legs. Fortunately, the heat is localized to where that processor cranking into turbo boost is located: on the bottom, near the back.\u000aThe tiny board, the fanless design, the fact that it can power this Retina display at all \u2014 all these inventions are impressive. But being impressed and being able to get work done are not the same thing. It's a compromise I can't promise you is okay unless you're sure you're not going to push a machine beyond the basics and can stand to wait for those times when you need to.\u000aWhich leads me to the last invention / compromise: the new MacBook has a new port, called USB Type-C. It's also the only port besides the headphone jack. You use it for power and for connecting your phone, monitor, printer, camera, or whatever else you might have. And because it's a brand new kind of plug, you will need adapters for all of those things.\u000aSay you want to charge your computer, plug in your iPhone, and plug in an external monitor. That's a totally natural thing to want to do! To pull it off, you are going to need to have the right dongle \u2014 and you\u2019re going to need to buy it, too, since they don\u2019t come in the box. They're just beginning to come on the market now, and I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll be both cheap and plentiful, but so far I've only been able to use the basic ones. So, just by way of example, right now I can't plug my Apple MacBook into my Apple Cinema Display because I don\u2019t have a dongle with Display Port on it.\u000aAgain, this is an invention and a compromise, and it's one that I'm actually a little torn on. USB Type-C has a legitimate chance of being the One Connector To Rule Them All. Google and Nokia are already using it, other phone and laptop manufacturers are on board, and from a technical standpoint it's a really great plug. It's strong, it\u2019s reversible, it's fast from both a data and power perspective, and it's not proprietary. I charged the new MacBook with Google's power adapter. Heck, I charged the new MacBook off one of those battery bricks that's meant to power an iPad.\u000aSure, I miss the safety of the MagSafe adapter, but being able to buy any number of chargers and adapters from whomever makes the cheapest or best ones is a big deal \u2014 and worth the tradeoff. Or will be, once USB Type-C takes hold.\u000aApple says that it designed the MacBook with the idea that soon you'll be able to connect everything wirelessly anyway. The iPhone can sync wirelessly or use AirDrop, lots of cameras support Wi-Fi, etc, etc. That all sounds nice, but I can tell you from painful experience that the dream of wireless peripherals is usually more like a waking nightmare of confusing sync settings, delays, and frustration. The MacBook supports Bluetooth 4.0 and an alphabet of Wi-Fi standards, but that's not enough, not yet.\u000aTalking to other Verge staffers about it, I joked that I'm looking forward to "Livin' La Vida Dongle." That's almost true! When it comes down to it, I mostly plug in power and only rarely need to use an SD card reader or plug in some other USB device. But when I need it, I need it, and having to carry a rat's nest of adapters and cables puts a huge damper on the portability of this machine.\u000aA lot of people remember the moment when Steve Jobs pulled the original MacBook Air out of that interoffice memo envelope. It was jaw-dropping. But it's easy to forget that the very first MacBook Air had problems \u2014 some of the very same problems as this new MacBook: not enough ports, slow, expensive. But the next version became the MacBook Air you know now, the one everybody either uses or copies. The one that changed laptops for five years.\u000aThis new MacBook is the future. All laptops are going to be like this someday: with ridiculously good screens, no fans, lasting all day. Just like the original MacBook Air defined a generation of competitors, this new MacBook will do the same. It, or something inspired by it, is what you'll be using in two or three years. It's that good.\u000aAll laptops are going to be like this someday\u000aHere's a crazy surprise I didn't expect: my 13-inch MacBook Air felt big and clunky after I went back to it. And make no mistake, the MacBook Air is itself a wonder of engineering. Yet compared to the new MacBook it felt like a heavy, kind of ugly throwback with a mediocre screen. I really didn't want to go back to that Air.\u000aBut I still went back.\u000aYou see, the problem with the future is that it isn't here yet. Instead we live in the now, and the now doesn't have the ecosystem of adapters and wireless peripherals I need to use this laptop with its single port. The now doesn't have the right processor to power through the apps I need without ruining battery life. And right now, this laptop is far from cheap at $1,299.\u000aBut if history is any guide, all of those problems will go away \u2014 and more quickly than you probably expect. When they do, I'll be using this MacBook. The MacBook. Hurry up, future. Hurry the hell up.\u000aPhotography by Sean O'Kane\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIn the nascent world of wearables, there have been two camps. The fitness trackers, like a Fitbit or a Jawbone, and the smartwatches, like Android Wear and the Apple Watch . The common thinking has been that these two camps will soon converge, and there\u2019s been a lot of evidence that such a future is not far off. Fitness tracking is a big component of the Apple Watch and a number of Android Wear devices, and Fitbit\u2019s latest models have a lot of smartwatch capabilities to augment their fitness tracking.\u000aYet while many smartwatches have fitness tracking and many fitness trackers have smartwatch features, both options demand compromises. You either choose between great fitness-tracking features or smartwatch productivity. Alcatel\u2019s new Onetouch Watch, a $149.99 wrist-worn wearable shipping this month, is just the latest device trying to be both.\u000aAfter wearing the Onetouch Watch for the past week, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not a great smartwatch, nor is it a great fitness tracker. Instead, it asks a different compromise: are you willing to give up the best in either category for something that\u2019s cheaper than most smartwatches and better looking than most fitness trackers?\u000aAt first glance, the Onetouch Watch belongs in the smartwatch camp. With its round face, metal body, and color display, it\u2019s easy to compare it to Motorola\u2019s Moto 360. But while the Moto 360 is a full Android Wear-powered smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch runs on a proprietary platform that works with both Android and iOS devices. Aside from the cross-platform benefit, the Onetouch Watch is slimmer, cheaper, and lasts longer between charges than most other smartwatches.\u000aAesthetically, the Onetouch Watch is considerably nicer than many other wearables, especially in this price range. It\u2019s round, much like a traditional watch, isn\u2019t as thick as most Android Wear devices, and has a design that can work with a wide variety of outfits or personal styles. It doesn\u2019t look like a computer on my wrist nor does it attempt to make a fashion statement like the Apple Watch \u2014 to most people, I\u2019m just wearing a generic digital watch.\u000aAt the center of the round face is a 1.22-inch color touchscreen with 240 x 204 pixel resolution. It\u2019s not a full circle \u2014 there\u2019s a flat area at the bottom just like on the Moto 360 \u2014 and you can certainly see pixels, but it\u2019s bright and vibrant with great viewing angles. It\u2019s easily visible outdoors, which isn\u2019t something I can say for a lot of smartwatches with color screens. Most of the time the Watch\u2019s display is off \u2014 you wake it up by pressing the button on the side or raising your arm as if to check the time. The gesture actually works with less lag than I expected, but I still prefer a watch that lets me check the time without moving my arm.\u000aCharging the Onetouch Watch doesn't require clumsy adapters \u2014 just plug it into a USB port\u000aThe Onetouch Watch has a fixed rubber strap that\u2019s flexible and comfortable to wear all day. It comes in two colors \u2014 white or black  \u2014 but it isn\u2019t interchangeable, so you\u2019re stuck with whichever one you pick from the outset. The fixed band does have a couple of key advantages: there\u2019s an NFC chip inside the band for quick pairing and a built-in USB plug for charging. The USB plug at the end of the strap might be the smartest part of the Watch\u2019s design: you can plug into any USB port to recharge the watch, no clumsy adapters needed.\u000aTapping the screen launches a basic grid for the various built-in apps on the Watch. There\u2019s a simple weather app, compass, music controller, phone locator, and an app to remotely take pictures with your phone\u2019s camera. There\u2019s also the fitness-tracking apps, which can count steps, track distance traveled, track your sleep, and measure your heart rate.\u000aThere are three basic watch face designs (two analog, one digital), and you can customize the colors and background of the watch face. You access notifications by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, which is a bit clumsy and not too easy to do when you\u2019re on the go. The flat area at the bottom of the display also acts as a back button to navigate through the hierarchy of the interface.\u000aNotifications are where the Onetouch Watch fails as a smartwatch\u000aNotifications on the Onetouch Watch are where its smartwatch leanings start to fall apart. Like any other smartwatch, it\u2019s convenient to get buzzes on your wrist when something or someone is trying to get your attention. But the Watch\u2019s display does not light up automatically when notifications come in, nor does the notification drawer pop up by itself, requiring me to touch the watch with my other hand to see what just made it buzz. The Watch only lets me read the notification \u2014 there\u2019s no clearing it or acting upon it from my wrist. Further, the Watch only supports notifications from select apps (calls, messages, email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Google+, Google Hangouts, and Gmail), so there was no way to configure it to see alerts from my email app of choice ( Outlook ) or get alerts from Google Now. Alcatel tells me that it will add support for more app notifications in the future, but it will be relying on feedback from users for what apps to add.\u000aThe other smartwatch things you might look for \u2014 third-party apps, custom watch faces, and voice control \u2014 aren\u2019t available on the Onetouch Watch. With its limited support for notifications and lack of these extra features, it\u2019s better to think of this as a fitness device with some smartwatch features rather than a smartwatch with fitness features.\u000aSo how does it fare as a fitness device? Fine enough for what it is, but what it is turns out to be pretty limited. I\u2019ll start with the good parts. The companion app for iOS and Android lets you view your activity and set goals with an informative and attractive dashboard. Thankfully, the Watch\u2019s step counting isn\u2019t as wildly inaccurate as other trackers I\u2019ve worn. The  heart rate monitoring may be slow, but it\u2019s consistent and about as accurate as any other wrist-worn monitor I\u2019ve tried. I could easily see someone choosing to wear the Onetouch Watch just because it\u2019s a decent-looking device that counts their steps. (This is also the entire appeal of the Withings Activité line .)\u000aFitness tracking is accurate, but there's a lot of room for improvement\u000aYet as much as I like the fitness tracking, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement. I can set my goals and see charts of my activity in the companion app, but unless I\u2019m consciously checking my progress throughout the day, the watch doesn\u2019t actively encourage me to get up and work toward hitting my goals. The data captured by the watch doesn\u2019t sync with Apple\u2019s Health app, Google\u2019s Fit platform, or any other service, trapping it within Alcatel\u2019s system. That\u2019s actually a huge disappointment, because most fitness trackers at this price give you the added benefit of participating in some kind of ecosystem. Either you can compare your scores with friends or at least get plugged into either Android or Apple\u2019s built-in system for fitness. There\u2019s also a sleep-tracking system on Alcatel\u2019s watch, but it\u2019s not automatic, so I need to start it each night and stop it when I wake up.\u000aSo why would you want to accept all these limitations? Well, for one, you might just like the traditional, no-nonsense look of the watch. For another, the Onetouch Watch outlasts all other smartwatches with color displays when it comes to battery life. I\u2019ve been able to get a full two days between charges with it, and even more if I take it off at night and forget about the (questionably useful) sleep tracking. Combine that with the super convenient built-in USB port on the strap, and the Watch is one of the least annoying wearables you can buy when it comes to battery life and charging.\u000aThe Onetouch Watch embodies the split between smartwatches and fitness trackers, and it\u2019s emblematic of what is about to be a deluge of also-ran wearables. It\u2019s a fitness tracker posing as a smartwatch, but it doesn\u2019t do as well as the best options in either category.\u000aIf you want a fitness tracker that looks more like a traditional watch than a sport band, the Onetouch Watch is more appealing than a Fitbit or a Jawbone. It\u2019s attractive, lasts long enough between charges, has reliable and accurate step and activity tracking, and is less expensive than similarly equipped devices. The downside is that your data is trapped inside Alcatel\u2019s ecosystem instead of a more open or useful platform.\u000aA fitness tracker posing as a smartwatch\u000aBut as a smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to useful notifications on your wrist. It also doesn\u2019t have the expandability of Pebble, Apple Watch, or Android Wear through third-party apps. The Onetouch Watch is cheap, and it looks good, but that\u2019s where its appeal ends as a smartwatch.\u000aIt\u2019s an in-between wearable device that doesn\u2019t have the platform support of Apple or Google, nor the fitness tracking chops of Fitbit, Jawbone, and the like. You\u2019re going to see a lot of devices like this on the shelves at Best Buy, because it turns out that making a basic smartwatch and making a basic fitness tracker is getting to be pretty easy. But making something that does both well? That\u2019s really hard.\u000a

For brief periods, I'd manage to find both the motivation and time in my schedule, only to fall off the wagon when my days got too busy.\u000aBut then I discovered that many top athletes exercise 20 minutes or less each workout . It turns out many of the benefits from exercise come from a precious few seconds of exhaustion, which triggers the body to build muscle in preparation for future strenuous activity.\u000aA clever group of fitness researchers at the Human Performance Institute designed a circuit training routine that brings exhaustion to most major muscle groups in 7 minutes flat.  The published results of the so-called "Scientific 7-minute workout" went viral: now, even  the New York Times and the Pebble smartwatch have apps for users eager for a convenient way to incorporate it into their routines.\u000aThe key to high-intensity burst workouts is to strike that delicate balance between collapse-to-the-floor exhaustion and a pleasant sweat. If I train too easy, my body won't think it needs to make physiological improvements; If I work too hard in the beginning, I won't be able to finish all of the movements.\u000aThe key to exercising quickly is to get your heart rate right\u000a"In my opinion, and broadly speaking, exercise intensity must be relatively high in order to gain cardiovascular conditioning from brief, interval style workouts," Martin Gibola, a short exercise-enthusiast and McMaster's Professor, wrote in an email. "That is essentially the trade-off for the reduced time commitment involved. While there is no hard and fast rule, average heart rate during the intervals should be at least ~80-85 percent of maximum."\u000aThis is where technology plays a vital role: training at the very specific 80 percent of maximum heart rate is difficult to do. (Maximum heart rate is more obvious, at least for anyone who's ever run until their knees buckled.) If I rely on solely on my intuition, the incentive to take it easy overrides my sense of intensity.\u000aGetting accurate data is important, but carrying a professional grade chest strap everywhere is a real pain in the neck. Fortunately, two new wearables,  the Basis Peak and  the Microsoft Band , promise to track my heart rate in real time.\u000aPreviously, popular health trackers only did resting heart rate (sub-130 bpm). The only non-chest strap alternative was the Mio Alpha watch \u2014 but it wasn't meant to be worn all day, so I still had to remember to carry some extra device on me.\u000aTo test out how well each of the new 24/7 wearables could handle short-burst workouts, I wore 4 devices during my workout and checked my heart rate during each minute. The baseline is the chest strap: the closer each gets to a Polar H7, a professional-grade device, the more accurate.\u000aThe workout\u000aThe scientific 7-minute workout is twelve exercises, thirty seconds each, ten seconds of rest between: jumping jacks, wall sit, pushups, crunches, step-up onto chair, squats, tricep dips on chair, plank hold, high-knee runs, lunges, pushup one-handed hold, side plank. (Since it was designed for beginners, I increased the intensity of each workout to include a jump.)\u000aMinute One, Jumping jacks: I feel like I could do this forever, and begin seriously question whether the 7-minute "workout" is even doing anything for me. I look down at my watch, and see only 144 beats per minute (and I should be at least 160). I crank jumping jacks into high gear to spike my heart rate.\u000aMinute two, jumping push-ups: I finally hit 167 bpm and am feeling a good stride. Now it feels like a workout! I bang through a dozen pushups without a rest. I got this.\u000aMinute three, jumping on onto chair: my optimism fades as I barely squeak through without stopping to rest. My effort slightly dips to 165 bpm; it's already noticeably harder to sustain the same level of effort.\u000aMinute four, tricep chair dips: I hit my runners\u2019 high. Embracing the pain, I burn through dips as fast as gravity will allow. 172 bpm. Did I overdo it? Eh, probably not.\u000aMinute 5, stationary high knee running: I definitely over did. Why did I over do it!? I get through half the 30-second sprint before slowing to a crawl. Thankfully, I'm at 170 bpm and realize I can slow down a bit as I edge toward the finish.\u000aMinute 6, jumping lunges: I get a second runners high, fueled by nothing but the optimism that I'm going to make through. I clock in at 173 dpm. I'm way overdoing it; I don't care. I will beat this damn workout! I will own it!\u000aMinute 7, holding one-arm side plank: I realize how long seven minutes of pain can seem. I push as hard as I can to maintain good form, barely holding myself up from falling. As the time buzzes, I collapse to the ground. I made it.\u000aIt is here, on the floor, covered in sweat, that I realize 7 minutes can, indeed, be workout. My heart rate proves that.\u000aThroughout the workout, the Microsoft Band was consistently closest to the chest strap, though it did occasionally vary in a big way. And not only does it record exercise-grade heart rate with impressive accuracy, it also has a function to automatically count reps. I could program my own version of the 7-minute workout and know whether I was improving over time, by seeing if I could perform more reps during each workout in the future. As such, it it now my default fitness band.\u000aPolar chest strap\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aMicrosoft\u2019s Windows team likes ninja cats and fire-breathing unicorns if this laptop sticker is anything to go by. I first heard about the existence of this laptop sticker shortly before the first Windows 10 event in September, and I\u2019ve been trying to track it down ever since. The stickers magically appeared on Microsoft's campus, and Windows team members have snapped them up and some use them on their laptops. It\u2019s the perfect example of a company with a bit of personality, and something you rarely see from a corporate giant like Microsoft. The software maker even has a Windows t-shirt it's handing out at Mobile World Congress this week that mocks the lack of Windows 9 (see below).\u000aExcel keyboards on Android are cool, and  great iOS email apps or crazy  HoloLens headsets are even cooler, but this laptop sticker is the definition of cool. I mean, just look at it. It\u2019s a ninja cat riding a fire-breathing unicorn, all while waving a Windows flag.  It might be lacking a rainbow, lasers shooting from the unicorn\u2019s eyes, and nyan cat running away from a Minecraft world, but it\u2019s still cool. It\u2019s official, Microsoft really is cool again.\u000aSaw this Windows t-shirt at the Microsoft booth today. Check out Windows 9 pic.twitter.com/H4jmi8hPfa\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aFollowing hard on the heels of its  $60 million deal with Genentech , personal genetics startup 23andMe has announced an agreement to  share its user data and research platform with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Although 23andMe is still languishing under  FDA restrictions (the company is only permitted to offer ancestry reports and raw genetic data to customers \u2014 not medical analysis), its well-organized database of some 640,000 genotyped individuals is proving popular with the medical industry.\u000a"The largest data set of its kind."\u000aIn a  press statement announcing the deal, 23andMe spelled out the attractions of its genetic resources: "Researchers can now fully benefit from the largest dataset of its kind, running queries in minutes across more than 1,000 different diseases, conditions, and traits. With this information researchers can identify new associations between genes and diseases and traits more quickly than ever before." The two companies will also collaborate on "genome-wide association studies, surveys, and clinical trial recruitment" starting with a 5,000-person study into lupus.\u000aThe genetic information in 23andMe's database is anonymized and voluntary. Customers who bought 23andMe's $99 saliva test kits are given the option to share their data for this sort of research \u2014 although it's likely that some individuals will still be uneasy that their genetic information is going to multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, for 23andMe, this data is a crucial product, not just in terms of revenue (the value of this latest deal with Pfizer has not been disclosed) but in bolstering its reputation as a serious player in the world of medical research.\u000a

VAlmost every single Xbox executive we profiled in this video last year has left the company\u000aTold you TV was a bad idea\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aBoyd Multerer \u2014 the genius Microsoft engineer who founded Xbox Live, helped build the Xbox 360, and led the development of the three-operating-systems-in-one Xbox One platform \u2014 announced on Twitter today that he's left Microsoft to pursue new opportunities. Multerer has been on leave since the Xbox One launched; he and his wife Keri launched  the interactive erotica site Silkwords back in February, and now he says he's focusing on other new startup ideas.\u000aGoodbye Microsoft. It was a good run. Xbox was Great! Time to do something new.\u000a\u2014 Boyd Multerer (@BoydMulterer) December 29, 2014\u000aBut more importantly, Multerer's departure means that almost every single person on the Xbox One team we profiled last November when that console launched has now either left the company or been reassigned under new Xbox chief Phil Spencer. Microsoft's original vision of the Xbox One as a general-purpose living room platform has been drastically scaled back \u2014 Spencer is a games guy. That focus on games is paying off, as  the Xbox One just outsold the PS4 for the first time in November . But all the people who were trying to build something bigger? Well, they're gone. Just go down the list of the people in this feature video we made \u2014 a video focused on Xbox TV:\u000aMarc Whitten, former Xbox VP, is now the Chief Product Officer at Sonos. Whitten was the biggest champion of the Xbox One as a TV platform; he and I argued about the TV integration many, many times.\u000aBen Smith, the Xbox TV program manager, is also at Sonos now.\u000aMulterer, who was in charge of the platform that enabled the Xbox One to both play games and run Windows apps, has now left.\u000aKareem Choudhry, who was in charge of Kinect development, is now director of development for all of Xbox. Kinect is how the Xbox One controls cable boxes over IR, but it's no longer bundled with the console and few games support it. And  Phil Spencer seems pretty happy the Kinect is dead .\u000aThe only person we profiled who has the same role is Jeff Henshaw, who remains Xbox group program manager. That's a big turnover \u2014 and an even bigger change of vision for Microsoft's next-generation console after former Xbox chief Don Mattrick left to become CEO of Zynga.\u000aIR blasters remain a terrible idea\u000aThe Xbox One was supposed to be the first step towards a living room revolution \u2014 it was supposed to run Windows apps, every console was supposed to be a dev unit, and deep interactive TV integration was the next big step \u2014 but there's been virtually no progress on any of those fronts since the console's bumpy launch, and the people who championed that vision are now mostly gone. The renewed focus on gaming has led to short-term sales success, but consoles last a decade, and the long-term vision is no longer clear. Microsoft says the Xbox One will run the upcoming Windows 10 operating system, which is supposed to unify the company's various products, but there have been precious few details about that plan so far. We'll have to wait to find out more.\u000aOne thing is clear, however: if your product depends on a damn IR blaster to work, it is definitely doomed to fail.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSay the word \u201cChromebook,\u201d and the image that comes to mind for most people is a small, cheap, basic computer. That\u2019s exactly what most Chromebooks are. The best Chromebooks you can buy have 11- or 12-inch displays, are priced well under $400, and do basic web browsing and not much more.\u000aBut the reality of the matter is that most people looking for a cheap laptop don\u2019t want an 11- or 12-inch model. The vast majority of computers purchased in the $400\u2013$600 range have big 15.6-inch displays. And they run Windows. Even though Chromebooks have long been billed as the computers for \u201ceverybody,\u201d they haven\u2019t been the computers for most people .\u000aThat\u2019s starting to change, however, as Google\u2019s Chromebook partners are beginning to embrace the larger Chromebook. Last year, one of the most popular models on the market was HP\u2019s Chromebook 14 , an arguably terrible option with poor build quality and a lousy display whose only saving grace was that it was big. Now Acer is launching the Chromebook 15, the first Chromebook with an even bigger 15.6-inch display. It goes right for the heart of the cheap Windows laptop market: the giant hulks of laptops priced around $400\u2013$500 that fill Best Buy and Walmart\u2019s shelves.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 actually starts at $249, a significantly lower price than most Windows laptops. But that rock bottom price comes with a low-res 1366 x 768 pixel display, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. For the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve been using the $349.99 model, which steps up to a 1080p display, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. It\u2019s powered by a dual-core Intel Celeron processor \u2014 a real laptop chip, as opposed to the lower-power mobile processors used in other Chromebooks. I strongly recommend ponying up for the more expensive model; the increased screen resolution and added RAM make for a much better experience. And even with those upgrades, the Chromebook 15 still falls under the price of the average entry level Windows notebook.\u000aThe Chromebook 15's most defining feature is its most obvious\u000aThe Chromebook 15\u2019s most defining feature is its most obvious: it\u2019s big! In fact, it\u2019s bigger than the 15-inch MacBook Pro I use as my daily workhorse. It\u2019s kind of clunky, kind of chunky, pretty ugly, and the white textured finish on my review unit doesn\u2019t do any favors to hide its bulky dimensions. (Acer is also selling a black model, which is definitely more pleasing on the eyes.) That makes it difficult to use on the go: it barely fit on my lap during my commute on the train to the office, and forget about fitting this thing on the seatback tray of an economy seat on an airplane. The all-plastic Chromebook 15 also weighs nearly five pounds, which is practically an anvil in the Chromebook world and is even heavier than my aluminum MacBook Pro.\u000aBut none of those things really matter if your computer sits on a desk for the majority of its life. Instead, the big dimensions of the Chromebook 15 prove to be an asset here: the screen is 27 percent larger than a 13.3-inch Chromebook, the keyboard is full-sized and spacious, the trackpad is the biggest you can get on a Chromebook, and there are two big, loud speakers on the deck that pump tunes straight up, instead of to the side or off of another surface. It doesn\u2019t skimp on ports or connectivity either: there\u2019s a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port, a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, and support for 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks. For someone that\u2019s going to buy a basic computer for simple tasks and leave it on a desk the vast majority of the time, those are all attractive features.\u000aThe 1080p display won\u2019t impress anyone used to the color-rich, high-res panels on MacBook Pros or high-end Windows ultrabooks. But it\u2019s adequately bright, has acceptable viewing angles, and has a matte finish with virtually no glare, which is really easy on the eyes. It also doesn\u2019t suffer from the graininess or harsh colors often seen on other Chromebooks. Aziz Ansari\u2019s latest Netflix special didn\u2019t look great \u2014 his black suit and the dark backgrounds on the stage were various shades of dark grey instead of black \u2014 but the jokes were no less funny on the Chromebook 15 than they were when I watched it on my plasma TV. The extra screen real estate afforded by the 1080p resolution also lets me put two browser windows side by side, proving that you can actually multitask with a Chromebook. It lacks a touchscreen, but Chrome OS\u2019 support for touch is still nascent, and I don\u2019t miss having one.\u000aThe chiclet keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on, as opposed to the slippery and noisy keyboards on other Chromebooks I\u2019ve used. Its travel is shallower than my MacBook Pro\u2019s, which isn\u2019t much of a surprise, but it isn\u2019t fatiguing to use. The only thing it\u2019s missing is backlighting, but you\u2019ll have to step up to the thousand-dollar Chromebook Pixel to get that on a Chrome OS computer.\u000aThe trackpad is far better than what you expect from a $350 computer\u000aLike the keyboard, the spacious trackpad is actually a joy to use. For some reason (Google says it\u2019s thanks to the Pixel), Chromebooks have been racing ahead of their Windows counterparts in trackpad performance, and the Chromebook 15\u2019s trackpad is fast, responsive, and arguably the best trackpad you\u2019ll find on a computer in this price range. It\u2019s got just the right amount of friction to make multi-touch gestures like two-finger scrolling work effortlessly, and it never caused my cursor to jump around erratically. Its low-cost roots are betrayed by the cheap clacking sound it makes when you depress it, but that didn\u2019t hinder its functionality in any meaningful way. To beat this trackpad, you pretty much have to step up to a MacBook Air (or the aforementioned Chromebook Pixel). It\u2019s that good.\u000aThe worst part of most cheap computers is their laggy, slow performance when you\u2019re just trying to check Facebook or pay a bill. A lot of Windows laptops and a number of other Chromebooks (especially models with fanless, mobile processors) are frustrating in this regard. The Chromebook 15 doesn\u2019t have this problem: as I\u2019m typing this review, I have 22 tabs open across two windows, plus another window running the Sunrise calendar Chrome app, and it\u2019s not breaking a sweat \u2014 the fans aren\u2019t even on. It\u2019s actually disheartening to say that Chrome OS on this $350 computer runs as well as the Chrome browser does on my $2,500 MacBook Pro, but performance has not been an issue the entire time I\u2019ve been using the Chromebook 15. (It also demonstrates how badly Chrome runs on OS X, but that\u2019s a complaint for another time.) Pages load quickly, scrolling is smooth even on resource-heavy sites like ESPN\u2019s front page, and there\u2019s no lag when moving windows or tabs around. Chrome OS is still mostly just a browser, but it sure feels like more than that when I think of all the things I\u2019ve been able to get done on the Chromebook 15.\u000aIt\u2019s obvious that the Chromebook 15\u2019s main purpose is to sit on a desk and stay there, but if you do need to move it around and work unplugged, the battery life is actually pretty great. It lasted 11 hours and 32 minutes on our rundown test \u2014 significantly more than the 9 hours that Acer claims. In real-world use, it consistently goes for 7 to 8 hours between charges, which is well above the usual 3 to 4 hours you get from entry level Windows laptops.\u000aFor years, I\u2019ve been recommending Chromebooks to people looking for a simple, inexpensive computer to do day-to-day tasks, only to be shut down when I suggest a model with an 11- or 12-inch display. There are other reasons stopping people from picking up Chromebooks: networked printer support is abysmal, and if you have a large library of music, the tiny SSDs and 100GB of Google Drive storage aren\u2019t going to get it done. But the Chromebook 15 addresses the number one roadblock for most people: screen size. It also offers many of the features that make other Chromebooks so desirable: fast, simple operation, a great trackpad, and a low sticker price.\u000aI rely too much on desktop apps to make the Chromebook 15 my main computer, but for a lot of people looking for an inexpensive machine to pay the bills, do the occasional video call, and browse Facebook, it\u2019s more than sufficient. And it has the big screen that so many of them are looking for.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is the exact opposite of Apple's new MacBook\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is pretty much the exact opposite of Apple\u2019s new MacBook or Google\u2019s new Chromebook Pixel: it\u2019s big, chunky, has more than one port, and is pretty ugly to boot. It\u2019s also about a quarter of the price. But if the MacBook and the Pixel \u2014 expensive, technological tours de force with golden and aluminum finishes \u2014 represent the future of laptop computers, the Chromebook 15 represents the computer of today. It\u2019s the laptop for the average person that values price over design or portability, but also doesn\u2019t want to put up with the lousy, frustrating experience so often associated with cheap computers.\u000aIt may sound counterintuitive, especially if you focus on the bleeding edge of laptop technology, but the biggest Chromebook yet arguably had a real chance of becoming a success in the mass-market, entry-level laptop world. It\u2019s not the computer for people who work all day on a laptop, or for people who are constantly on the road. But for a lot of other people, the Chromebook 15 offers the size they are looking for without the headaches of entry-level Windows computers. There\u2019s your revolution.\u000aPhotography by Sean O'Kane\u000a

V13 products from last year's Consumer Electronics Show that went nowhere\u000aEnter the world of vapor\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Consumer Electronics Show is an entire week dedicated to the not-too-distant future. Companies are taking the covers off remarkable feats of technology that they\u2019ve been working on for months or years with the promise that you\u2019ll actually be able to buy them at some point in the course of the year.\u000aBut it\u2019s hard to predict the future. A lot can change in the span of 12 months, not just for a company, but for an entire product category. Things that once showed promise are often killed off before they even hit store shelves. Something can be on track, but a part isn\u2019t quite right, or a better idea springs along mid-development. Other times, companies simply realize they\u2019ve bitten off more than they can chew and decide to kill off a project mid-run.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThis past year\u2019s show is no exception to that rule. 3,200 exhibitors showed off their wares. Not all of what they presented was new, of course, but many showed off products, services, and ideas with the promise we\u2019d be seeing them in stores in time for a holiday season that\u2019s come and gone. We\u2019ve gone back through the list from last January to check in on some of the most interesting things that were destined to arrive, but never did.\u000aAsus Transformer Book Duet\u000aWhy pick an operating system for a tablet when you could run two instead? And why have just a laptop or a tablet, and not both at the same time? Asus\u2019 Transformer Book Duet answered both these questions with a design that would let you swap between Android and Windows, and back and forth between a tablet and a computer. Everything looked on track for the device, until it was cancelled following reported pressure from Google and Microsoft .\u000aVapor Corp. biometric vaporizer\u000aThe unfortunately named Vapor Corp. is the maker of real vaping products, but one of them disappeared in a cloud of its own vapor. The company\u2019s biometric vaporizer promised an additional measure of safety for those who like to leave their vape pens laying around the house. A biometric sensor wouldn\u2019t activate the device unless you were the one using it, making it safer around children. The company says it\u2019s still developing the technology, and plans to have a working prototype in a few weeks\u2019 time.\u000aVerge Video Archives: This Is What Vape Hacking Looks Like\u000aRazer Project Christine\u000aRazer\u2019s Project Christine is a plug-and-play computer with components that could be slotted into a rack like video game cartridges. Want a fast CPU? Just plug it into the rack; no screwdrivers or know-how required. Razer pitched this as a concept and not a product that was ready to go, but the company\u2019s aim was to bring it to market sometime in 2014. Instead, Razer reportedly had issues finding any companies that wanted to actually manufacture it. Not that we should count Razer out, though: the company made some pretty drastic changes to its handheld gaming system, the Edge , in the year between its introduction at CES in 2012 and its commercial release a year later.\u000aArchos smartwatches\u000aArchos introduced a trio of Pebble-like smartwatches at CES, with a launch planned sometime in summer. One included a black-and-white screen, another with a color touchscreen, and a third \u2014 the most interesting of the bunch \u2014 with an E Ink touchscreen. All aimed to beam smartphone notifications and simple apps onto the wrist. Archos\u2019 timing was bad, though, with Google\u2019s Android Wear debuting just two months later .\u000aScanadu Scout\u000aScanadu\u2019s Scout promised what was basically a medical tricorder from Star Trek, a small device that was able to scan your vitals and send that information over to your smartphone over Bluetooth. To be completely fair, the project was launched in late 2012, and went on to break Indiegogo\u2019s crowdfunding records. But the first prototype of the device was shown off at CES a year ago. The company originally planned to give backers an early version in March, but that was delayed after issues with both the hardware and software algorithms. Now the company\u2019s goal is to deliver more than 8,000 of the devices to campaign backers sometime this month.\u000aBliq light\u000aDo you remember when Phillips made a splash with its Hue bulbs in 2012? This past January came Bliq , a decorative light that would also let you change its colors with your phone, or pop with a different color if you got a notification. The big difference is that Hue could go in standard sockets and be used just like any other light, whereas Bliq was meant to be something for your coffee table, or bookshelf. It ended up on neither.\u000aTrewgrip keyboard\u000aThis very unusual keyboard debuted at CES , and is half-phone dock, half-keyboard. You type on keys that are on the back of the slab, which is where your fingers would naturally be. The whole thing is curved, kind of like an archery bow, and requires memorizing where those keys are on the back. The company says the learning curve for using it was somewhere between 8-10 hours. The keyboard was originally set to be available available in the second half of this year, but is now being pre-sold with a promised "spring 2015" availability.\u000aCanopy Sensus case\u000aCanopy, a small company based out of Minneapolis, designed the Sensus case so that you could touch the back of your phone, as well as the front. It actually debuted the idea at CES in 2013, but came back at last year\u2019s show with another pre-production version that could measure different levels of force and that supported newer iPhone models. The company ceased development on the case in June.\u000aLifelogger camera\u000aLifelogger\u2019s camera system pitched itself as "the ultimate life logging system," one that was capable of storing moments it recorded with a Google Glass-like camera, and making them easily accessible. Think Evernote , but for your eyeballs. In a notice in August, the company said that developing the camera has become "a big challenge since we are making it extremely small while still offering all the options," and that it\u2019s also focusing on making a platform for other camera makers to use its software. Its latest dispatch said the goal was to get the hardware into production sometime in the next few months, but also that it\u2019s showing off yet another prototype at this year\u2019s show.\u000aGlassup headset\u000aThis Google Glass-like gadget was unveiled in prototype form back in January, with the intention of launching this summer for a very palatable $399 (Google\u2019s beta version of Glass costs more than three times that). Unlike Glass, GlassUp displayed heads up information on a lens right in front of you, instead of off to the side. A failed Indiegogo campaign put a damper on that, suggesting there was a relatively low interest in the product. The latest message from the company was back in August , with a Glassup team member saying it had been a challenge to find the right materials and components, but that it had identified suppliers to make the headwear, and was still looking for a distributor.\u000aFinsix Dart charger\u000aFinsix's Dart promised to upend the world of notebook chargers with something that was four times smaller than most wall adapters, and six times lighter. Those were big claims, and enough to help the company raise more than $500,000 in crowdfunding. Unfortunately, the company kept those backers in the dark for most of the year, and has pushed ship dates for those early buyers back into this June.\u000aGeonaute 360 camera\u000aThe Geonaute 360 camera is like a GoPro, but records what\u2019s happening in three other directions, at once. You can register to buy it, but there\u2019s no estimate for when that is. Its demo last year was impressive though, offering a tantalizing vision of what video could look like inside of VR headsets.\u000aTwelve24 E ink clock\u000aE ink is cool on E readers, watches, and smartphones, but what about on a giant $499 wall clock? That\u2019s the goal of the Twelve24 E Ink clock , which could run a full year on just a watch battery, and was set to launch sometime last year. Now you can sign up to find out when you can preorder it.\u000aVerge Video Archives: Farewell CES 2014 (Supercut)\u000a
