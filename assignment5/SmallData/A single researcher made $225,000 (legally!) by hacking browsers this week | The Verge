{"Main text":"For the past two days, security researchers have descended on Vancouver forÂ  a Google-sponsored contest called Pwn2Own , which offers top-dollar prizes for anyone who can publicly exploit bugs in popular browsers and other widely used software like Adobe Flash.\nMore than half a million dollars for 21 bugs\nThis year was a particularly lucrative one, as a researcher named JungHoon Lee (also known as lokihardt) came away from the contest with a record $225,000 for three bugs, affecting Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari. The Chrome bug was the most lucrative, earning $110,000 in total, bringing in extra money because it involved a beta version of Chrome and because Lee was able to exploit the bug into system access. The Chrome bug was revealed in a single two-minute presentation, which, as one observer pointed out, put Lee's earnings at $916 per second.\nAt the end of the contest, all vulnerabilities are privately disclosed to vendors in the \"Chamber of Disclosures.\" It's a particularly high-stakes version of a bug bounty program, a system that has become increasingly popular as companies look for legal ways to discover weaknesses before attackers do. This year's contest found 21 bugs in total \u2014 including five bugs in Windows, four bugs in Internet Explorer, and three bugs in Firefox \u2014 and paid a total of $557,500 to participating researchers.\n","Title":"A single researcher made $225,000 (legally!) by hacking browsers this week | The Verge","Tags":["google","tech"]}
