{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nIt's not going to surprise anyone that there's probably a new Call of Duty title coming out. But yesterday, some players discovered a weird, fairly subtle little Easter egg that seems to hint at the next game. As demonstrated by streamer Drift0r and a photo on Twitter , the 2012 game Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 got a mysterious update earlier this week. The update, which has apparently come to Xbox  and PlayStation 3 but not PC, seems to have changed a specific poster that can be found in a couple of the maps, adding a distinctive symbol: Snapchat's QR code-like ghost stamp, which lets users add a friend by scanning it.\nUnsurprisingly, this particular code points you to the Call of Duty Snapchat account. Once you've befriended it \u2014 as we did \u2014 you'll get a new snap:\n\u2014 Nick (@Nipple_Nicholas) April 7, 2015\nDrift0r and others fairly credibly guess that this is a teaser for Black Ops 3, although nothing so specific shows up in the hint. Even if you don't care at all about Call of Duty, it's a cute and pretty distinctive trick. Snapchat's contact codes were only rolled out  a few months ago ; they're not precisely cryptic, but unlike a standard-issue QR code, they're also immediately understandable. With E3 and all its attendant game announcements just around the corner, it might even be worth keeping an eye out for more ghosts.\n","Title":"A Snapchat Easter egg is hiding in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 | The Verge","Tags":["gaming","culture","entertainment"]}
