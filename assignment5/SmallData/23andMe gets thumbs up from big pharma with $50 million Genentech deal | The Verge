The ambitious genetics startup has received  a first payment of $10 million from biotech company Genentech in exchange for genetic data donated by customers of 23andMe\u2019s personal genome service.  Forbes reports that the Silicon Valley company \u2014 which is partly backed by Google Ventures \u2014 can look forward to additional payments of \"as much as $50 million,\" with Genentech reportedly planning to dig out anonymous individuals from the company's database for further study.\n23andMe's medical reports have been banned \u2014 but it still has the genetic data that they collected\nFor 23andMe, the investment is a lifeline. In late 2013, the company was  banned from selling the health reports produced using its saliva test kits after they were judged to be in violation of the FDA\u2019s marketing guidelines. Although the company was allowed to continue selling  ancestry reports and uninterpreted genetic information , some members of the medical community seized upon the ban as proof that 23andMe\u2019s mission to make genetic testing available outside the doctor\u2019s office was misguided. However, by this point the company had attracted some 800,000 customers, three-quarters of whom consented to have their data used anonymously for medical research. It\u2019s this information that is now being sold on for use in for-profit medical research to keep 23andMe afloat.\nThis may surprise some of the startup's customers, but by all accounts, selling anonymous medical data was always part of the company's business plan. It was certainly never going to make enough money to survive from its home tests alone. ( In 2012 it slashed the prices for its kits from $299 to $99 while rival firm deCODEme sold a similar service for $1,100.) However, interest in this data from Genentech shows that the multi-trillion dollar big pharma industry is finally taking 23andMe seriously. Genentech isn't just a biotech company \u2014 it's also the US arm of Swiss giant Roche, the world's fifth-largest pharmaceutical company which boasts annual revenue of some  $50 billion . It's not the first such deal either \u2014 23andMe has previously  partnered with Pfizer to further research into inflammatory bowel disease.\nwithout FDA approval to sell home dna tests, 23ANDMe can only survive for so long\nThe problem now for 23andMe is that its current database of genetic information will only be useful for so long. Speaking to Forbes, chief executive Anne Wojcicki says that the company is \"in it for the long haul,\" but it will need to work hard to get the FDA on side and return to offering the public DNA tests. However, it's already  expanding to the UK , and if big pharmaceutical companies continue to validate its work and methods, then government approval will likely follow.\n","Title":"23andMe gets thumbs up from big pharma with $50 million Genentech deal | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech"]}
