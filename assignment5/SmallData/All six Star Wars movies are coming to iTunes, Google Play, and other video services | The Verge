{"Main text":"Share on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\nThe Star Wars movies are coming to smartphones. All six movies \u2014 yes, even The Phantom Menace, unfortunately \u2014 will be launched on digital video services such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Instant Video, and Xbox Video around the world on April 10th,  Disney and Lucasfilm announced today . The launch will allow fans to buy Digital HD versions of the movies individually, or get them all at once as part of the Star Wars Digital Movie Collection.\nThe six movies each come with bonus features, including documentaries, interviews with production staff, deleted scenes, and closer looks at the films' models and sets. Some digital retailers are also offering extra incentives to buy the movies from their marketplace \u2014 get the entire collection  from Xbox Video and you'll earn a digital R2-D2 to accompany your creepy, blank-faced Xbox Live avatar, a pinball table for the free-to-play Pinball FX 2, and access to an Xbox-only featurette.\nBuy the collection on Xbox Video to earn an imaginary R2-D2\nA number of digital retailers have yet to specify the price for the collection, but the whole bundle is available for $89 on the Google Play store, with individual movies going for $19.99. There were  rumors last year that Disney was planning to re-release the original Star Wars movies on Blu-ray without George Lucas' CGI spot-welding, but viewers don't appear to be able to choose which version of the movie they want to watch with the upcoming Digital HD editions. Purchasers of the new versions will have to cope with unconvincing Dewbacks, Han having the gall to step on Jabba's tail, and the disconcerting sight of a moody Hayden Christensen as Vader's ghost at the Endor feast. At least they'll be in high resolution.\nVerge Video: Star Wars- Episode VII adds new cast and Millenium Falcon\n","Title":"All six Star Wars movies are coming to iTunes, Google Play, and other video services | The Verge","Tags":["apple","google","culture","entertainment","tech"]}
