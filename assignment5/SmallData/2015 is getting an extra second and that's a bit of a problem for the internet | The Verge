Or, to be more precise, they\u2019ll change to the uncharted time of 23:59:60 \u2014 before ticking over to the more worldly hour of 00:00:00 on the morning of July 1st, 2015. This addition of a leap second,  announced by the Paris Observatory this week , is being added to keep terrestrial clocks in step with the vagaries of astronomical time \u2014 in this case, the slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation. And it's a bit of a headache for computer engineers.\nWhat causes leap seconds? Earthquakes, tidal drag, the weather\nLeap seconds are like the Y2K bug in that they threaten to throw out of sync time as measured by computers and time as measured by atomic clocks. But while Y2K was a single instance (computer systems that were used to abbreviating the year to two digits were confused by \"2000\" and \"1900\"), the addition of leap seconds are a regular problem. The first was added back in 1972; this year\u2019s will be the 26th, and they're  not likely to stop coming . They're also broadly unpredictable: earthquakes, tidal drag, and the weather all affect the rotation of the Earth, and it\u2019s up to the scientists at the  International Earth Rotation Service to keep an eye on things and call the changes as they come.\nUnfortunately, when the last leap second was added back in 2012, more than a few sites had trouble keeping pace. As reported by  Phys.org, Foursquare, Reddit, LinkedIn, and StumbledUpon all crashed when the leap second ticked unexpectedly into place. In the case of Reddit, the problem was  eventually traced back to a Linux subsystem that got confused when it checked the Network Time Protocol only to find an extra second.  Speaking to Wired about the problem back in 2012, Linux creator Linus Torvalds commented: \"Almost every time we have a leap second, we find something. It\u2019s really annoying, because it\u2019s a classic case of code that is basically never run, and thus not tested by users under their normal conditions.\"\nGoogle solves the problem of the extra second by cutting it into milliseconds\nInstead, companies have been forced to create their own workaround, with Google\u2019s \"leap smear\" perhaps the best-known example. As the company\u2019s site reliability engineer Christopher Pascoe  explained in a blog post , the usual fix is to turn back the clocks by one second at the end of the day, essentially playing that second again. However, says Pascoe, this creates problems: \"What happens to write operations that happen during that second? Does email that comes in during that second get stored correctly?\" Google\u2019s solution is to cut the extra second into milliseconds and then sprinkle these tiny portions of time into the system imperceptibly throughout the day. \"This [means] that when it became time to add an extra second at midnight,\" says Pascoe, \"our clocks [have] already taken this into account, by skewing the time over the course of the day.\"\nCould we detach our concept of time from the solar day?\nOf course, not every website or company has the sort of engineering resources needed to implement something like a \"leap smear,\" and when June 30th rolls around in the summer, you can expect to see the odd outage or two. Beyond clever engineering though, there's not much to be done. As  The Telegraph reports , there are some factions in the US that would like to drop the leap second altogether, but doing so would mean unmooring our concept of time from one of the most fundamental timescales, the solar day, and setting civil time on a path forever  diverging from time as measured by our planet . Would it be worth the trouble? We'll get another chance to find out on June 30th.\n","Title":"2015 is getting an extra second and that's a bit of a problem for the internet | The Verge","Tags":["science","tech"]}
