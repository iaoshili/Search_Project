For Professor: 

In this assignment, I use your solution code. I create two new directories called assignment3_p and assignment4_p which initially is a copy of the solution code.

In this assignment, I write the reformatter.py including in the assignment5 folder. Also the assignment5/start.py to initial three MapReduce subprocess.

The mapper/reducer script is in assignment4_p. And made a few changes to the assignment3.

In the root directory:

run `./assignment5/reformat_all.sh` will create three folders with data for the mapreduce program.

Then `python -m assignment4_p.workers` will initiate the map reduce workers.

Then `python -m assignment5.start` will execute these three map reducer programs.

Then `python -m assignment3_p.start` will start up the search engine.
