VA new LG watch was just teased at Audi's CES press conference | The Verge
p2
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAudi's CES press conference isn't where we expected to get a tease of a new LG smartwatch, but that's how CES goes. Audi's Ulrich Hackenberg just summoned a self-driving car to the stage using an LG smartwatch, and the design doesn't match up at all with any others we've seen from the company \u2014 the three-button design in particular stood out to us. The big question is what exactly the watch is running. While it's easy to assume that it's an update to the company's ever-expanding Android Wear lineup, there have been recent rumors that LG could bring webOS back yet again, this time on a smartwatch. Unfortunately, Audi's press conference ended without anyone mentioning the watch again, but we're trying to track down Dr. Hackenberg and see if we can find out more about his new wearable.\u000aUpdate: We got to take a closer look at the watch following the press event, but unfortunately we couldn't get any questions answered about it just yet. We're still digging for more info.\u000aUpdate, 4:23PM ET: Android Central has confirmed with LG that this watch was made specifically for Audi and runs a customized version of Android Wear. The dreams of a webOS watch will have to wait for another day.\u000aUpdate, January 7th 2015, 9:13PM ET: After claiming the smartwatch seen at Audi's press conference ran Android Wear, Android Central now has proof that the device actually does run webOS. Find out more here .\u000a

VAcid test: LSD used as drug therapy for the first time in 40 years | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSwiss scientists broke a four-decade-long informal ban on LSD research yesterday when they announced the results of  a study in which cancer patients received the drug to curb their anxiety about death.\u000aThe study, which was published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, looked at the safety and efficacy of LSD when used in combination with talk therapy. The researchers used the semisynthetic psychedelic drug to facilitate discussions about the cancer patients' fears of dying. The patients who took LSD, most of whom were terminally ill, experienced 10-hour-long supervised "trips." One patient described the trips to The New York Times as a "mystical experience," where "the major part was pure distress at all the memories I had successfully forgotten for decades."\u000aThese periods of distress are regarded as therapeutically valuable because they allow patients to address their memories and the emotions they evoke. The patients underwent 30 such trips over the course of two months.\u000aA year after the sessions ceased, the patients who had received a full dose of LSD \u2014 200 micrograms \u2014 experienced a 20 percent improvement in their anxiety levels. That was not the case for the group who received a lower dose, however, as their anxiety symptoms actually increased. They were later allowed to try the full dose after the trial had ended.\u000a"We want to break these substances out of the mold of the counterculture."\u000aBecause of the small number of study participants, the researchers are reluctant to make any conclusive statements about the LSD treatment's effectiveness. Indeed, the results were not statistically significant. But the fact that the study took place at all bodes well for psychedelic drug research, as the drug caused no serious side effects. Rick Doblin, executive director of the  Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , a foundation that has funded many of these studies, thinks that revisiting LSD-based treatments is worthwhile. "We want to break these substances out of the mold of the counterculture," Doblin told The New York Times, "and bring them back to the lab as part of a psychedelic renaissance."\u000a

VAlcatel Onetouch Watch review | The Verge
p8
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIn the nascent world of wearables, there have been two camps. The fitness trackers, like a Fitbit or a Jawbone, and the smartwatches, like Android Wear and the Apple Watch . The common thinking has been that these two camps will soon converge, and there\u2019s been a lot of evidence that such a future is not far off. Fitness tracking is a big component of the Apple Watch and a number of Android Wear devices, and Fitbit\u2019s latest models have a lot of smartwatch capabilities to augment their fitness tracking.\u000aYet while many smartwatches have fitness tracking and many fitness trackers have smartwatch features, both options demand compromises. You either choose between great fitness-tracking features or smartwatch productivity. Alcatel\u2019s new Onetouch Watch, a $149.99 wrist-worn wearable shipping this month, is just the latest device trying to be both.\u000aAfter wearing the Onetouch Watch for the past week, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s not a great smartwatch, nor is it a great fitness tracker. Instead, it asks a different compromise: are you willing to give up the best in either category for something that\u2019s cheaper than most smartwatches and better looking than most fitness trackers?\u000aAt first glance, the Onetouch Watch belongs in the smartwatch camp. With its round face, metal body, and color display, it\u2019s easy to compare it to Motorola\u2019s Moto 360. But while the Moto 360 is a full Android Wear-powered smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch runs on a proprietary platform that works with both Android and iOS devices. Aside from the cross-platform benefit, the Onetouch Watch is slimmer, cheaper, and lasts longer between charges than most other smartwatches.\u000aAesthetically, the Onetouch Watch is considerably nicer than many other wearables, especially in this price range. It\u2019s round, much like a traditional watch, isn\u2019t as thick as most Android Wear devices, and has a design that can work with a wide variety of outfits or personal styles. It doesn\u2019t look like a computer on my wrist nor does it attempt to make a fashion statement like the Apple Watch \u2014 to most people, I\u2019m just wearing a generic digital watch.\u000aAt the center of the round face is a 1.22-inch color touchscreen with 240 x 204 pixel resolution. It\u2019s not a full circle \u2014 there\u2019s a flat area at the bottom just like on the Moto 360 \u2014 and you can certainly see pixels, but it\u2019s bright and vibrant with great viewing angles. It\u2019s easily visible outdoors, which isn\u2019t something I can say for a lot of smartwatches with color screens. Most of the time the Watch\u2019s display is off \u2014 you wake it up by pressing the button on the side or raising your arm as if to check the time. The gesture actually works with less lag than I expected, but I still prefer a watch that lets me check the time without moving my arm.\u000aCharging the Onetouch Watch doesn't require clumsy adapters \u2014 just plug it into a USB port\u000aThe Onetouch Watch has a fixed rubber strap that\u2019s flexible and comfortable to wear all day. It comes in two colors \u2014 white or black  \u2014 but it isn\u2019t interchangeable, so you\u2019re stuck with whichever one you pick from the outset. The fixed band does have a couple of key advantages: there\u2019s an NFC chip inside the band for quick pairing and a built-in USB plug for charging. The USB plug at the end of the strap might be the smartest part of the Watch\u2019s design: you can plug into any USB port to recharge the watch, no clumsy adapters needed.\u000aTapping the screen launches a basic grid for the various built-in apps on the Watch. There\u2019s a simple weather app, compass, music controller, phone locator, and an app to remotely take pictures with your phone\u2019s camera. There\u2019s also the fitness-tracking apps, which can count steps, track distance traveled, track your sleep, and measure your heart rate.\u000aThere are three basic watch face designs (two analog, one digital), and you can customize the colors and background of the watch face. You access notifications by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, which is a bit clumsy and not too easy to do when you\u2019re on the go. The flat area at the bottom of the display also acts as a back button to navigate through the hierarchy of the interface.\u000aNotifications are where the Onetouch Watch fails as a smartwatch\u000aNotifications on the Onetouch Watch are where its smartwatch leanings start to fall apart. Like any other smartwatch, it\u2019s convenient to get buzzes on your wrist when something or someone is trying to get your attention. But the Watch\u2019s display does not light up automatically when notifications come in, nor does the notification drawer pop up by itself, requiring me to touch the watch with my other hand to see what just made it buzz. The Watch only lets me read the notification \u2014 there\u2019s no clearing it or acting upon it from my wrist. Further, the Watch only supports notifications from select apps (calls, messages, email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Google+, Google Hangouts, and Gmail), so there was no way to configure it to see alerts from my email app of choice ( Outlook ) or get alerts from Google Now. Alcatel tells me that it will add support for more app notifications in the future, but it will be relying on feedback from users for what apps to add.\u000aThe other smartwatch things you might look for \u2014 third-party apps, custom watch faces, and voice control \u2014 aren\u2019t available on the Onetouch Watch. With its limited support for notifications and lack of these extra features, it\u2019s better to think of this as a fitness device with some smartwatch features rather than a smartwatch with fitness features.\u000aSo how does it fare as a fitness device? Fine enough for what it is, but what it is turns out to be pretty limited. I\u2019ll start with the good parts. The companion app for iOS and Android lets you view your activity and set goals with an informative and attractive dashboard. Thankfully, the Watch\u2019s step counting isn\u2019t as wildly inaccurate as other trackers I\u2019ve worn. The  heart rate monitoring may be slow, but it\u2019s consistent and about as accurate as any other wrist-worn monitor I\u2019ve tried. I could easily see someone choosing to wear the Onetouch Watch just because it\u2019s a decent-looking device that counts their steps. (This is also the entire appeal of the Withings Activité line .)\u000aFitness tracking is accurate, but there's a lot of room for improvement\u000aYet as much as I like the fitness tracking, there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement. I can set my goals and see charts of my activity in the companion app, but unless I\u2019m consciously checking my progress throughout the day, the watch doesn\u2019t actively encourage me to get up and work toward hitting my goals. The data captured by the watch doesn\u2019t sync with Apple\u2019s Health app, Google\u2019s Fit platform, or any other service, trapping it within Alcatel\u2019s system. That\u2019s actually a huge disappointment, because most fitness trackers at this price give you the added benefit of participating in some kind of ecosystem. Either you can compare your scores with friends or at least get plugged into either Android or Apple\u2019s built-in system for fitness. There\u2019s also a sleep-tracking system on Alcatel\u2019s watch, but it\u2019s not automatic, so I need to start it each night and stop it when I wake up.\u000aSo why would you want to accept all these limitations? Well, for one, you might just like the traditional, no-nonsense look of the watch. For another, the Onetouch Watch outlasts all other smartwatches with color displays when it comes to battery life. I\u2019ve been able to get a full two days between charges with it, and even more if I take it off at night and forget about the (questionably useful) sleep tracking. Combine that with the super convenient built-in USB port on the strap, and the Watch is one of the least annoying wearables you can buy when it comes to battery life and charging.\u000aThe Onetouch Watch embodies the split between smartwatches and fitness trackers, and it\u2019s emblematic of what is about to be a deluge of also-ran wearables. It\u2019s a fitness tracker posing as a smartwatch, but it doesn\u2019t do as well as the best options in either category.\u000aIf you want a fitness tracker that looks more like a traditional watch than a sport band, the Onetouch Watch is more appealing than a Fitbit or a Jawbone. It\u2019s attractive, lasts long enough between charges, has reliable and accurate step and activity tracking, and is less expensive than similarly equipped devices. The downside is that your data is trapped inside Alcatel\u2019s ecosystem instead of a more open or useful platform.\u000aA fitness tracker posing as a smartwatch\u000aBut as a smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to useful notifications on your wrist. It also doesn\u2019t have the expandability of Pebble, Apple Watch, or Android Wear through third-party apps. The Onetouch Watch is cheap, and it looks good, but that\u2019s where its appeal ends as a smartwatch.\u000aIt\u2019s an in-between wearable device that doesn\u2019t have the platform support of Apple or Google, nor the fitness tracking chops of Fitbit, Jawbone, and the like. You\u2019re going to see a lot of devices like this on the shelves at Best Buy, because it turns out that making a basic smartwatch and making a basic fitness tracker is getting to be pretty easy. But making something that does both well? That\u2019s really hard.\u000a

VAcer is launching an all-in-one Chromebase desktop with a touchscreen this summer | The Verge

aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aWhile Google's Chromebooks are finding a measure of success in certain markets, Chrome OS hasn't exactly found much traction in other form factors, like the Mac mini-esque Chromebox or all-in-one Chromebase. That's not stopping Acer from offering up its own take on the all-in-one desktop \u2014 the company just announced its own Chromebase. Unlike the Chromebase that LG  first introduced in late 2013 , this one has a new hardware trick \u2014 its 21.5-inch, 1080p display is a giant touchscreen.\u000aChrome OS form factors beyond the laptop haven't really caught on yet\u000aThe utility of such a screen remains a bit in question, however. Unlike Windows, Chrome OS isn't exactly designed with touch in mind \u2014 but that's slowly starting to change. Google  announced a touchscreen Chromebook from Asus that can be used in tablet mode yesterday, and alongside it will be a few tweaks to Chrome OS that'll make it a bit more touch-friendly. When you consider the fact that Android apps will soon be coming to Chrome OS as well, those touchscreens make a lot more sense than they did a year ago.\u000aAs far as the rest of the hardware goes, the Chromebase will run on Nvidia's Tegra K1 processor. It sounds like Acer will offer a few configurations \u2014 we were told that it'll have "up to 4GB" of RAM. Storage is the typically minimum 16GB found in most Chrome OS devices, but Acer is including 100GB of Google Drive storage for two years. There's no pricing info yet, either \u2014 but if this machine fits your needs, Acer will sell you one sometime during Q2.\u000aUpdate, 3:40PM ET: Added details on the RAM and storage from Acer.\u000a

VAcer Chromebook 15: a first look at the biggest Chromebook on Earth | The Verge
p20
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAcer kicked off its CES yesterday by announcing the $249 Chromebook 15, a new Chromebook laptop that \u2014 for now at least \u2014 is the biggest one you can buy. We just got our hands on it here in Las Vegas, and even at a glance it looks like there's fierce new competitor in the Chromebook market.\u000aFirst and foremost, it's built really well. The laptop has a very solid feel but is still light enough to comfortably carry in one hand, even lighter than other, smaller Chromebooks. The black plastic doesn't feel as cheap as the plastic found making up competing models, either. There's a nice mesh-style pattern on the back of it, which helps it stand out without being as aggressive as what's found on the Toshiba Chromebook 2 or flashy as on Samsung's Chromebook 2 .\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThe keyboard's chiclet keys are responsive and have a good action to them, and the trackpad was similarly impressive. There's room to navigate both comfortably \u2014 it's not as cramped as Acer's 13- and 11-inch competitors tend to be. The model we got to look at had a 1360x768 screen that is good but not great (the company will be offering a 1080p version), and Acer takes advantage of the extra real estate afforded by the 15-inch build by lining the keyboard with stereo speakers.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is reminiscent of Apple's black MacBooks\u000aAll told, Acer's actually made something very reminiscent of the black MacBooks that many people often opine fondly about, and together these things appear to make the Chromebook 15 feel like one of the most well-rounded Chromebooks made yet.\u000aAvailable in February for $249, it sits right in the comfortable middle ground as far as Chromebook pricing goes. But Chromebooks aren't just competing with other Chromebooks anymore, because laptop makers are coming up with ways to make full-featured laptops cheaper and cheaper. It won't be long until price is as persuasive a selling point for Chromebooks as it is right now. Until then, consider Acer's Chromebook 15 one of the best new options around.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

aVA GoPro dropped from 10,000 feet looks like nausea-inducing Spin Art\u000aGoPros can't fly, but they drop like a champ\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aRemember Spin Art commercials? They'd run on Nickelodeon after school in the Stick Stickly programming block, where the network would trade a couple animated shorts for a couple hours of ads pushing products that never worked as well in your living room as they did in a Burbank film studio. Anyway, the view from a GoPro, dropped from roughly 9,800 ft., reminds me of Spin Art. The colors begin from the center, working their way outward in jagged rings, then disappearing from view, making way for new colors bursting from within.\u000aUnlike Spin Art, which was an unreliable piece of plastic the few times I had the honor of trying it (that must have been decades ago, yeesh), the GoPro proves its mettle, somehow still recording after colliding with our planet.\u000aNow let's find these skydivers. Here's the message from YouTuber Kristoffer Örstadius:\u000aMy dad, a mycologist, found an GoPro camera in Gringelstad outside Kristianstad. He found it on the ground in a forest. The memory card was intact - and this is the last film. Are you the right skydiver? Please let me know so we can send you the camera and the memory card.\u000aCorrection: The original headline said the GoPro was dropped from 30,000 ft. It has been corrected to 10,000 ft. The GoPro's survival remains no less a miracle.\u000a
