VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAlcatel first revealed details of its upcoming smartwatch a few days ago, and now we're getting our first chance to check it out and get more details on what will set this device apart from its Android Wear competition. Perhaps most notable is the fact that the Alcatel Onetouch Watch will support both iOS and Android devices, something that sets it apart from nearly every other smartwatch on the market (with the notable exception of the Pebble line of watches).\u000aMuch like Android Wear, Alcatel's Watch is controlled through a companion app for iOS and Android \u2014 from there you can do things like pick which apps will notify you, view all your health data the watch has collected, adjust themes and colors for the watch, and generally manage all of the ways the watch can communicate with your phone. If you're using an Android phone, any app that can send notifications can push them to the phone, but iOS appears to be more limited, at least for now. We know Apple's phone, messaging, and mail apps will work with the Watch, but third-party support appears to be up in the air.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThe main interface itself is controlled not by swiping the screen, but by tapping near the bottom edge of the Watch. When you raise your wrist, the screen activates (similar to the Apple Watch), and tapping will cycle between the watch face and the menu, which is a colorful, Windows-style scroll of the apps that can run directly on the watch. Unfortunately, the interface isn't quite as fluid and responsive as most Android Wear devices we've tried, but it's certainly useable enough. That said, trying to hit the small "home" area at the bottom of the watch is occasionally frustrating.\u000aAnother way Alcatel says its smartwatch will stand out is in the battery department: the company says it'll can last at least two days, and possible up to five under the right circumstances. Android Wear, on the other hand, has been generally disappointing in the battery department, and Apple has strongly hinted that you'll need to charge its Watch every day as well.\u000aSUPPORT FOR ANDROID AND IOS IS GREAT, BUT THE INTERFACE NEEDS A LITTLE WORK\u000aAs for the wearable's main features, Alcatel has given us a bit more info than we had the other day. From a health monitoring perspective, the Watch will use its build-in heart rate monitor, accelerometer, gyroscope, altimeter and e- compass to measure the usual metrics like sleep cycles, steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned. The other expected feature is the aforementioned notifications and multimedia control \u2014 It'll also vibrate if you get a certain distance away from your phone, and you can use the Watch to make your phone ring if you misplace it. Tapping the screen also brings up multimedia controls, and you can use it as a remote shutter for your phone's camera, as well.\u000aFrom a style perspective, the Watch will come in four versions \u2014 two "micro-textured resin" models in black / red and white as well as two metal options \u2014 unfortunately, those metal options aren't coming out until later this year. It feels much like a Moto 360 (right down to the small missing slice at the bottom of the watch's interface), though it's a bit smaller and lighter than the Motorola. The band itself feels fine on the wrist, though the clasp is a bit awkward to use. What isn't awkward is the small, hidden, USB charging port \u2014 a much better option for powering up your Watch than the goofy docks or proprietary cables that most smartwatches use.\u000aWhile the Alcatel Onetouch Watch didn't quite feel like the most polished product we've ever seen, its entry price of $149 currently undercuts most ever Android Wear device out there. But the Watch doesn't appear to offer any features that you can't get on Android Wear, and it doesn't have Google's nice voice-activated commands and search options. If you're an iOS user, however, and think the Apple Watch will be too rich for your blood, Alcatel's watch might be worth a look. It'll be available this March and will be on sale at Amazon.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAcer is one of the best Chromebook manufacturers out there, and today it's unveiling two new machines that it wants to see enter the classroom. The Chromebooks are two different sizes \u2014 one has a 15.6-inch display and the other has an 11.6-inch display \u2014 but the standout feature here is what they have in common: both are built to be tough enough to withstand drops and general mishandling. Acer says that both Chromebooks have "reinforced covers" that are able to withstand 60kg of force as well as "reinforced" hinges that are capable of standing up to unusual twisting and stress. The corners are also said to be able to withstand nearly 1.5-foot drops without taking damage.\u000aAcer's biggest Chromebook is a tough one\u000aThese are otherwise fairly standard Chromebooks \u2014 which is to say, they're cheap, powerful enough to browse the web, and just stylish enough to not be considered ugly. Both machines will include one of Intel's Broadwell processors, either a Core i3 or a Celeron. The larger Chromebook, called the C910, will have a 16GB or 32GB SSD and 4GB of RAM, and it'll have the option of either a 1920 x 1080 display or a 1366 x 768 display (naturally, you'll want the former \u2014 but the latter is meant to "meet the budgets of schools"). It'll be available at a base price of $299.99. The smaller Chromebook, the C740, has a 16GB SSD, either 2GB or 4GB of RAM, and will start at $259.99. They'll both be available in February.\u000aAcer's C740 appears to look identical to the C720, seen above.\u000aThough Acer says that the C910 is being newly announced today, it's not clear what, if any, difference there is between it and  the Chromebook 15 that was  announced earlier this month . At most, it looks like some variants of the 15-inch machine are headed for classrooms, while a less-expensive variant of the 15-inch machine will be marketed toward general consumers. That latter model is supposed to go on sale for just $249 \u2014 $50 cheaper than the C910. It's not clear whether the enhanced durability will be exclusive to the education model.\u000aYou may not want to pick up a Chromebook that's specifically meant for the classroom, but you probably won't be disappointed if one of these ends up in yours. Acer has consistently made some of the best Chromebooks around \u2014 we've been fans of its C720 line, in particular \u2014 so there's little reason to doubt that these new ones will be solid options. Acer says that they should have great battery life, too (eight hours for the bigger machine, and nine hours for the smaller one), which should be plenty long for laptops that need to be passed around the classroom.\u000aAcer's C910 appears to be a variant of the Chromebook 15, seen above.\u000a

VA tiny startup has made big strides in creating self-navigating drones\u000aVeterans of Google X and MIT have created some remarkable computer vision systems\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSome of the biggest news out of CES this year was the huge progress companies have made on technology that can help drones be aware of their surroundings , allowing them to sense objects and avoid collisions. Those breakthroughs were powered by well-established drone companies like Ascending Technologies and semiconductor giants like Intel. Earlier this week, in a small park along the San Francisco Bay, I got to see another take on "sense and avoid." It came from a small startup,  Skydio , and it was as impressive as anything I saw from the titans of tech.\u000aSkydio was created by three friends who met at MIT. Adam Bry and Abe Bachrach were in the robust robotics program, researching ways to build aircraft that could fly themselves without GPS, culminating in a fixed wing drone with a laser range finder that autonomously navigated its way around a parking lot. After that, Adam and Abe were part of the founding team for Google X\u2019s Project Wing , designing and building the delivery drone that flew over Australia.\u000aAfter a year and a half, the pair left Google X and along with Matt Donahoe, who they met at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, set out to create a system to power self-navigating drones using only the commodity chips and and sensors you would find in your average smartphone. Today Skydio, which has been working in stealth for around a year, announced a $3 million round of funding from Andreessen Horowitz and Accel.\u000aRight now most drones stabilize themselves using GPS and some can even use that signal to navigate a course or follow you around. But they are helpless if they lose GPS and also can\u2019t see trees on a ski slope and know to avoid them when they following you to film. Powerful sense and avoid would make drones safer by giving them the ability to correct for bad pilots. It would also make autonomous flight more robust, allowing drones to avoid obstacles. Without it, the fantasy of a delivery drone landing on your lawn would remain just that.\u000a"The goal is to take something that normally costs $5,000 and sell it for $50."\u000aAt CES we saw the beginnings of this, using powerful, expensive sensors custom built by Intel. Skydio is betting that they can achieve robust sense and avoid using only ordinary cameras, instead of the lasers, sonar, and depth of field cameras we saw at CES. "The goal is to take something that normally costs $5,000 and sell it for $50," says Bry, the CEO. "We think vision is going to win the day. It\u2019s an incredibly rich data source, it\u2019s just algorithmically challenging. But computers are getting faster and these algos are coming into place."\u000aSkydio gave us a demo of their drone, a prototype quadcopter with two small cameras feeding a video stream into a small Intel media center. The unit had no GPS, which is how a normal drone would orient itself, but after takeoff it hovered completely in place, holding its position as well as or better than any drone I\u2019ve seen. "It\u2019s doing that 100% based on the visual it has of us standing here," Donahoe explained.\u000aThe first demo Donahoe walked me through was called the "Magic Wand." You point your phone at the drone, which is connected to it over Wi-Fi. Tap to initiate control, then move your arm in any direction and the drone will move as well, pivoting to keep you in focus. It worked remarkably well and had a much simpler interface than any of the "follow me" drones I tested at CES.\u000aRight now a bulky controller is the command prompt of drones\u000a"Right now this is the command prompt on a drone," said Bry, hefting the RC flight controller, with its two joysticks and multitude of buttons and switches. "If you\u2019re an expert operator, and you\u2019re trained, you can get really incredible photos and video. We want to find a way to deliver that same power, but in a much more intuitive way that is open to anyone with a smartphone."\u000aSince it\u2019s based on computer vision, Skydio\u2019s system would struggle to work under poor lighting conditions or in weather like rain and snow. "It\u2019s kind of intuitive," said Bachrach. "If a person watching the video would have difficulty figuring out what\u2019s going on, then the software probably would as well."\u000a"It will seem crazy that a drone would ever crash."\u000aI asked the Skydio team how good the system would have to be in order to be commercially viable. A drone that only crashes one in 10,000 times? One in a million? "Realistically the first systems won\u2019t be perfect," says Bry. "But right now there is nothing available to the average consumer. Something is better than nothing."\u000aThe idea is to use sense and avoid technology initially as a redundant safety feature that helps pilots avoid obstacles. As it gets better\u2014 and assuming the FAA allows the consumer drone trend to continue \u2014 it will be employed in more autonomous situations, like filming your kid on the soccer field or checking out a leaky roof to see what needs a fix. "It\u2019s going to be a very long term project to make a perfect, robust system, but I think in five or six years you will just trust the unit," says Bry. "It can see the world and know where it needs to move or land to avoid problems. It will seem crazy that a drone would ever crash."\u000aAccel is also an investor in Vox Media, parent company of The Verge.\u000a

V5 film techniques J.J. Abrams will use to showcase his Star Wars universe\u000aGet ready for some (subtle) lens flare.\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOne of the great pleasures of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer is seeing a new director inject his own flourishes into an already visually distinctive series. The Star Wars visual catalog has a few staples that have stayed consistent throughout the series: think transitional wipes and pilot POV shots. Unfortunately, the prequels saw George Lucas expand the toolset with a lot of uninspired tricks: slow zooms on wide shots , Barbara Walters glow , and a stubborn use of a locked-down camera.\u000aFrom the looks of the new Star Wars trailer, J.J. Abrams and his cinematographer, Dave Mindel, seem to be trading out the bad visual trademarks and replacing them with some of their own. Here are some examples of what we might be able to expect from Abrams\u2019 visual take on the galaxy.\u000aThe Dolly Shot\u000aIt\u2019s a pretty basic camera move. The gist is that a camera, usually on a track or Steadicam rig, moves forward into the subject, going from a wide shot to a medium shot.  J.J. Abrams does this a lot. Though it is a tried-and-true technique, what makes his dolly moves really dynamic is that while the camera moves forward on the Z-axis, there\u2019s action moving on the X-axis.\u000aSo in this shot, you have the camera moving toward R2-D2 and embers flying from left to right. The combination of Z and X movement can also be seen in the previous Star Wars trailer . It won't add to the Star Wars visual repertoire, but it\u2019s nice to see a killer dolly move in a series that rarely has them.\u000aLens Flares\u000aWait, what? Where?!\u000aIt\u2019s been exhaustively noted that J.J. Abrams loves his lens flares, and he hasn\u2019t taken the criticism lying down. There was significantly less of it in Star Trek Into Darkness, for example.  But if you think The Force Awakens will do away completely with this visual flourish, well you\u2019d be wrong, yet also kind of right.  There are lens flares in there, but they are subtle as all hell. J.J. Abrams actually falls in line with the Star Wars visual design.  Anything more than what we saw in the Darth Maul fight scene would be pushing the boundaries. I think we can all agree with this amount of subtle lens flare; J.J. Abrams can love them all he wants.\u000aShaky Cam Aerial Battles\u000aIt\u2019s a visual holdover from his Star Trek films, and I think it will be a stake in the ground for the rest of the Star Wars saga.  The smooth tracking shots we saw in the aerial battles of the prequels will be replaced with a visceral shaky cam perspective.  Personally, this is my favorite trademark of his, and I\u2019m glad to see it being put to use in Star Wars. The style really makes it feel like you\u2019re in the environment, feeling the turbulence of the action.\u000aCanted Angles\u000aWe got a small taste of the director\u2019s love of canted angles in the above shot. This is another one of Abrams\u2019 visual choices that I love, because he really understands how to properly weigh the shot composition. The canted angle can be pretty hard to pull off correctly since it can quickly fall into hokeyness \u2014 a  bad-looking canted angle has the subject in the center of the frame. But J.J. Abrams is really good at avoiding this pitfall, and creates a beautifully composed shot by populating one side of the frame more heavily than the other.\u000aIn the above shot, for example, you have the floaty TIE fighter lifting up the right side of the frame, while the explosions and the impact of the lasers pushing down the left side.  It looks great, and the canted angle remains natural.\u000aSnap Zoom\u000aThis snap zoom shot caused a lot of discussion among the Verge Staff .  J.J. Abrams used the technique to great effect in the Star Trek films , and he\u2019s using it again in Star Wars.  It\u2019s a precarious technique inspired by camcorder war footage. Surprisingly though, this technique actually fits within the Star Wars catalog of camera moves.  You\u2019ll see it used a couple of times in the Battle of Geonosis in Episode II . I\u2019m ambivalent on the technique being used here. It can bring a sense of realism, but also make you feel like you\u2019re in on the artifice of it all.\u000aI think this is all great and has got me more excited about Star Wars than ever before. Based on the trailer it looks like J.J. Abrams and company are doing away with the series' stale camera work. In the end I hope this opens the gates for the Star Wars directors to have more authorship over the saga, avoiding the sameness that plagues the Marvel films.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAcer kicked off its CES yesterday by announcing the $249 Chromebook 15, a new Chromebook laptop that \u2014 for now at least \u2014 is the biggest one you can buy. We just got our hands on it here in Las Vegas, and even at a glance it looks like there's fierce new competitor in the Chromebook market.\u000aFirst and foremost, it's built really well. The laptop has a very solid feel but is still light enough to comfortably carry in one hand, even lighter than other, smaller Chromebooks. The black plastic doesn't feel as cheap as the plastic found making up competing models, either. There's a nice mesh-style pattern on the back of it, which helps it stand out without being as aggressive as what's found on the Toshiba Chromebook 2 or flashy as on Samsung's Chromebook 2 .\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThe keyboard's chiclet keys are responsive and have a good action to them, and the trackpad was similarly impressive. There's room to navigate both comfortably \u2014 it's not as cramped as Acer's 13- and 11-inch competitors tend to be. The model we got to look at had a 1360x768 screen that is good but not great (the company will be offering a 1080p version), and Acer takes advantage of the extra real estate afforded by the 15-inch build by lining the keyboard with stereo speakers.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is reminiscent of Apple's black MacBooks\u000aAll told, Acer's actually made something very reminiscent of the black MacBooks that many people often opine fondly about, and together these things appear to make the Chromebook 15 feel like one of the most well-rounded Chromebooks made yet.\u000aAvailable in February for $249, it sits right in the comfortable middle ground as far as Chromebook pricing goes. But Chromebooks aren't just competing with other Chromebooks anymore, because laptop makers are coming up with ways to make full-featured laptops cheaper and cheaper. It won't be long until price is as persuasive a selling point for Chromebooks as it is right now. Until then, consider Acer's Chromebook 15 one of the best new options around.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VA new breed of startups is helping hackers make millions \u2014 legally\u000aThe bug bounty business is booming\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aShashank Kumar was in seventh grade when he was introduced to computer hacking. At first he had fun breaking in and defacing web sites, something he says he now regrets, but then he learned that he can get paid for reporting the weaknesses he was exploiting. Under the handle  @cyberboyIndia, he says he has earned around $30,000 in so called bug bounties, enough to pay for a good portion of his college education.\u000aThese days the 19-year-old is supposed to be cramming for his final exams as he prepares for a degree in engineering. But many nights he finds himself awake too late, laptop humming away, hunting for software vulnerabilities on services run by firms like Yahoo, Paypal, and AT&T. On Twitter, Shashank catalogs the rewards he receives for reporting weaknesses, a highlight reel that ranges from a free hat, to a new smartphone, to a $1,500 check. The money is good, although it\u2019s murder on his grades.\u000aopened laptop for 5 min. found something suspicious.Bug in Google spotted . ended up using laptop for 5 hours :/. thats why i fail in xam :|\u000a\u2014 Shashank (@cyberboyIndia) December 26, 2013\u000aShashank is part of a broader trend sweeping the security industry. Last week, Google announced that it was  changing the rules on its bug bounty program, Pwnium . Instead of a respectable $2.7million awarded once a year, the contest will now run year round, with a total prize pool of "\u221e million*." In other words the money never has to stop flowing, although Google\u2019s clever asterisk placement reserves the right to cancel at any time.\u000aGoogle upped its reward pool to infinity\u000aBut that\u2019s not likely to happen, at least if Google wants to stay competitive. Bug bounty programs used to work with informal rewards: a thank you letter, an online shoutout, a free t-shirt, or perhaps a few hundred dollars. But over the last five years, they have become a bonanza. Almost every major tech company has one running, and they have steadily increased the size and volume of rewards.\u000aMost importantly, a new breed of startups like Crowdcurity, Bugcrowd, Synack, and HackerOne have made it possible for any company to launch its own bug bounty, dramatically expanding the size of the market. Instead of being something only large technology companies do, bug bounties are now proliferating across all industries and for companies big and small, allowing these startups to pay out millions in rewards over the past two years.\u000aA new weapon in the endless war\u000a"It\u2019s changed the way we think about security," says Andrew Pile, the chief technology officer at Vimeo, which recently launched a bug bounty through HackerOne. "It would have been nearly impossible for us to build this kind of program in-house from scratch."\u000a"It changed the way we think about security."\u000aAs Vimeo grew in size over the years, it would receive occasional submissions about security flaws in its system, but Pile never felt comfortable paying for them. "The only way we could thank them was a free account or t-shirt, which didn\u2019t really encourage the best people to come back."\u000aLike most companies, Vimeo had a chicken and egg problem. Building up critical mass of trusted researchers required shelling out big bucks. But it was loath to open up its checkbook for people it didn\u2019t know and trust, especially a disparate and sometimes anonymous mob of teenage hackers.\u000aBug bounty startups essentially act as market makers, creating trust and liquidity so that smaller companies like Vimeo can tap into the supply of global hackers. "Paying people can be a real pain; they are all over the world, and they don\u2019t have W-9s," says Pile. HackerOne handles the legal and logistical nightmare, taking care of billing and payment in exchange for a 20 percent commission on top of each bounty.\u000aThe system is working so well that companies, which are large enough to handle their own programs, like Yahoo and Twitter, have chosen to use third-party vendors like HackerOne instead. "The band-aid approach of throwing more and more hardware and software at the problem clearly is not working. We need an orthogonal approach, and one that is proven," says Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist and investor in HackerOne. "Bug bounty programs get in front of the problem instead of just playing defense."\u000aDown with the dupes\u000aFor the bug hunters, the biggest risk is that they will invest hours in finding a flaw and writing a report that explains how it works and can be fixed, only to learn that it\u2019s already been submitted by a rival. Shashank and his friends have crafted playful memes about the heartbreak of "duplicates," as they are known in the business.\u000a"There is a huge amount of trust involved," says Vimeo\u2019s Pile. "They spend a ton of time identifying and documenting these issues, and then the report goes into a black box. I closed out a significant number that were duplicates, and unfortunately we can only pay on a first come first serve basis."\u000a"Bug bounty like online poker, I think."\u000aInterestingly, none of the half dozen researchers from bug bounty leader boards contacted by The Verge were doing this work full time. The haphazard nature made monthly earnings uneven. All referred to it as a passion, a hobby, or a part-time gig, although many said the pay was quite good when they happened to strike first. "Bug bounty like online poker I think [sic]," wrote a Russian hacker, Andrew. "You may be in luck and got a big prize [but] may be not in luck and during long time nothing to find [sic]." In a way, the robust market of researchers may be as much about outsourcing as crowdsourcing. There is a wealth of teenage talent in places like India and Pakistan willing to hunt bugs despite the risk of time wasted.\u000aDupes or low-value reports can also be a problem for the companies entering this market. "The downside of saying 'if you give us vulnerability we will give you money' is you get a lot of garbage reports," says Daniel LeCheminant, who recently launched Trello\u2019s bounty program. "In the first week and a half we have gotten 200 submissions and maybe 10 were actionable."\u000aFormer NSA operatives are getting into the bug business\u000aBecause of this inefficiency, Synack uses a much less open model. It\u2019s the best funded of the bug bounty startups, and it was founded by veterans of the NSA who spent years looking for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the government. "We are taking a different approach from these other managed bug bounty providers," says founder Jay Kaplan. "The number of people out there in developing countries eager to make even $50 can create a lot of noise." The companies that use Synack don\u2019t pay hackers, but instead pay a flat fee for the service. Synack uses a limited pool of hackers who have passed its three-tiered test, vets all the submissions, and assigns the bounties, insulating its more conservative, largely non-tech clients from the chaos.\u000aAvoiding Blowback\u000aAlex Rice, the former head of Facebook security and now CTO of HackerOne, says that most hackers will choose an official program over the black market, even if the prices are not as high. "To sell something on the black market, you have to weaponize it. That can take months. And so you have to empower the majority. They have the software skills but not the malicious intent."\u000aBut some industry experts warn that if not handled properly, this dynamic can have repercussions for the companies running the bounty programs. "The problem is companies think that bug bounties are simply something they can announce and that will be enough," Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of the security firm High-Tech Bridge,  said on his company blog . He used the example of a hacker who reports a duplicate that has not yet been patched. "Okay, if you\u2019re not interested in what we\u2019ve discovered, we\u2019ll swap our white hat for a grey / black hat and talk to someone else who may well pay us more."\u000a""When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time."\u000aGus Anagnos helped launch the bug bounty programs at Paypal and now works at Synack. "What doesn\u2019t get talked about much," he says, is the blowback from hackers who felt they didn\u2019t get enough money or that their bugs weren\u2019t disclosed in a reasonable amount of time. These hackers would often go public, creating a PR nightmare for the company involved. That leads to companies overreacting to every submission. "When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time on vulnerabilities that aren\u2019t very important," says Anagnos.\u000aThe startups who run these marketplaces have ameliorated the duplicate problem in part by awarding points that build a hacker\u2019s reputation. "They give points for your duplicate bugs," Shashank told The Verge by email. Those points add up to invitations for private bounty hunts where rewards are more plentiful and competition is less crowded. "So here we get the fruit of our duplicate bugs," Shashank says. He currently sits on the leaderboards for Bugcrowd and Crowdcurity, which highlight the top researchers of each month and all time.\u000aThese private bug hunts have benefits for both sides. "Large tech companies are comfortable with the chaos of inviting people to try and pick apart your system in public," says Casey Ellis, the CEO of Bugcrowd. "A bank, a big box retailer, they aren\u2019t built like that, they don\u2019t have the same appetite for risk." Startups that offer this service typically start companies with a private program open only to a select group of trusted hackers. Slowly, as the companies learn the ropes, that can be expanded to a more public test, or the launch of an official bounty program on the client\u2019s own website.\u000aMaking the best of a bad situation\u000aSome security professionals who were critical of the proliferation in bug bounties a few years ago have since changed their tune. "I was afraid companies would start these programs and people would put up terrible bugs and demand money for them, and companies would waste time on them while real security vulnerabilities didn\u2019t get fixed," says Dan Kaminsky. "But I\u2019m pleasantly surprised with how well they have worked in the field. There is a serious talent crunch, and programs like this help to maximize a company\u2019s ability to tap all the expertise out there."\u000a"The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."\u000aStill, the programs have plenty of skeptics who feel bug hunting is largely housekeeping that doesn't address systemic security risks. "There is a huge culture around finding the bugs so that we can patch them," says Peter Herzog, a security analyst and creator of OSSTMM. "It has more of a basis in marketing than reality. The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."\u000aHerzog points out that high-profile hacks like Sony Pictures likely originated with an employee who was compromised, not a technical flaw. "Most of the attacks that happened were done through social engineering. How are we going to start patching the people?" asks Herzog. "What\u2019s the point of looking for bugs when people are the ones downloading and installing the malware."\u000aEven the founders of these startups are quick to admit that bug bounties are no magic bullet for security woes. "It\u2019s not like you run a bug bounty program and now everything is secure," says Jacob Hansen, Crowdcurity\u2019s co-founder and CEO. "It\u2019s one item in the toolbox. You need code reviews, physical security, and employee training."\u000aBut studies of the Chrome and Firefox bounty programs have found they are cheaper than hiring full-time security researchers. "Organizations are coming to realize that the tools of the past don\u2019t scale to the way they develop applications today," says Synack\u2019s Kaplan. "Companies are pushing out code 10 times a day. To keep up with hackers you can\u2019t rely on automated approaches or occasional consultants. You need a big group with a diverse set of skills constantly probing your system for weakness."\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aGaming PCs have always been about power: their job is to do more things, more quickly. But as Intel's RealSense 3D camera, Leap Motion, and other technologies start to be integrated into laptops, gamers are starting to get not just new games to play but new ways to play them.\u000aTake Acer's Aspire V 17 Nitro, the company's well-received entry-level gaming laptop. Acer announced a new model today ahead of CES that includes RealSense, which uses a standard camera, an infrared sensor, and a laser projector to map the world in three dimensions. It's similar to Kinect in a lot of ways, and can see an amazing amount \u2014 all ten of your fingers, what's behind you, even your exact facial expressions. Acer's bundling a few apps that take advantage of the tech as a way of proving its usefulness: there's Warrior Wave, a game in which you use your hands to manipulate every aspect of your players, and a 3D-scanning app called 3DMe. They're niche uses with niche compatibility right now, but they open up a huge number of ways you might start to interact with your computer. As other manufacturers start to support RealSense, too, it's going to become a more versatile platform very quickly. (RealSense already helps power the HP Sprout , which has its own weird ideas about interaction.)\u000aOtherwise, the V Nitro is just a good-looking gaming machine. It has a 17.3-inch, 1080p display, Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and as much as 1TB of hard drive space. There are even four speakers and a Blu-ray drive \u2014 this is a media machine through and through. It's a fairly simple-looking device, really, its glowing red keyboard the only indication it's a gaming laptop.\u000aThe new V Nitro will be on sale in January. Price wasn't announced, but it'll probably sit once again near the low end of the gaming-laptop spectrum. And if you buy one, it will be watching you. And your fingers.\u000a
