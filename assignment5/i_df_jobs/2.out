aVA high-tech hotel opening in Japan will be staffed by multilingual robots\u000aThe Henn-na Hotel will open this summer in the Huis Ten Bosch theme park\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThis summer, a hotel will open in the Netherlands-themed Huis Ten Bosch amusement park in Nagasaki, Japan. It will have 72 rooms. Room fees will start at $60 per night. And it will be staffed by 10 humanoid robots.\u000aThe Henn-na Hotel's blinking and "breathing" actroids will be able to make eye contact, respond to body language, and speak fluent Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English,  The Washington Post reports . They will check in guests, carry bags, make coffee, clean rooms, and deliver laundry.\u000aHow much do you tip a robot?\u000aThe robot staff will be supplemented with a human staff...for now. At a news conference in Japan, Huis Ten Bosch president Hideo Sawada said, "In the future, we\u2019d like to have more than 90 percent of hotel services operated by robots."\u000aThe actroids aren't the only futuristic thing about the Henn-na. Guests will be able to unlock their rooms through facial recognition software, and radiation panels capable of detecting body heat will monitor and adjust room temperatures.\u000aThis isn't just some futuristic fever dream: the hotel is scheduled to open on July 17th.\u000aVerge Video: The most technologically advanced cruise ship (Top Shelf, Season 3, Ep. 4)\u000aYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and/or partners.\u000aForgot password?\u000aWe'll email you a reset link.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot username?\u000aWe'll email it to you.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot password?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aForgot username?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aAlmost done,\u000aBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\u000aAuthenticating\u000aGreat!\u000aChoose an available username to complete sign up.\u000aIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.

VActivists sue San Francisco for letting 'Google bus' use public bus stops | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aTech industry shuttles have become a symbol of  economic inequality and gentrification in San Francisco , sparking a variety of protests since  late last year . Now, activists are trying to hold city leaders accountable for letting those shuttles use public bus stops, and allowing them to operate without regard for their environmental impact on the city and its residents. A coalition of activist groups is suing the city, county, board of supervisors, the local transit agency, the shuttle companies, and Mayor Ed Lee himself, for  creating a pilot program that charges bus companies just $1 per stop and granting it a special exemption from California's environmental review law.\u000aProtesters allege preferential treatment for tech companies\u000aFrom the get-go, San Francisco protesters treated the pilot progam with scorn. When every single passenger who wants to ride a public bus has to pay $2, it might not seem fair that a entire busload of well-paid tech workers should get to ride for a single dollar per stop. It seemed that the city had found a way to legalize an illegal practice, in their eyes, by charging a token amount. (Other vehicles stopping at bus stops face hefty fines.) But the heart of this latest lawsuit is that the city may also have unfairly exempted the program from the very environmental review that might have found fault with the idea.  You can read the full complaint here .\u000aGenerally, projects that might impact residents have to undergo an environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act \u2014 the same review that the city's own public bus system is undergoing now. But the city declared the shuttle program exempt as a form of "information collection," a type of exemption usually reserved for the likes of soil and water tests. When activists filed an appeal last month, the city board of supervisors  rejected it in an 8-2 decision , so now they're hoping to make their case in court.\u000a"We know that these buses are having devastating impacts on our neighborhoods, driving up rents and evictions of long-time San Francisco residents," said Sara Shortt of SF's Housing Rights Committee, which helped file the lawsuit. "We've protested in the streets and taken our plea to City Hall to no avail. We hope to finally receive justice in a court of law,"  she told the SF Examiner.\u000a

aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Star Wars movies are coming to smartphones. All six movies \u2014 yes, even The Phantom Menace, unfortunately \u2014 will be launched on digital video services such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Instant Video, and Xbox Video around the world on April 10th,  Disney and Lucasfilm announced today . The launch will allow fans to buy Digital HD versions of the movies individually, or get them all at once as part of the Star Wars Digital Movie Collection.\u000aThe six movies each come with bonus features, including documentaries, interviews with production staff, deleted scenes, and closer looks at the films' models and sets. Some digital retailers are also offering extra incentives to buy the movies from their marketplace \u2014 get the entire collection  from Xbox Video and you'll earn a digital R2-D2 to accompany your creepy, blank-faced Xbox Live avatar, a pinball table for the free-to-play Pinball FX 2, and access to an Xbox-only featurette.\u000aBuy the collection on Xbox Video to earn an imaginary R2-D2\u000aA number of digital retailers have yet to specify the price for the collection, but the whole bundle is available for $89 on the Google Play store, with individual movies going for $19.99. There were  rumors last year that Disney was planning to re-release the original Star Wars movies on Blu-ray without George Lucas' CGI spot-welding, but viewers don't appear to be able to choose which version of the movie they want to watch with the upcoming Digital HD editions. Purchasers of the new versions will have to cope with unconvincing Dewbacks, Han having the gall to step on Jabba's tail, and the disconcerting sight of a moody Hayden Christensen as Vader's ghost at the Endor feast. At least they'll be in high resolution.\u000aVerge Video: Star Wars- Episode VII adds new cast and Millenium Falcon\u000a

aV23andMe plans to move beyond genetic testing to making drugs\u000aAmbitious goals, but no diseases or drug targets in sight\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aGenetic testing company 23andMe wants to use the vast amounts of genetic data it has gathered over the last few years to start making drugs, according to Bloomberg . Instead of focusing on screening people for various diseases, the company plans to make therapeutic agents that will target these diseases and possibly cure them. It's a pretty big departure for the company that failed to get FDA approval for its DNA testing kit and that only just received FDA clearance to sell a test that looks for markers of Bloom Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that's associated with sun sensitivity and increased cancer risk.\u000a23andMe has yet to pick the diseases or drug targets that it would like to work on.  In fact, it's still deciding if it wants to strike out on its own or partner with pharmaceutical companies to run its trials.\u000a"Pharma companies don\u2019t have a direct relationship with consumers."\u000aThe genetic testing company already has partnerships with pharmaceutical companies like  Pfizer Inc. and Genentech. They use the company's genetic databases to conduct research for their medicines. Thus, if 23andMe dives into the drug-making business, it will find itself competing with its partners. The company's relationships with Big Pharma won't be affected by the change, according to 23andMe President Andy Page, who spoke with Bloomberg. But CEO Anne Wojcicki says the company could make drug development more efficient.\u000a"Pharma companies don\u2019t have a direct relationship with consumers, so they\u2019re always subjects," she said. "By engaging them and giving it to them as a prize, saying, \u2018You\u2019ve powered this study, and you\u2019ve made this happen,\u2019 we can do things in a different way."\u000aThe former head of research and early development at Genentech, Richard Scheller, will lead 23andMe's therapeutics group. This spring, the company will try to raise money to fund the new enterprise. Since 2006, 23andMe has raised $126 million in funding.\u000a"With an FDA-cleared product, we need to continue to accelerate growth," Wojcicki said. "I want to push the limits."\u000a

VAlcatel's new flagship smartphones have high-end features, low-end prices | The Verge

aVAlcatel's new flagship smartphones have high-end features, low-end prices\u000aAnd they're coming to the US\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIf you're familiar with the name Alcatel Onetouch at all, you probably associate it with low-end phones that aren't particularly exciting. Those low-end phones have been the company's bread and butter here in the US, and have helped it move up the rankings of smartphone makers. With the new Idol 3, a high-end smartphone being announced at Mobile World Congress today, Alcatel is looking to change that perception.\u000aThe Idol 3 is actually a pair of smartphones: a larger, 5.5.-inch model, and a smaller, 4.7-inch version. Both of the phones share many characteristics and features, but the 5.5-inch Idol 3 has a full 1080p display compared to the 4.7's 720p panel, a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor (the 4.7 has a quad-core Snapdragon 400 series chip), larger battery, and more RAM and internal storage. Both have 13-megapixel rear cameras with wide-aperture lenses and LED flashes. The 5.5-inch model has an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, while the 4.7-inch version makes do with a 5-megapixel front camera. The phones have dual front-facing speakers powered by JBL, and interestingly, two microphones, so you can pick up the phone in any orientation and answer a call. Both phones are sleek and slim (about 7.5mm thick), and could easily be mistaken for a better known brand.\u000aThe Idol 3 will sell for under $250 unlocked in the US\u000aBut perhaps the most interesting part of the Idol 3 is that Alcatel is selling them in the US, and for not a lot of money. The 5.5-inch model will sell for under $250, while the 4.7-inch Idol 3 will go for under $200. Both will be sold unlocked through Alcatel's web store in the US and support LTE on either AT&T or T-Mobile. The Idol 3 is the first flagship phone that Alcatel is bringing to the US\u000aThere are lots of phones flooding the market at ultra-low price points, many of which bring along rather impressive design and user experiences. But the pair of Alcatel phones are notable in that they don't look like cheap smartphones at all. Even the Motorola Moto G and Moto E , both of which are great inexpensive phones in their own rights, mostly look the part. In contrast, the Alcatel's have bright, laminated displays with great viewing angles (which Alcatel says was tuned by Technicolor), fast performance, loud speakers, and clean, attractive designs. Most of those features have been reserved for high-end, expensive smartphones until now. The Idol 3 units I saw don't quite hit the high marks set by HTC and Apple when it comes to build quality, but when you can get three 5.5-inch Idol 3s for the cost of one iPhone 6 Plus, it's easy to excuse that.\u000aThe Idol 3 runs Android 5.0.2 Lollipop with Alcatel's slightly-customized user interface. There's a daily digest pane to the left of the main homescreen that displays weather, calendar appointments, news headlines, and more. It reminds me of HTC's BlinkFeed. The Onetouch Mix app lets you mix two songs together from music stored on the device or streamed from Rdio, complete with faders and scratching. It's neat, if not quite an app that most people will use very often.\u000aCheap phones are getting really good\u000aThere's plenty of room for criticism on Alcatel's new phones: they copy other devices' sizes, they copy some software features, they copy some hardware features, etc. But the fact of the matter is none of that really matters. Copycat or not, inexpensive phones are getting really, really good, and that benefits everyone who buys smartphones, whether you're willing to pay $250 or $750 for one.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VAlfred turns your iPad or iPhone into a remote control for your Mac | The Verge
p17
aVAlfred turns your iPad or iPhone into a remote control for your Mac\u000aAnother power tool for power users\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aA new app  available in the iOS App Store today will let you configure your iPhone or iPad as a kind of supercharged remote control for your Mac. Called  Alfred Remote , it essentially offers you multiple panels of buttons to do things like launch apps, control iTunes, turn on your screen saver, perform custom searches, paste text snippets, and do much nerdier things if you put your mind to it. It's $4.99, and it's designed to be paired with Alfred for the Mac, a free app with an in-app upgrade of £17 (around $25 US).\u000aPowerful, but only if you configure it\u000aI've long  been an apologist for Alfred , a Mac utility that lets you supercharge a text box into something that can control your entire computer and connect it to the web in surprising and interesting ways. It's a tool that initially looks like a nerdy version of Yosemite's Spotlight search feature until you start digging in, where you'll find customizable clipboards and workflows that let you do insane, powerful things. It's not the easiest thing to configure, but if you take some time with it, it's great.\u000aI've been using Alfred Remote for a few days now, and while I'm impressed by its stability and functionality, I'm not sure that it will become as essential to my workflow as the main Mac app. With Alfred Remote, you get a pre-configured set of shortcuts and system commands that seem to work as if by magic, immediately and instantly causing your Mac to do things.\u000aBut whether Alfred Remote succeeds or fails for you depends entirely on whether you take the time to configure more "things" for your Mac to do. The basics of launching apps and even pasting pre-configured text snippets by tapping a button on your iPad seem whiz-bang the first time, but then only marginally better than using the keyboard commands that are already literally at your fingertips when you're using a Mac. Given that you need to have your iPad or iPhone on, unlocked, and in the app, it can seem a little silly. And unless you're already an Alfred power user on the Mac, you probably won't find much utility in it.\u000aBut then I started thinking of things that are a pain to do on my Mac, and Alfred Remote started to make more sense. I have a couple dozen text snippets I use constantly but can never remember the short cuts for them. I have a dozen more complicated "Workflows" that perform complex searches and actions in very specific apps. I have a bunch of Applescripts that I can never seem to find quickly enough. I never remember to lock my stupid computer when I walk away from it. I definitely lost hours of my Sunday playing around with ideas for buttons that could do magic things on my Mac.\u000aWith varying levels of difficulty, Alfred Remote can be set up for all of that. Unfortunately, at the nerdier end of the spectrum you will need to figure out a fairly complex interface to get it done. Alfred's most powerful features are called "Workflows," which let you string together different commands by drawing lines and adding scripts. They're cool, but they require a power user mindset that isn't quite in keeping with the simplicity of the iOS App Store. You can create your own workflows or dive into  Alfred's forums (or a new repository for them called  Packal ). Alfred suggested a couple \u2014 for controlling Spotify or Powerpoint \u2014 but eventually I just decided to start making my own. You can't enter text into Alfred Remote; you can only set up buttons that do specific tasks. That can make for a steep learning curve to climb, and the benefits of doing so are either immediately obvious or shrug-inducing, without much between those two extremes.\u000aI love Alfred on the Mac so much that I've reconfigured my Caps Lock key to launch it instead of making uppercase letters. I haven't yet decided if I love Alfred Remote enough to put it on my iPad's home screen. Maybe if I spend more time configuring it, I'll know. If there's anything Alfred knows, it's that power users spend as much time obsessing about their tools as they do actually using them.\u000a

He looks out his sizable bedroom window and across his swelling, well-manicured grounds while thinking about his saltwater pool. It's so big. Bigger than most pools. Maybe he will go swimming today. He turns around and notices a man lying in his bed. A beautiful man, with pristine facial hair and a thick neck. He looks closer at the man. Poreless. He touches the man's skin and feels a hand on his own face. This man is him. This man is Drake.\u000aScene 1: Drake and Drake get margaritas\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aJun 6, 2013 at 4:32pm PDT\u000aDrake is thirsty, so Drake and Drake decide to go get drinks. They go to a T.G.I.Friday's because Drake appreciates the taxidermy on the walls and empathizes with the crowds of office drones eating spinach dip at 11AM.\u000aDRAKE: Have you ever noticed the propensity of all humankind to categorically sabotage the very essence of the particularities and idiosyncrasies that make us truly unique? It muddles the mind. "Personality is only ripe when a man has made the truth his own." I think Kierkegaard said that.\u000aDRAKE: He did say that. Do you want to split the BBQ wrap?\u000aScene 2: Drake and Drake wear Drake shirts\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aFeb 26, 2014 at 11:54am PST\u000aDrake and Drake have successfully gotten drunk on the sweet and salty faux-marg orgy offered on the T.G.I.Friday's menu, so they decide to celebrate their joint existence with matching t-shirts.\u000aDRAKE: These shirts are great. You look great, Drake. I look okay.\u000aDRAKE: I sometimes wonder about the inescapable futility of bespoke clothing, and how, rather than arming us with the tools we need to combat an ever-aggressive capitalist society, they merely subdue us into a state of mimed complacency. But no, you look better than okay.\u000aScene 3: One of the Drakes finds love\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aMay 17, 2014 at 12:15pm PDT\u000aOne of the Drakes meets a woman while out on a morning jog. She jogs alongside him. They are fluid; perfectly in sync. They fall in love. Love shrinks Drake's world, and his time spent with other Drake becomes more and more infrequent.\u000aDRAKE: I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 you could do better. Tell me have you heard that lately? Additionally, have you ever considered that love is a deranged experiment created by corporate slogs to see just how much unending torture the human brain can endure?\u000aDRAKE: But I love you, Drake. That's not an experiment.\u000aScene 4: The Drakes have a falling out, and then a reunion\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aApr 30, 2013 at 12:06pm PDT\u000aThe Drakes are getting ready for bed. Drake is reading Elena Ferrante's The Days of Abandonment. Drake is still in love, but he's worried about Drake. Other Drake is moody and cold.\u000aDRAKE: I love how Ferrante uses gendered diffusion of responsibility and the trappings of mental fragility without ever rendering her protagonist a pitiful caricature of female struggle. Perhaps you should be more like Ferrante, Drake.\u000aDRAKE: I would like you to consider the possibility that you may be overreacting.\u000aDRAKE: And I would like you to consider the possibility that there is no stronger bond than ours. No intangible feeling of sensuality and companionship can usurp our core design of sameness. I love you, and I'm going to bed.\u000aDRAKE: Goodnight, sleep well. Don't let the absurdity and meaninglessness of life deprive you of the satisfaction and joy which inexplicably arise nevertheless.\u000aThis has been A Tale of Two Drakes: fan fiction inspired by the  Drake Twins Instagram account .\u000aVerge Video: McLaren's "low-end" 570s is incredible\u000a

VAcer Chromebook 15 review: the big Chromebook has arrived | The Verge
p29
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSay the word \u201cChromebook,\u201d and the image that comes to mind for most people is a small, cheap, basic computer. That\u2019s exactly what most Chromebooks are. The best Chromebooks you can buy have 11- or 12-inch displays, are priced well under $400, and do basic web browsing and not much more.\u000aBut the reality of the matter is that most people looking for a cheap laptop don\u2019t want an 11- or 12-inch model. The vast majority of computers purchased in the $400\u2013$600 range have big 15.6-inch displays. And they run Windows. Even though Chromebooks have long been billed as the computers for \u201ceverybody,\u201d they haven\u2019t been the computers for most people .\u000aThat\u2019s starting to change, however, as Google\u2019s Chromebook partners are beginning to embrace the larger Chromebook. Last year, one of the most popular models on the market was HP\u2019s Chromebook 14 , an arguably terrible option with poor build quality and a lousy display whose only saving grace was that it was big. Now Acer is launching the Chromebook 15, the first Chromebook with an even bigger 15.6-inch display. It goes right for the heart of the cheap Windows laptop market: the giant hulks of laptops priced around $400\u2013$500 that fill Best Buy and Walmart\u2019s shelves.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 actually starts at $249, a significantly lower price than most Windows laptops. But that rock bottom price comes with a low-res 1366 x 768 pixel display, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. For the past couple of weeks, I\u2019ve been using the $349.99 model, which steps up to a 1080p display, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. It\u2019s powered by a dual-core Intel Celeron processor \u2014 a real laptop chip, as opposed to the lower-power mobile processors used in other Chromebooks. I strongly recommend ponying up for the more expensive model; the increased screen resolution and added RAM make for a much better experience. And even with those upgrades, the Chromebook 15 still falls under the price of the average entry level Windows notebook.\u000aThe Chromebook 15's most defining feature is its most obvious\u000aThe Chromebook 15\u2019s most defining feature is its most obvious: it\u2019s big! In fact, it\u2019s bigger than the 15-inch MacBook Pro I use as my daily workhorse. It\u2019s kind of clunky, kind of chunky, pretty ugly, and the white textured finish on my review unit doesn\u2019t do any favors to hide its bulky dimensions. (Acer is also selling a black model, which is definitely more pleasing on the eyes.) That makes it difficult to use on the go: it barely fit on my lap during my commute on the train to the office, and forget about fitting this thing on the seatback tray of an economy seat on an airplane. The all-plastic Chromebook 15 also weighs nearly five pounds, which is practically an anvil in the Chromebook world and is even heavier than my aluminum MacBook Pro.\u000aBut none of those things really matter if your computer sits on a desk for the majority of its life. Instead, the big dimensions of the Chromebook 15 prove to be an asset here: the screen is 27 percent larger than a 13.3-inch Chromebook, the keyboard is full-sized and spacious, the trackpad is the biggest you can get on a Chromebook, and there are two big, loud speakers on the deck that pump tunes straight up, instead of to the side or off of another surface. It doesn\u2019t skimp on ports or connectivity either: there\u2019s a USB 3.0 port, a USB 2.0 port, an HDMI port, a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, and support for 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks. For someone that\u2019s going to buy a basic computer for simple tasks and leave it on a desk the vast majority of the time, those are all attractive features.\u000aThe 1080p display won\u2019t impress anyone used to the color-rich, high-res panels on MacBook Pros or high-end Windows ultrabooks. But it\u2019s adequately bright, has acceptable viewing angles, and has a matte finish with virtually no glare, which is really easy on the eyes. It also doesn\u2019t suffer from the graininess or harsh colors often seen on other Chromebooks. Aziz Ansari\u2019s latest Netflix special didn\u2019t look great \u2014 his black suit and the dark backgrounds on the stage were various shades of dark grey instead of black \u2014 but the jokes were no less funny on the Chromebook 15 than they were when I watched it on my plasma TV. The extra screen real estate afforded by the 1080p resolution also lets me put two browser windows side by side, proving that you can actually multitask with a Chromebook. It lacks a touchscreen, but Chrome OS\u2019 support for touch is still nascent, and I don\u2019t miss having one.\u000aThe chiclet keyboard is quiet and comfortable to type on, as opposed to the slippery and noisy keyboards on other Chromebooks I\u2019ve used. Its travel is shallower than my MacBook Pro\u2019s, which isn\u2019t much of a surprise, but it isn\u2019t fatiguing to use. The only thing it\u2019s missing is backlighting, but you\u2019ll have to step up to the thousand-dollar Chromebook Pixel to get that on a Chrome OS computer.\u000aThe trackpad is far better than what you expect from a $350 computer\u000aLike the keyboard, the spacious trackpad is actually a joy to use. For some reason (Google says it\u2019s thanks to the Pixel), Chromebooks have been racing ahead of their Windows counterparts in trackpad performance, and the Chromebook 15\u2019s trackpad is fast, responsive, and arguably the best trackpad you\u2019ll find on a computer in this price range. It\u2019s got just the right amount of friction to make multi-touch gestures like two-finger scrolling work effortlessly, and it never caused my cursor to jump around erratically. Its low-cost roots are betrayed by the cheap clacking sound it makes when you depress it, but that didn\u2019t hinder its functionality in any meaningful way. To beat this trackpad, you pretty much have to step up to a MacBook Air (or the aforementioned Chromebook Pixel). It\u2019s that good.\u000aThe worst part of most cheap computers is their laggy, slow performance when you\u2019re just trying to check Facebook or pay a bill. A lot of Windows laptops and a number of other Chromebooks (especially models with fanless, mobile processors) are frustrating in this regard. The Chromebook 15 doesn\u2019t have this problem: as I\u2019m typing this review, I have 22 tabs open across two windows, plus another window running the Sunrise calendar Chrome app, and it\u2019s not breaking a sweat \u2014 the fans aren\u2019t even on. It\u2019s actually disheartening to say that Chrome OS on this $350 computer runs as well as the Chrome browser does on my $2,500 MacBook Pro, but performance has not been an issue the entire time I\u2019ve been using the Chromebook 15. (It also demonstrates how badly Chrome runs on OS X, but that\u2019s a complaint for another time.) Pages load quickly, scrolling is smooth even on resource-heavy sites like ESPN\u2019s front page, and there\u2019s no lag when moving windows or tabs around. Chrome OS is still mostly just a browser, but it sure feels like more than that when I think of all the things I\u2019ve been able to get done on the Chromebook 15.\u000aIt\u2019s obvious that the Chromebook 15\u2019s main purpose is to sit on a desk and stay there, but if you do need to move it around and work unplugged, the battery life is actually pretty great. It lasted 11 hours and 32 minutes on our rundown test \u2014 significantly more than the 9 hours that Acer claims. In real-world use, it consistently goes for 7 to 8 hours between charges, which is well above the usual 3 to 4 hours you get from entry level Windows laptops.\u000aFor years, I\u2019ve been recommending Chromebooks to people looking for a simple, inexpensive computer to do day-to-day tasks, only to be shut down when I suggest a model with an 11- or 12-inch display. There are other reasons stopping people from picking up Chromebooks: networked printer support is abysmal, and if you have a large library of music, the tiny SSDs and 100GB of Google Drive storage aren\u2019t going to get it done. But the Chromebook 15 addresses the number one roadblock for most people: screen size. It also offers many of the features that make other Chromebooks so desirable: fast, simple operation, a great trackpad, and a low sticker price.\u000aI rely too much on desktop apps to make the Chromebook 15 my main computer, but for a lot of people looking for an inexpensive machine to pay the bills, do the occasional video call, and browse Facebook, it\u2019s more than sufficient. And it has the big screen that so many of them are looking for.\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is the exact opposite of Apple's new MacBook\u000aThe Chromebook 15 is pretty much the exact opposite of Apple\u2019s new MacBook or Google\u2019s new Chromebook Pixel: it\u2019s big, chunky, has more than one port, and is pretty ugly to boot. It\u2019s also about a quarter of the price. But if the MacBook and the Pixel \u2014 expensive, technological tours de force with golden and aluminum finishes \u2014 represent the future of laptop computers, the Chromebook 15 represents the computer of today. It\u2019s the laptop for the average person that values price over design or portability, but also doesn\u2019t want to put up with the lousy, frustrating experience so often associated with cheap computers.\u000aIt may sound counterintuitive, especially if you focus on the bleeding edge of laptop technology, but the biggest Chromebook yet arguably had a real chance of becoming a success in the mass-market, entry-level laptop world. It\u2019s not the computer for people who work all day on a laptop, or for people who are constantly on the road. But for a lot of other people, the Chromebook 15 offers the size they are looking for without the headaches of entry-level Windows computers. There\u2019s your revolution.\u000aPhotography by Sean O'Kane\u000a

aVTech\u000a12 Monkeys television series will synchronize with Hue home lighting\u000aSyfy\u2019s original series is the first with a 'light track' that adjusts room lighting to on-screen action\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOwners of Philips Hue light bulbs will have the chance to experience something rather unique with the premiere of  12 Monkeys on Friday, January 16th. The Syfy original drama based upon the 1995 Terry Gilliam film will feature a "light track" that marries the action on the screen to the lighting in your room. Not just once, but for the entirety of the 13-episode season.\u000aThis isn\u2019t the first collaboration between Syfy and Philips. Sharknado 2 also  featured live synchronized Hue lighting when it premiered in July.\u000aThe transmedia lighting experience is controlled by the Syfy Sync app which connects to the Hue bridge and translates audio cues into web-enabled lighting commands. The result is room lighting that helps strike the right mood, with bulbs changing colors to better immerse the viewer in the on-screen action, akin to the effect achieved by those Philips-branded  Ambilight televisions that always look neat but few people buy.\u000aYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and/or partners.\u000aForgot password?\u000aWe'll email you a reset link.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot username?\u000aWe'll email it to you.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot password?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aForgot username?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aAlmost done,\u000aBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\u000aAuthenticating\u000aGreat!\u000aChoose an available username to complete sign up.\u000aIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.
