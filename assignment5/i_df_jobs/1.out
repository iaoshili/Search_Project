V10 things you can buy instead of a $10,000 Apple Watch | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Apple Watch Edition is certainly a fine-looking smartwatch, but with a starting price of $10,000 , it's worth looking at what else that amount of money can buy to put in perspective how much it costs. Let's remember: this is a watch that will likely be out of date within a matter of years, quickly depreciate in value, and is available in equally capable and similarly stylish models for just $1,000 \u2014 even less if you're willing to deal with those plebeian sport bands!

VA closer look at Project Spartan, Microsoft's Internet Explorer killer | The Verge
p8
aVA closer look at Project Spartan, Microsoft's Internet Explorer killer\u000aThe future is here\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Spartan army was the centrepiece of an ancient Greek city-state that grew into a powerful military land-power in roughly 650 BC. Today, Microsoft is putting Spartan, its new browser, at the center of Windows 10 to slay off the old, weak, and beleaguered Internet Explorer.\u000aMicrosoft might not be fully killing off Internet Explorer the app, but a new brand name will herald a new era for the company\u2019s browser prospects and a signal to web developers that Internet Explorer will soon be part of ancient history.\u000aProject Spartan is just a codename for now, but I\u2019ve had a chance to experience Microsoft\u2019s new browser in Windows 10, the successor to Internet Explorer.\u000aA new look and feel\u000aThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about Project Spartan is just how basic and minimalist it looks. Part of that might be because it\u2019s lacking all the final features, but it\u2019s mainly because Microsoft is clearly thinking about stripping this back for the modern era. While Internet Explorer 11 is basic itself, Spartan builds upon that by hiding away features like Reading List and the settings panel behind modern icons. There\u2019s buttons to access favorites, reading view, a new Web Notes feature, and a section for reading list, favorites management, history, and the download manager. It\u2019s all based on a sliding sidebar, and it feels like the right way to access features and settings.\u000aSpartan\u2019s interface is rather basic for now, and there\u2019s no sign of any extra clever tab management just yet, but that\u2019s part of its appeal. The address bar and tabs are where you\u2019d expect to find them, and everything feels like it\u2019s staying out of the way to let you surf the web. That feeling is very similar to how I felt using the modern IE in Windows 8.1, but Spartan doesn\u2019t go far enough just yet. Disappointingly, there\u2019s no immersive fullscreen experience that\u2019s optimized for touch, and it feels a little clunky navigating with your fingers. I\u2019m hopeful that Microsoft is simply working to bring this in future updates, because it would be a mistake to lose that great finger-friendly browsing experience from Windows 8.1 for tablets.\u000aSpartan looks a little spartan\u000aAs this is only a very early preview, performance isn\u2019t great. Scrolling and opening new tabs can be laggy and random, and I noticed you can\u2019t double click the title bar to maximize Spartan. These issues will obviously be worked out ready for the final release, but it\u2019s worth noting in case you\u2019re thinking about using Windows 10 and Spartan day to day. It\u2019s not ready for daily use just yet.\u000aInking and annotation\u000aThe most impressive new feature for me personally is the inking and annotation support. Microsoft originally demonstrated this by drawing all over a Verge article back in January, and it was the first thing I decided to test. If you\u2019re using something like the Surface Pro 3 with a stylus, you can simply hit the Web Note button and start inking all over a webpage. There are options to change the ink color, highlighting tools, a way to add comment notes, and even a snippet tool. It\u2019s a fun experience, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel it would be even more fun and useful if you could ink in real-time with others.\u000aOnce you\u2019re done drawing all over a webpage, you can share it via email, upload it to OneDrive, or store it in OneNote. Not all of these sharing options are enabled just yet, but Microsoft is planning to support them in the final version of Project Spartan. This seems to be the big selling point of Spartan, and the inking will also work without a stylus on a touchscreen machine or by using a mouse. Everyone will be able to draw on the web with Windows 10.\u000aCortana integration\u000aCortana integration is the second key feature in Project Spartan. While Windows 10 has Cortana built in for search, the digital assistant gets a little more clever in the browser. You can right-click on words on a website and Cortana will find search results for them, and the digital assistant will even automatically find driving directions to a store or restaurant if you\u2019re browsing a particular site. If you visit Cuoco\u2019s website, an Italian restaurant in Seattle, Cortana pops up near the address bar with suggestions for opening hours and driving directions. It\u2019s a neat trick.\u000aCortana in the browser has a few neat tricks\u000aCortana also works in the address bar when you\u2019re searching. If you start typing "weather," it will automatically surface local weather straight in the address bar, alongside information on stocks. Microsoft is also adding in the ability to see flight information in there in future, and you can imagine there are many more scenarios where you might want to see quick information without hitting enter for full search results. The Cortana integration is welcome, and I\u2019d like to see more of this in future updates.\u000aReading List and Reading View\u000aWhile Reading View was part of the Modern IE in Windows 8.1, Microsoft is bringing it to the desktop fully with Spartan and Windows 10. It\u2019s very similar to before, and provides a stripped-back reading experience that\u2019s ideal on a tablet or laptop. I found that it doesn\u2019t always work on every page, particularly large ones or ones with a lot of imagery, but it\u2019s ideally suited for article pages, and it declutters everything to focus on the text.\u000aReading List is a new addition that syncs URLs between devices and provides a way to read PDFs or webpages offline. It\u2019s not fully enabled in the preview just yet, but it will work similar to the Reading List app for Windows 8.1. I\u2019ve found that Reading List works well if you\u2019re browsing a site on your phone and want to transfer it quickly over to your PC, and it\u2019s a feature that Apple already has in Safari.\u000aA new rendering engine\u000aPerhaps the biggest change to Spartan that you won\u2019t really notice is a new rendering engine. Microsoft is moving away from the complexity and legacy of Internet Explorer, and it\u2019s starting fresh with Project Spartan. The new Edge rendering engine is designed to be modern, so there\u2019s no support for ActiveX controls and rendered pages should be a lot more compatible thanks to more standards compliancy. I\u2019ve found that some pages don\u2019t render well at the moment, and it has a few quirks here and there, but it\u2019s preview so these kinks will likely be ironed out by the time Spartan ships in the summer.\u000aOne impressive thing I've noticed is the small amount of RAM usage for tabs. It's usually less than the same site in Internet Explorer, so once the performance issues are fixed this could be a very fast and bloat-free browser.\u000aExtensions and the future\u000aExtensions are still missing right now, and that\u2019s a big miss for Spartan. Microsoft is making a number of good steps, but to truly compete with Chrome it needs good extensions support. Microsoft was slow to implement tabs back in the Internet Explorer days, and it feels like the company is once again dragging its feet. While you could argue extensions are a niche function, they matter to a lot of people who spend their life in the browser. However, Microsoft has committed to bringing extensions to Project Spartan, and we\u2019re hoping to hear more about them at the company\u2019s Build conference next month. It\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll be ready for the summer ship time though.\u000aThe future of Project Spartan looks bright. Microsoft is taking a step away from the  Internet Explorer legacy , and the initial preview seems promising. The key to Spartan\u2019s future will be how quickly Microsoft can adapt its rendering engine and provide updates to consumers running Windows 10. Google has set the standard here with regular Chrome updates, and Microsoft really needs to follow that pace if it wants to catch up and push Spartan into the future.\u000a

VA tiny startup has made big strides in creating self-navigating drones | The Verge
p11
aVA tiny startup has made big strides in creating self-navigating drones\u000aVeterans of Google X and MIT have created some remarkable computer vision systems\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSome of the biggest news out of CES this year was the huge progress companies have made on technology that can help drones be aware of their surroundings , allowing them to sense objects and avoid collisions. Those breakthroughs were powered by well-established drone companies like Ascending Technologies and semiconductor giants like Intel. Earlier this week, in a small park along the San Francisco Bay, I got to see another take on "sense and avoid." It came from a small startup,  Skydio , and it was as impressive as anything I saw from the titans of tech.\u000aSkydio was created by three friends who met at MIT. Adam Bry and Abe Bachrach were in the robust robotics program, researching ways to build aircraft that could fly themselves without GPS, culminating in a fixed wing drone with a laser range finder that autonomously navigated its way around a parking lot. After that, Adam and Abe were part of the founding team for Google X\u2019s Project Wing , designing and building the delivery drone that flew over Australia.\u000aAfter a year and a half, the pair left Google X and along with Matt Donahoe, who they met at MIT\u2019s Media Lab, set out to create a system to power self-navigating drones using only the commodity chips and and sensors you would find in your average smartphone. Today Skydio, which has been working in stealth for around a year, announced a $3 million round of funding from Andreessen Horowitz and Accel.\u000aRight now most drones stabilize themselves using GPS and some can even use that signal to navigate a course or follow you around. But they are helpless if they lose GPS and also can\u2019t see trees on a ski slope and know to avoid them when they following you to film. Powerful sense and avoid would make drones safer by giving them the ability to correct for bad pilots. It would also make autonomous flight more robust, allowing drones to avoid obstacles. Without it, the fantasy of a delivery drone landing on your lawn would remain just that.\u000a"The goal is to take something that normally costs $5,000 and sell it for $50."\u000aAt CES we saw the beginnings of this, using powerful, expensive sensors custom built by Intel. Skydio is betting that they can achieve robust sense and avoid using only ordinary cameras, instead of the lasers, sonar, and depth of field cameras we saw at CES. "The goal is to take something that normally costs $5,000 and sell it for $50," says Bry, the CEO. "We think vision is going to win the day. It\u2019s an incredibly rich data source, it\u2019s just algorithmically challenging. But computers are getting faster and these algos are coming into place."\u000aSkydio gave us a demo of their drone, a prototype quadcopter with two small cameras feeding a video stream into a small Intel media center. The unit had no GPS, which is how a normal drone would orient itself, but after takeoff it hovered completely in place, holding its position as well as or better than any drone I\u2019ve seen. "It\u2019s doing that 100% based on the visual it has of us standing here," Donahoe explained.\u000aThe first demo Donahoe walked me through was called the "Magic Wand." You point your phone at the drone, which is connected to it over Wi-Fi. Tap to initiate control, then move your arm in any direction and the drone will move as well, pivoting to keep you in focus. It worked remarkably well and had a much simpler interface than any of the "follow me" drones I tested at CES.\u000aRight now a bulky controller is the command prompt of drones\u000a"Right now this is the command prompt on a drone," said Bry, hefting the RC flight controller, with its two joysticks and multitude of buttons and switches. "If you\u2019re an expert operator, and you\u2019re trained, you can get really incredible photos and video. We want to find a way to deliver that same power, but in a much more intuitive way that is open to anyone with a smartphone."\u000aSince it\u2019s based on computer vision, Skydio\u2019s system would struggle to work under poor lighting conditions or in weather like rain and snow. "It\u2019s kind of intuitive," said Bachrach. "If a person watching the video would have difficulty figuring out what\u2019s going on, then the software probably would as well."\u000a"It will seem crazy that a drone would ever crash."\u000aI asked the Skydio team how good the system would have to be in order to be commercially viable. A drone that only crashes one in 10,000 times? One in a million? "Realistically the first systems won\u2019t be perfect," says Bry. "But right now there is nothing available to the average consumer. Something is better than nothing."\u000aThe idea is to use sense and avoid technology initially as a redundant safety feature that helps pilots avoid obstacles. As it gets better\u2014 and assuming the FAA allows the consumer drone trend to continue \u2014 it will be employed in more autonomous situations, like filming your kid on the soccer field or checking out a leaky roof to see what needs a fix. "It\u2019s going to be a very long term project to make a perfect, robust system, but I think in five or six years you will just trust the unit," says Bry. "It can see the world and know where it needs to move or land to avoid problems. It will seem crazy that a drone would ever crash."\u000aAccel is also an investor in Vox Media, parent company of The Verge.\u000a

aVAll cannabis startup parties should be like this cannabis startup party\u000aFlowers everywhere, flowers in her hair\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aFlow Kana is a new San Francisco-based, on-demand cannabis delivery service that sources marijuana from small farmers in California. The Bay Area is already  blessed with a growing number of apps that deliver weed to your door, but Flow Kana claims it gives farmers much better margins. On Thursday, the startup invited me to a launch party at an undisclosed location in the Berkeley hills. Flow Kana was promising hors d\u2019oeuvres and drinks "paired with curated \u2018intermezzos\u2019 of cannabis treats and boutique flowers." Finally, a product I want to unbox!\u000aThe invite also pledged to teach us more about the burgeoning "clean cannabis" movement. (Don\u2019t bother Googling it, the movement hasn\u2019t made its way online.) Flow Kana CEO Michael Steinmetz uses the term to mean organic, sustainably grown pot, delivered "farm to table," if your table is where you keep your bong. He says Flow Kana \u2014 which is currently invitation-only \u2014 will also have "almost zero carbon footprint," because its couriers will tool around San Francisco on bicycles carrying jars filled with an eighth of a pound of weed from every partnering farm.\u000aFarm-to-table marijuana\u000aFlow Kana\u2019s party invitation called for formal dress: "Great Gatsby meets California." I was coming from work, though, and ended up closer to "Urban Outfitters catalog meets Pennsylvania." And for a weed party, getting there was no chill sitch. Guests had to catch a shuttle from a UC Berkeley parking lot, located 20 minutes from the nearest BART station. As soon as the shuttle driver began our rickety ride ascent up a very narrow road, a pre-recorded message about Flow Kana started blasting on speakers. The backing instrumentals recalled the tuning of a violin.\u000aI recognized Steinmetz\u2019s voice by his Venezuelan accent. With legalization on the horizon, his voiceover intoned, it\u2019s critical to ask ourselves the "important questions," such as "Who is going to grow my cannabis, and with what values?" Not my first question, but sure!\u000aThe mystery location was  a house made of redwood trees . Flow Kana staffers stood helpfully on either side of the road to make sure we didn\u2019t wander into the wrong organic mansion. A woman wearing a crown of flowers welcomed us inside. Later, she and the other "flower girls" would pass around wooden trays covered with joints rolled into such symmetrical cylinders I thought they were taffy.\u000aThe view from the top of the hill made me forget how I got there. As did the house itself. I made my way through the corridor festooned with pillows and the swag table covered in mini-succulents for guests to take home.\u000aFlower girls holding perfect joints\u000aI struck up a conversation with Stephen, the lithe middle-aged black gentleman perched next to me, who turned out to be the owner of the house. He said it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s protégé Daniel Lieberman, who built it to mimic the structure of an open umbrella. The steel poles in the center that went down hundreds of feet into the bedrock were the umbrella shaft. The umbrella spokes, canopy, and the slats of the railing were all made of redwood. "They can\u2019t even get that stuff anymore," he said, pointing to a beam that extended the length of two floors.\u000a"Must\u2019ve cost a lot," I hinted, hoping to get an exact price. "Uh, yeah," he replied, casually surveying his indoor forrest. "Anytime you spend millions \u2026"\u000aWhat did he do when he wasn\u2019t keeping an eye on startup parties? "I\u2019m launching a private social network called The Karma Society," said Stephen. It\u2019s for world travelers who need recommendations in other cities. He described it as "like Facebook, but more of a high-end Vogue / GQ Facebook."\u000aMany of the guests adhered to the Gatsby theme, or were at least much better dressed than I was. The bright green-and-red lighting scheme felt more "turnkey tent at Burning Man" than startup, although there was some business to attend to.\u000aDispensaries are too greedy\u000aBefore everyone could get high, we had to listen to six speeches. Steinmetz never really told the crowd how Flow Kana came to be, so allow me. He used to run a food distribution company in Venezuela and came to California to explore the opportunities created by legalization. While working as a consultant at a local dispensary, Steinmetz told me on the phone earlier, he came to realize it was an "unhealthy industry." "Reasonable" margins taken by retail operations are 20 to 30 percent, Steinmetz says, but dispensaries are taking up to 85 percent. He visited Humboldt County, where much of the state\u2019s high-grade marijuana is grown, and found an "almost abandoned town," despite its sizable GDP. After meeting some farmers, he concluded that they were "very much getting the shitty end of the deal."\u000aUnder  California law , only medical marijuana dispensaries, co-ops, or collectives can deliver weed, so he helped create a nonprofit farmers cooperative. "Think of it as a dispensary, except it\u2019s a nonprofit farmers cooperative," he said. Flow Kana takes a 25 percent cut for deliveries, and the farmers can reinvest profits in the cooperative in the form of solar-panel subsidies and such. When I asked how this was legal, Steinmetz uttered my five least favorite words: "We are a technology platform." (It\u2019s the same line used by Uber and Airbnb to evade all manner of regulation.) In other words, it\u2019s a middleman between farmers and their "patients."\u000aAt the party that night, Steinmetz said legalization could mean small-farm subsidies that would "trigger an agricultural revolution." A few minutes later, he described a promotional clip for Flow Kana as "a little manifesto video." "To some, it\u2019s medicine; to some, cognitive ecstasy; to others, it\u2019s a sense of community and a sense of belonging," Steinmetz said. The audience cheered after "ecstasy."\u000aThe audience cheered after "ecstasy"\u000aOne recurring theme during the presentations was how much secrecy has been required of these small operations. Hezekiah Allen, chair and director of an advocacy group called Emerald Growers Association, is also a third-generation cannabis farmer from Southern Humboldt County. Emerald\u2019s 180 members reported annual revenues of $8,000 to $2.2 million. Current estimates, he said, put the tally at 53,000 small farms, many of which are new. "They grew up in prohibition. They don\u2019t look like farms. They\u2019re in warehouses," he said. "When I grew up, we were scattered around in the forest because we were hiding from the Marine Corps and the helicopters giving the children trauma." No one quite knew how to react.\u000aAllen is focused on changing policy. "What I want California to realize is that we have world-class craft cannabis growers in California," he said, and that the value was something to be proud of. My ears perked up. Any time the word "craft" is uttered, money is sure to follow.\u000aFinally we got to meet one of those farmers: Casey O\u2019Neill, an activist and farmer-owner of HappyDay Farms in Mendocino. O\u2019Neill was wearing a white t-shirt with his farm\u2019s name and brown corduroys, and he spoke in a low, syrupy drawl. He said it meant a lot as a farmer to be at this event and "to do honor to the medicine." His farm also grows vegetables, and it boggles O\u2019Neill\u2019s mind that he has to "somehow separate the medicinal value of my broccoli from my cannabis. It\u2019s back to Hippocrates: \u2018Let thy food be thy medicine, medicine thy food.\u2019" Word.\u000aThe house became a fog of smoke\u000aAfter O\u2019Neill came Nicholas Smilgys, a founding member of Sparc, a dispensary in San Francisco, who tried to convey the vast superiority of clean cannabis to its unclean cousins. "On-demand" access from Flow Kana, he said, could also solve San Francisco clustering issues. "No one wants a cannabis dispensary in their backyard. Well now they don\u2019t have to have one. They can just order Flow Kana!"\u000aWith that, the flower girls were off. In a matter of minutes the house become a fog of smoke. An aerialist started winding her way to the ceiling on a long swath of red silk.\u000aThere was no need to hunt for a flower girl; one was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. She also saved me from lighting up the wrong end of my locally sourced Mendocino joint. I passed it along to one of the workers from HappyFarms, who was more than happy to take it.\u000aAccidentally eating a dessert empanada\u000aWhatever I smoked definitely made me feel goooooooood. Very mellow, zero paranoia or sleepiness, just pleasantly elevated and in a generous mood \u2014 happy to be there, inside a redwood umbrella with all these fine people. I wandered outside to check out the view and accidentally ate a dessert empanada that I thought was savory. Reporters from TechCrunch and Mashable were milling by the sweets station.\u000aUpstairs, I ran into my friend  Chris Roberts , who has been covering the cannabis industry for SF Weekly and The San Fransisco Examiner, as well as the publisher\u2019s new site:  SF Evergreen , focused exclusively on marijuana news and culture. I don\u2019t have his discerning palette, but Chris said there was a serious difference between "top-flight" outdoor weed and the stuff grown indoors. The good stuff gives you a "less lethargic, more euphoric feeling," and is better for pain relief and anxiety. "It\u2019s not bullshit!"\u000aHe also said the prices would drop for indoor growers after legalization. The conspiracy theory was that tobacco companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds would buy up all the farms in Humboldt and Mendocino. But that\u2019s crazy talk, he said. No, no, when "Big Marijuana" comes to California, they\u2019re going to set up shop in Central Valley where it\u2019s sunny year-round. ("Big Marijuana" is actually a thing, so go ahead and Google that.)\u000aWe chatted for awhile, occasionally losing our train of thought. The waiters and flower girls passed around more mini beef wellingtons, mini burgers, and laffy taffy, but one puff was enough for me.\u000aMy return trip was a breeze. An SUV showed up in under 10 minutes to go back down the hill and was blissfully voiceover-free. When I transferred between BART lines at MacArthur station, the train I needed was idling across the platform. I found a seat and listened to " Novacane " on loop for most of the way home.\u000a

V5 film techniques J.J. Abrams will use to showcase his Star Wars universe | The Verge
p23
aV5 film techniques J.J. Abrams will use to showcase his Star Wars universe\u000aGet ready for some (subtle) lens flare.\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOne of the great pleasures of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer is seeing a new director inject his own flourishes into an already visually distinctive series. The Star Wars visual catalog has a few staples that have stayed consistent throughout the series: think transitional wipes and pilot POV shots. Unfortunately, the prequels saw George Lucas expand the toolset with a lot of uninspired tricks: slow zooms on wide shots , Barbara Walters glow , and a stubborn use of a locked-down camera.\u000aFrom the looks of the new Star Wars trailer, J.J. Abrams and his cinematographer, Dave Mindel, seem to be trading out the bad visual trademarks and replacing them with some of their own. Here are some examples of what we might be able to expect from Abrams\u2019 visual take on the galaxy.\u000aThe Dolly Shot\u000aIt\u2019s a pretty basic camera move. The gist is that a camera, usually on a track or Steadicam rig, moves forward into the subject, going from a wide shot to a medium shot.  J.J. Abrams does this a lot. Though it is a tried-and-true technique, what makes his dolly moves really dynamic is that while the camera moves forward on the Z-axis, there\u2019s action moving on the X-axis.\u000aSo in this shot, you have the camera moving toward R2-D2 and embers flying from left to right. The combination of Z and X movement can also be seen in the previous Star Wars trailer . It won't add to the Star Wars visual repertoire, but it\u2019s nice to see a killer dolly move in a series that rarely has them.\u000aLens Flares\u000aWait, what? Where?!\u000aIt\u2019s been exhaustively noted that J.J. Abrams loves his lens flares, and he hasn\u2019t taken the criticism lying down. There was significantly less of it in Star Trek Into Darkness, for example.  But if you think The Force Awakens will do away completely with this visual flourish, well you\u2019d be wrong, yet also kind of right.  There are lens flares in there, but they are subtle as all hell. J.J. Abrams actually falls in line with the Star Wars visual design.  Anything more than what we saw in the Darth Maul fight scene would be pushing the boundaries. I think we can all agree with this amount of subtle lens flare; J.J. Abrams can love them all he wants.\u000aShaky Cam Aerial Battles\u000aIt\u2019s a visual holdover from his Star Trek films, and I think it will be a stake in the ground for the rest of the Star Wars saga.  The smooth tracking shots we saw in the aerial battles of the prequels will be replaced with a visceral shaky cam perspective.  Personally, this is my favorite trademark of his, and I\u2019m glad to see it being put to use in Star Wars. The style really makes it feel like you\u2019re in the environment, feeling the turbulence of the action.\u000aCanted Angles\u000aWe got a small taste of the director\u2019s love of canted angles in the above shot. This is another one of Abrams\u2019 visual choices that I love, because he really understands how to properly weigh the shot composition. The canted angle can be pretty hard to pull off correctly since it can quickly fall into hokeyness \u2014 a  bad-looking canted angle has the subject in the center of the frame. But J.J. Abrams is really good at avoiding this pitfall, and creates a beautifully composed shot by populating one side of the frame more heavily than the other.\u000aIn the above shot, for example, you have the floaty TIE fighter lifting up the right side of the frame, while the explosions and the impact of the lasers pushing down the left side.  It looks great, and the canted angle remains natural.\u000aSnap Zoom\u000aThis snap zoom shot caused a lot of discussion among the Verge Staff .  J.J. Abrams used the technique to great effect in the Star Trek films , and he\u2019s using it again in Star Wars.  It\u2019s a precarious technique inspired by camcorder war footage. Surprisingly though, this technique actually fits within the Star Wars catalog of camera moves.  You\u2019ll see it used a couple of times in the Battle of Geonosis in Episode II . I\u2019m ambivalent on the technique being used here. It can bring a sense of realism, but also make you feel like you\u2019re in on the artifice of it all.\u000aI think this is all great and has got me more excited about Star Wars than ever before. Based on the trailer it looks like J.J. Abrams and company are doing away with the series' stale camera work. In the end I hope this opens the gates for the Star Wars directors to have more authorship over the saga, avoiding the sameness that plagues the Marvel films.\u000a

VACLU says the government shouldn't have the power to cancel the Redskins trademark | The Verge
p26
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Washington Redskins are back in the spotlight again. This past June, the US Patent and Trademark office  canceled six trademarks belonging to the NFL team, claiming the name and mascot were "disparaging to Native Americans." Now, the ACLU has appealed the decision on the grounds that the cancellation violates the First Amendment.\u000aIn a blog post published today on the ACLU's website titled  You're Not Wrong, You're Just An A**hole , ACLU staff attorney Esha Bhandari argues that although the Redskins' name is offensive, the government doesn't have the authority to make the team change it. Bhandari argues that "arbitrary decisions" like this make it possible for the government to police anything it finds to be "scandalous."\u000aBhandari also notes that under the  Lanham Act \u2014 a trademark law the ACLU calls "problematic" \u2014 the government technically does have the power to make decisions regarding which trademarks deserve protection. In ACLU's amicus brief , the organization argues that finding a specific section of the Lanham Act unconstitutional would not "significantly alter the landscape of trademark law." Below is an excerpt from the amicus brief, filed yesterday:\u000aIt is indisputable that registration of a mark provides substantial benefits to a trademark holder; it is also true that many trademarks involve expressive speech and association. Therefore, by authorizing the government to deny registration of certain marks because of a viewpoint-based determination about the character of expressive speech, Section 2(a) [which prohibits the trademark] violates the First Amendment.\u000a

V15 things we learned from The New Yorker's Jony Ive profile | The Verge
p29
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIt's not very often that Apple welcomes reporters through its doors, let alone allows them to spend a significant amount of time with some of its chief employees. But last year, The New Yorker had a chance to visit and speak with Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, and the magazine has just published a long profile of him. You can read the entire piece  over at The New Yorker's website , but we've pulled out a few of the more interesting bits of information that we learned about Jony Ive, the Apple Watch, and more while reading through it:\u000aIve has a Banksy poster in his office\u000aDecorations in Ive's office include: a Playmobil likeness of himself, a rugby ball, a  design poster that ends with the phrase "think about all the fucking possibilities," and  a Banksy print of the Queen overlaid with the face of a chimp.\u000aIve helped J.J. Abrams design Star Wars' new lightsaber\u000aThough Abrams and his team created the initial design of the new lightsaber on their own,  Ive gave Abrams some "very specific" suggestions after seeing it \u2014 and those suggestions will apparently factor into the final cut of the movie. Ive appears to have pushed for the weapon to be a bit more analog and primitive, "less precise and just a little bit more spitty," Abrams says. Ive apparently had no comment on the controversial cross guard.\u000aIve is into cars (and hates Toyotas)\u000aThis should fuel plenty of speculation now that Apple is  reported to be working on a car . The New Yorker's profile says that both Ive and his design pal / new coworker Marc Newson are really into cars, but they're apparently  pretty disappointed with what's currently on the road.\u000a"There are some shocking cars on the road," Ive said. "One person\u2019s car is another person\u2019s scenery." To his right was a silver sedan with a jutting lower lip. Ive said, quietly, "For example." As the disgraced car fell behind, I asked Ive to critique its design: "It is baffling, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just nothing, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just insipid." He declined to name the model, muttering, "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to offend." (Toyota Echo.)\u000aThat's not even the only dig at Toyota in the piece. It also mentions:\u000aJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of operations, drives an old Toyota Camry. Ive\u2019s verdict, according to Williams, is "Oh, God."\u000aIve owns an Aston Martin DB4, but he's currently riding around in a Bentley Mulsanne. Ive says that he loves Bentleys entirely because of their design. He also says that he's always been kind of torn about Bentleys' "other connotations" (presumably: implying that their owners are crazy rich).\u000aIve doesn't like Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography\u000aIve tells The New Yorker that he's only seen parts of the biography, but that it's enough for him to dislike it on the basis of inaccuracies. "My regard couldn\u2019t be any lower," he said.\u000aIve (seemingly) isn't thrilled about the iPhone 6's camera bump\u000aThe iPhone 6's protruding camera lens is kind of annoying \u2014 and a little bit ugly \u2014 making it a surprising sight on a product out of Ive's lab. It's perhaps no surprise that Ive doesn't seem totally happy about its presence. He tells The New Yorker that it is "a really very pragmatic optimization." He continues: "And, yeah..."\u000aApple considered making a larger iPhone 4\u000aIt took Apple a long time \u2014 arguably, a bit too long \u2014 to get on board with the large cellphone trend. But according to Ive, Apple was thinking about it far earlier than the company actually began to make one. His studio had apparently designed a larger smartphone based on the iPhone 4, but the results were "clunky" and "uncompelling," so Apple never made it.\u000aIve doesn't care for Google Glass (and neither does Tim Cook)\u000aThis probably isn't a surprise, but Ive thinks that a smartwatch is a better solution for notifications than a display in your glasses.\u000aWhen he later saw Google Glass, Ive said, it was evident to him that the face "was the wrong place." Cook said, "We always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we\u2019ve always believed." He went on, "We always thought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has." He looked at the Apple Watch on his wrist. "This isn\u2019t obnoxious. This isn\u2019t building a barrier between you and me."\u000aIve probably isn't a fan of Moto Maker\u000aIve asked The New Yorker not to name what product he's talking about here, but we can make a good guess:\u000aIn one of our conversations, Ive was scathing about a rival\u2019s product, after asking me not to name it: "Their value proposition was \u2018Make it whatever you want. You can choose whatever color you want.\u2019 And I believe that\u2019s abdicating your responsibility as a designer."\u000aTim Cook may not love Beats' hardware design\u000aCook loves to talk about Beats Music and its playlists. We haven't heard him talk about Beats headphones very much. This might be the reason why:\u000aWhen I spoke to Cook, he lauded Beats\u2019 music-streaming service and its personnel before praising its hardware. "Would Jony have designed some of the products?" he said. "Obviously, you can look at them and say no." He went on, "But you\u2019re not buying it for what it is\u2014you\u2019re buying it for what it can be."\u000aThe Apple Watch still needs some work\u000aTo conserve battery life, the Apple Watch's screen stays off until its wearer lifts their wrist up to look at it \u2014 but apparently Apple was far from perfecting this feature as of the watch's unveiling.\u000aIn the prototypes worn around the Cupertino campus at the end of last year, this feature was still glitchy. For Marc Newson, it took three attempts\u2014an escalation of acting styles, from naturalism to melodrama\u2014before his screen came to life.\u000aThe Apple Watch may eventually come in more materials\u000aIve tells The New Yorker that he believes people are "okay or okay to a degree" with carrying around the same phone as everyone else, but that people will not accept this with a product that they're going to wear around. That's why his lab decided to use different materials for different models of the Apple Watch, including aluminum, stainless steel, and gold. Notably, while discussing the materials that they've explored using, Ive adds, "We\u2019ve not stopped."\u000aAn Ultrasuede cloth may come with some models of the Apple Watch\u000aOne designer in Ive's lab proposed including an "orangey-brown" color of the cloth with models of the gold Apple Watch. Ive dismissed the color choice as something you'd find in a cheap student apartment. The idea of including a cloth, however, appears to remain on the table.\u000aThe Apple Watch was always going to be rectangular\u000aWatch enthusiasts may have been hoping for a classically styled circular watch, but Apple ended up unveiling a sightly rectangular one on stage last year. Apparently, that wasn't purely for technological reasons \u2014 Ive actually thinks that a circular face doesn't make sense for what you'll be doing on it. That's because a "huge part of the function is lists," he says, so "a circle doesn\u2019t make any sense."\u000aThe Apple Watch prompted a store redesign\u000aAngela Ahrendts, Apple's senior VP of retail and the former CEO of Burberry, is working on a redesign of Apple's retail stores ahead of the smartwatch launch. It's not stated how significant or slight these changes may be, but Apple clearly believes that a different experience is needed to sell a premium watch. As The New Yorker puts it, "These new spaces will surely become a more natural setting for vitrines filled with gold (and perhaps less welcoming, at least in some corners, to tourists and truants)."\u000aThe Apple Watch is more Ive's than any previous Apple product\u000aThat's according to Jeff Williams (who drives the Camry). Ive reportedly encountered resistance at Apple while pitching the Watch project: some at the company were concerned about how a watch would be displayed in stores; they were also worried that it might create a divide between more and less wealthy customers. Ive finally convinced Apple and formally began working on the smartwatch in fall of 2011, around the time the iPhone 4S was released.\u000a

VA close look at the Gear VR for the Galaxy S6 | The Verge

aVA close look at the Gear VR for the Galaxy S6\u000aVirtual reality is now an accessory, not a niche technology\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aEarlier this week, we saw some big news in the world of virtual reality when HTC announced the Vive, a new VR headset made in partnership with legacy video game company Valve. But the most important news for the adoption of virtual reality came from Samsung, Oculus, and Facebook: there's a new version of the Gear VR that can be powered by both the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the S6 Edge.\u000aVirtual reality is quite obviously still in a nascent state. Even the best headsets still face myriad problems like poor resolution, bulky headsets, and social stigma. "What we want to do is we want to get down to sunglasses," says Max Cohen, head of Oculus Mobile.\u000a"What we want to do is we want to get down to sunglasses."\u000aBut that\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon. Cohen couldn\u2019t comment on a time frame, but admits how far Oculus has to go before VR glasses are a reality. "Every aspect of this technology, both on Gear VR and the Rift, still needs to improve to get it where we want it," he says. "We're not going to declare victory any time soon." Until then, headsets that use phone drop-ins might be the best consumer solution available.\u000aThe original Gear VR, which works with the Galaxy Note 4, took a step towards solving some of VR\u2019s problems, but left much to be desired. The resolution was good enough, but not great. It was wireless and light, but got uncomfortable after extended use. And it did little to change the fact that people inevitably view you differently once you have a VR headset on your face, and you\u2019re unavoidably cut off from the world. Perhaps most important, not many people owned the Galaxy Note 4, whereas the new version will work on a mainstream phone.\u000aThe first two issues are alleviated in the newest version of the Gear VR. At first blush, the new version is not much different than the Gear VR that uses the Galaxy Note 4. But once you put it on the differences are profound. To start with, the whole unit is much lighter, thanks in part to the fact that the Galaxy S6 weighs less than the Note 4. The straps are more comfortable but still fit tightly, and there's a vent on the left side of the headset that helps reduce lens fogging. Overall, Samsung has really gotten the headset to feel, well, less like a headset.\u000aThe new Gear VR feels less like a headset\u000aThe other big focus for Samsung and Oculus is increasing the screen resolution, which is another place Cohen is ready to admit that the company \u2014 and virtual reality as a medium \u2014 still has a long way to go.\u000a"The reality is we need to go a lot further. We need 4K screens, potentially even 8K screens. So there's still some time before we feel like we've hit the point where that "screen door effect," as we call the impression of a pixelated display, goes away entirely. But the 1440p looks pretty darn good."\u000aHe\u2019s right. The Galaxy S6\u2019s 5.1-inch screen is smaller than the 5.7-inch one found on the Note 4, but that means the pixel density is noticeably higher \u2014 577 ppi compared to 515. That might not sound like a lot, but it made a big difference when I got to try it here at MWC. Everything I queued up \u2014 games, a new Cirque du Soleil demo, a 360-degree 3D photos app made by Otoy \u2014 was more impressive than anything found on the Note 4 version of the Gear VR.\u000aBut the difference from the old version to the new was most stark in the videos featured in the Oculus Cinema section. On the Note 4 version of the Gear VR, this was by far my least favorite content \u2014 it's where the weaknesses of the resolution and lower pixel density were most apparent. My eyes would strain after just 10 or 15 seconds of watching a video, and the experience was worse with 3D content. But on the Galaxy S6 version, all the videos I previewed were not only watchable, they were enjoyable. That screen door effect was majorly mitigated here, and in its place was a much smoother and visually comfortable experience.\u000aIt's hard to understate how important this could be for the success of the Gear VR, and Oculus' efforts in the mobile space in general. The biggest barrier to the Gear VR so far hasn't been the social awkwardness of wearing a head-mounted display, it's that it only worked with a niche device. The idea of a $199 consumer VR device was attractive to many, but shelling out nearly $1,000 more to get a Note 4 off-contract kept the reality of it out of reach.\u000aThe new headset will likely be priced the same, though Samsung will ultimately set the price when it releases it to market \u2014 it\u2019s not yet clear when that will happen. Cohen told us before that he thinks the ideal price is free. Alongside the new headset the company also announced that paid content is making its way to the Gear VR (it should be available in the Oculus store now, and to Note 4 users as well).\u000aImagine the hype if it were compatible with an iPhone\u000aThe Gear VR is about to face its sink-or-swim moment. Instead of being a cool idea burdened by the requirement of owning a niche device, it's now going to be an affordable accessory to a phone that millions of people will own. If you still don't think that's a big deal, you probably haven\u2019t tried it. And imagine the hype if it were compatible with an iPhone.\u000aBy leveraging the new revenue source with paid content and spreading the user base by building a headset around a flagship phone, the idea of dropping the price of the Gear VR to zero doesn\u2019t seem so crazy anymore.\u000aUntil then, people are going to have to understand a few simple facts: virtual reality still needs headsets, and headsets are inherently awkward. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the experience isn\u2019t outrageously cool.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VAcer's new Aspire V 17 Nitro puts a Kinect-like camera inside a gaming laptop | The Verge
p44
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aGaming PCs have always been about power: their job is to do more things, more quickly. But as Intel's RealSense 3D camera, Leap Motion, and other technologies start to be integrated into laptops, gamers are starting to get not just new games to play but new ways to play them.\u000aTake Acer's Aspire V 17 Nitro, the company's well-received entry-level gaming laptop. Acer announced a new model today ahead of CES that includes RealSense, which uses a standard camera, an infrared sensor, and a laser projector to map the world in three dimensions. It's similar to Kinect in a lot of ways, and can see an amazing amount \u2014 all ten of your fingers, what's behind you, even your exact facial expressions. Acer's bundling a few apps that take advantage of the tech as a way of proving its usefulness: there's Warrior Wave, a game in which you use your hands to manipulate every aspect of your players, and a 3D-scanning app called 3DMe. They're niche uses with niche compatibility right now, but they open up a huge number of ways you might start to interact with your computer. As other manufacturers start to support RealSense, too, it's going to become a more versatile platform very quickly. (RealSense already helps power the HP Sprout , which has its own weird ideas about interaction.)\u000aOtherwise, the V Nitro is just a good-looking gaming machine. It has a 17.3-inch, 1080p display, Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M graphics, up to 16GB of RAM, and as much as 1TB of hard drive space. There are even four speakers and a Blu-ray drive \u2014 this is a media machine through and through. It's a fairly simple-looking device, really, its glowing red keyboard the only indication it's a gaming laptop.\u000aThe new V Nitro will be on sale in January. Price wasn't announced, but it'll probably sit once again near the low end of the gaming-laptop spectrum. And if you buy one, it will be watching you. And your fingers.\u000a
