aVTech\u000a23andMe gets thumbs up from big pharma with $50 million Genentech deal\u000aThe FDA might have banned its medical reports in the US, but 23andMe still has a stockpile of genetic data to sell\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aDespite setbacks from regulators, 23andMe is attracting serious interest from heavy-hitters in the pharmaceutical industry. The ambitious genetics startup has received  a first payment of $10 million from biotech company Genentech in exchange for genetic data donated by customers of 23andMe\u2019s personal genome service.  Forbes reports that the Silicon Valley company \u2014 which is partly backed by Google Ventures \u2014 can look forward to additional payments of "as much as $50 million," with Genentech reportedly planning to dig out anonymous individuals from the company's database for further study.\u000a23andMe's medical reports have been banned \u2014 but it still has the genetic data that they collected\u000aFor 23andMe, the investment is a lifeline. In late 2013, the company was  banned from selling the health reports produced using its saliva test kits after they were judged to be in violation of the FDA\u2019s marketing guidelines. Although the company was allowed to continue selling  ancestry reports and uninterpreted genetic information , some members of the medical community seized upon the ban as proof that 23andMe\u2019s mission to make genetic testing available outside the doctor\u2019s office was misguided. However, by this point the company had attracted some 800,000 customers, three-quarters of whom consented to have their data used anonymously for medical research. It\u2019s this information that is now being sold on for use in for-profit medical research to keep 23andMe afloat.\u000aThis may surprise some of the startup's customers, but by all accounts, selling anonymous medical data was always part of the company's business plan. It was certainly never going to make enough money to survive from its home tests alone. ( In 2012 it slashed the prices for its kits from $299 to $99 while rival firm deCODEme sold a similar service for $1,100.) However, interest in this data from Genentech shows that the multi-trillion dollar big pharma industry is finally taking 23andMe seriously. Genentech isn't just a biotech company \u2014 it's also the US arm of Swiss giant Roche, the world's fifth-largest pharmaceutical company which boasts annual revenue of some  $50 billion . It's not the first such deal either \u2014 23andMe has previously  partnered with Pfizer to further research into inflammatory bowel disease.\u000awithout FDA approval to sell home dna tests, 23ANDMe can only survive for so long\u000aThe problem now for 23andMe is that its current database of genetic information will only be useful for so long. Speaking to Forbes, chief executive Anne Wojcicki says that the company is "in it for the long haul," but it will need to work hard to get the FDA on side and return to offering the public DNA tests. However, it's already  expanding to the UK , and if big pharmaceutical companies continue to validate its work and methods, then government approval will likely follow.\u000a

VA new documentary asks: Will e-sports ever go mainstream? | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000a"Why do you like watching someone else play a video game?"\u000aMy fiancée, among other people, has asked me this multiple times throughout our relationship. She doesn't get it. Most people don't get it. But it's simple, really: skill.\u000aI pride myself in my own video game skills \u2014 my first-person shooter skills, specifically. I'm better than my friends and my co-workers. I do well online, but I'm not the best, and that aggravates me. There was a time though when I wanted to be the best.\u000aThen I found e-sports.\u000aProfessional gamers are superhuman, just like LeBron James and Sidney Crosby are superhuman \u2014 consistently capable of performing feats that seem impossible. There's one main difference with e-sports, though: most viewers understand what's happening in basketball and hockey. Even just visually, video games can be dauntingly complicated.\u000aProfessional gamers are superhuman\u000aA work-in-progress cut of  All Work All Play , a documentary that focuses on the rise of e-sports and some of the best competitive teams in the world, just premiered at the TriBeCa Film Festival. All Work All Play profiles a few professional League of Legends teams as well as the programming director of the Electronic Sports League, Michal "Carmac" Blicharz. The film attempts to bring the viewer into the world of competitive gaming while constantly making comparisons to other professional sports by highlighting team changes, grandiose spectacles, intense crowds, and broadcasters.\u000aThe story of Carmac and his rise in the e-sports community is fascinating: learning about his rise from small LAN gatherings, where he and his friends would hustle other competitors to make a living; to seeing him with his adorable family as he plans for the future of spectator gaming, which was by far my favorite storyline in the film. Carmac's story is interwoven with the journey of select teams competing at ESL's largest and most prestigious tournament, Intel Extreme Masters.\u000aAll Work All Play tried harder, and succeeded better, than any other attempt I've seen to make e-sports relatable and coherent \u2014 but it's still extremely confusing. I've played League of Legends (albeit very briefly) and have a general understanding of how the game works. I'll watch tournaments if they're on when I'm browsing Twitch because I like the intensity and the stakes. It's a rush even if the skill isn't super apparent to me because I know these players are the best in the world. Early on, an attempt is made to explain what League of Legends is and what competitors need to do in order to win. I followed along, but it went by so quickly that I can't imagine someone without any prior knowledge fully grasping the game's mechanics, and it reminded me why e-sports will always be a niche spectacle.\u000aThe basics of League of Legends are simple enough, but the difference between an average player and a world-class one is in the details: attacks, defense, abilities, upgrades, gold, strategy, teamwork, and so on. Mastering all of these mechanics and then executing them is what separates high-level players from everyone else. They're consistently able to recognize what tactics and abilities to use in any given situation at any given time. The time and dedication necessary to achieve that mastery is almost unfathomable, and even then, some top-level players are still better than others. But unless you've studied the game, you won't know why they're better, like you would when seeing LeBron dunk over three people. It's right here that e-sports become inaccessible to the masses, and All Work All Play doesn't change that.\u000aThe being said, the film tries, and in some instances succeeds, to establish familiarity. The intensity of the matches will seem familiar to anyone who has watched any other professional sport, thanks to some really solid editing work. A typical League of Legends game can last over 30 minutes, but best-of-five game series were run through in a few minutes, which made these sequences extremely watchable.\u000aIn order to truly understand e-sports, you need to understand the people, not the games\u000aBut in order to truly appreciate e-sports, you need to understand the people playing, not the games they're playing, which is All Work All Play's greatest shortcoming. It focuses on entire teams, but not the individuals within them, and that's an important difference. I gained new respect for game developers after watching Indie Game: The Movie because the filmmakers showed me lives instead of products. People are relatable. Niche games are not, unless you're already in that niche.\u000aWhile e-sports will continue to rise in popularity, it will always be growing a niche segment \u2014 the mass-market appeal still isn't there. Plus, in order to survive, e-sports has to adapt as the games and communities evolve over time. Basketball hasn't changed much in the last hundred years, but competitive video games change all the time. There was Quake and Starcraft, Halo and Call of Duty; and now, LoL and Starcraft 2. Attention spans fade, people lose interest, and you're only left with memories of a game you used to like that no one plays anymore. I'll always watch because I appreciate the talent, but I expect most people don't recognize it and haven't had a compelling reason to care. Documentaries like All Work All Play, no matter how interesting or well edited, won't change that any time soon.\u000aVerge Video archive: Dota 2's $10 million tournament takes over an arena (2014)\u000a

VAlcatel looks to undercut everyone with cheap new smartwatch | The Verge
p8
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAlcatel has announced its first ever smartwatch, a device that it claims will create "a new market segment: the affordable smart watch." The budget phone maker says that its imaginatively named Watch will be available "at a fraction of the cost of competitors" \u2014 although the company has yet to specify any prices or, indeed, any hardware specs.\u000aWatch will offer standard features: notifications, activity tracker, music controls\u000aWith its conventional round face, the Watch looks similar to the  Moto 360 and Alcatel claims it has the "same look and feel as a traditional watch." But while Alcatel has avoided the 360's problem of a display with a small divot cut out of the bottom, the Watch's screen doesn't appear to fill the entire watch face. Instead, there seems to be a fully functional inner display surrounded by a semi-active ring.\u000aAlcatel says the Watch connects to Android smartphones, monitors daily activity (the render above shows a heart rate monitor in action), controls music, takes photos (presumably acting as a remote shutter button for your cameraphone), and receives notifications. The company also says it will offer "choices and styles" for the Watch, with the promotional render showing what looks to be a plastic sports strap and a more formal metal version. Until we know more, it's not quite clear how the Alcatel Watch will match up to  the best smartwatches available , but we'll be keeping our eyes open at CES 2015 for any new details.\u000a

V23andMe to offer users' medical data to Pfizer for research | The Verge
p14
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aFollowing hard on the heels of its  $60 million deal with Genentech , personal genetics startup 23andMe has announced an agreement to  share its user data and research platform with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. Although 23andMe is still languishing under  FDA restrictions (the company is only permitted to offer ancestry reports and raw genetic data to customers \u2014 not medical analysis), its well-organized database of some 640,000 genotyped individuals is proving popular with the medical industry.\u000a"The largest data set of its kind."\u000aIn a  press statement announcing the deal, 23andMe spelled out the attractions of its genetic resources: "Researchers can now fully benefit from the largest dataset of its kind, running queries in minutes across more than 1,000 different diseases, conditions, and traits. With this information researchers can identify new associations between genes and diseases and traits more quickly than ever before." The two companies will also collaborate on "genome-wide association studies, surveys, and clinical trial recruitment" starting with a 5,000-person study into lupus.\u000aThe genetic information in 23andMe's database is anonymized and voluntary. Customers who bought 23andMe's $99 saliva test kits are given the option to share their data for this sort of research \u2014 although it's likely that some individuals will still be uneasy that their genetic information is going to multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, for 23andMe, this data is a crucial product, not just in terms of revenue (the value of this latest deal with Pfizer has not been disclosed) but in bolstering its reputation as a serious player in the world of medical research.\u000a

V2014 had the fewest flight crashes in decades | The Verge
p17
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aGiven the number of major flight crashes and disappearances this year, it might seem like flight safety has taken a bad turn. But it turns out that 2014 hasn't actually been a statistically worse year than many of those in the recent past. As pointed out  by The Wall Street Journal , the Aviation Safety Network currently measures both the accident and fatality rate of 2014 flights as falling beneath the 10-year average \u2014 making this year an improvement in some areas.\u000aThere have been fewer accidents but more deaths\u000aNotably, those figures don't include Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, because it was shot down, or the disappearance of a 162-person AirAsia flight this weekend, which is still being investigated. They also disregard planes that can carry fewer than 14 people. But even so, the network measures only 19 accidents for 2014, which is far below the 10-year annual average of 32 accidents. The accident count is actually even lower than it was last year (29), continuing the trend of accident rates dropping to the lowest levels they've been at in decades.\u000aDespite accident rates dropping, deaths from these accidents are rising this year. In 2013, there were 265 deaths from flight accidents \u2014 this year they are currently measured to at 526, and that may rise above the 10-year average of 676 deaths. However, the Journal notes that it's far lower than the 1,074 deaths seen in 2005. That means that even in spite of the high-profile issues this year, flight safety is still showing improvements in some areas.\u000a

aVA technology-free music festival is a terrible idea\u000aWhat is 'traditional electricity' anyway?\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aInnocent Un-plugged , a music festival "for grown-ups" run by British smoothie makers Innocent (now owned by Coca-Cola), is attempting to differentiate itself from hundreds of other festivals with one key conceit \u2014 it's offering a "weekend off the grid" with "no Wi-Fi, no 3G," and  "no traditional electricity."\u000aSo, exactly the same as every other British music festival, then. They all become impromptu Wi-Fi-free zones anyway because:\u000aThey take place in fields, and fields, by design, are usually far from networking equipment,\u000aThe charging tent is packed with men in tweed flat caps called Jeremy, women with devastatingly pungent dreadlocks, people daubed in a chunky mixture of neon body paint and vomit, and that one guy with a pink mohawk and a neck tattoo swaying angrily at anyone who looks his way. They are not places you want to spend much time.\u000aUn-plugged is trying to offer something different to larger music festivals \u2014 there's food served on a plate in some of the pictures, rather than on a stick \u2014 but it's not clear exactly what that is. What is "traditional electricity," and what will Un-plugged attendees get instead? Hand-crafted artisanal electricity harvested directly from beard static? Generators powered by clapping and ukeleles?\u000aWill enforcers smash smartphones if they find people online?\u000aLogistically, of course, it's impossible. To totally distance a festival from the internet you'd have to have it in a place like the Scottish Highlands, or Svalbard, or on the Moon. Un-plugged takes place in Kent, the next county over from London. Short of dropping a vast lead dome over a significant portion of the British countryside, there's no way to stop trickles of 3G signal from infiltrating the venue. If the festival is serious about its mission, it'll be forced to employ roving gangs of Innocent enforcers to find and smash smartphones, relying on networks of snitches and informants to reveal when their loved ones have snuck off to check Instagram in exchange for another smoothie.\u000aWhy are brands trying to get us to disconnect from the grid, anyway? Are they going to wait until we've all gone to the forest, then repossess our houses, turning them into  Bates murder motels ? Or are they just trying to make us feel bad? There's a weirdly paternalistic tone to this kind of advertising, as if spending time on the internet is sinful compared to the pleasures of sleeping in a yurt when you've got a perfectly good bed at home and weathering the UK's many delightful summer rainstorms.\u000aThe internet is better than Mr. Motivator\u000aIs seeing  Mr. Motivator , famous for wearing lycra on morning TV during the 1990's, really a better use of your time than browsing through the entire sum of human knowledge on a functionally magic device that fits in your pocket? After three days of camping top-to-tail, when you're sick of the sight of each other, is talking to your friends and family without distraction that tempting a prospect? Is obeying a Coca-Cola-mandated order to lock yourself away from the joy and pain of our entire planet that laudable a goal?\u000aI've been off the grid at too many festivals, thanks. Plug me back in.\u000a

aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aToday, Android is the world's most pervasive mobile operating system on the planet, powering millions of smartphones, tablets, wearables, and more. But that wasn't always the case, and Android's public life started from humble beginnings just about six years ago.\u000aThe Android of 2008 \u2014 what debuted on the first Android smartphone, T-Mobile's G1 aka the HTC Dream \u2014 looks almost nothing like the Android we use today. It was slow, clumsy, not particularly intuitive, and frankly, just plain ugly. But Google being Google, the company quickly iterated on Android and issued many numerous updates to add functionality, improve usability, and clean up the appearance of Android over the years.\u000aRemember the Motorola Xoom?\u000aNotable releases include 2008's Android 1.5 Cupcake, which was the first version seen by the public; 2009's Android 2.0 Eclair, which ushered in the Motorola Droid and free turn-by-turn smartphone navigation; 2011's Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the first Android release to really embrace tablets; late 2011's Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, which debuted a more modern style and interface; 2013's Android 4.4 KitKat, which arrived via a sponsored partnership with Nestle; and 2014's Android 5.0 Lollipop, the cleanest, nicest to use version of Android yet.\u000aAndroid has gone through many shapes, sizes, and designs over the years, and today's Android is designed to run on not just phones and tablets, but wearables, cars, appliances, and countless other devices. Where will Android go tomorrow? And more importantly, what will the next dessert theme be? Only the future (and maybe a few brains at Google) knows that, but we're eager to go along for the ride.\u000a

aVA paid version of Tinder is reportedly launching today\u000aTinder Plus adds undo button and passport feature, for a price\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aTinder will introduce a paid version of its popular dating app on Monday,  TechCrunch reports . The paid version,  known as Tinder Plus , adds two main features: a "rewind" option that lets users reconsider the last person they rejected ("left-swiped"), and a passport function that lets them swipe in different cities. Citing sources familiar with the situation, TechCrunch reports that the paid version will be available for under $10 in the US, though prices will reportedly vary across different markets.\u000aPaying for the service will also remove ads, which are reportedly launching on Tinder's network later this month. Last week,  Recode reported that the Los Angeles-based startup is building an ad product that will be led by Brian Norgard, who co-founded the Tappy ephemeral messaging app that Tinder  acquired earlier this year .\u000aTinder has been testing an "unlimited like" feature in Tinder Plus in recent weeks. It's terrible.\u000aThe company has been testing Tinder Plus across Europe over the past few weeks, with prices ranging from $0.99 to $19.99 per month. I was forced to update to the freemium version of the app last week, which limits my likes unless I pay $9.99 per month. Last month, the company said it was  beta testing the 24-hour right-swipe limit as a way to crack down on porn-y spambots, but as  Business Insider notes , the feature has resulted in some rather negative feedback in App Store reviews.\u000aIt's not yet clear whether limited likes will be included in the version of Tinder Plus that launches today. (TechCrunch makes no mention of it in its report.) A Tinder spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u000a

aVA flying camera that follows you anywhere is the next evolution of the consumer drone\u000aQuadcopters like Airdog are going fully autonomous, and perfecting the industry's next killer feature\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aBack in June we reported on the Airdog , a Kickstarter project we thought might become the ultimate GoPro sidekick. $1.3 million in funding later , the Airdog is about to start shipping out to backers and getting ready to go on sale later this year. Today at CES we got to check out this drone in person and watch as it followed pro skater Madars Apse through some trick runs on the halfpipe. As drones become an increasingly mainstream consumer product, the next big leap will come from advancements in technology that allows the drones to autonomously fly, follow you, and avoid collisions. Airdog looks like a company with a lot of momentum on all three of those fronts.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aAirdog is the product of Helico Aerospace Industries, a Latvian company founded by CEO Edgars Rozentals, who has been an internet entrepreneur for more than a decade. He's been an action sports buff for a while, then got into flying model helicopters, followed by drones. Airdog was born of these passions and built with the wealth of computer science and engineering talent that is available in Latvia.\u000aWith a top speed of 45 miles per hour and can stay aloft for 10-20 minutes depending on your speed and track your movements from up to 1000 feet away. The unit is currently available for pre-order at $1,295 and has a suggested retail price of $1,495. Since it's meant for use outdoors and during rugged action sports, it's water-resistant and features fold up props so that the entire thing can easily fit into your average backpack.\u000aRozentals and his team began by simply connecting the drone to a smartphone in the user's pocket, relying on GPS for position tracking. But that wasn't very precise. "What we needed to do was both track your position and project where you would be next based on your motion," explains Rozentals.\u000aSo the team added in the Airleash wristband, which is packed with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and other sensors that allow it to predict your movement and fly accordingly. Both the position and orientation of the drone, as well as the angle of the camera, are controlled by algorithms that communicate between the leash and the drone. The leash also has some manual controls that allow you to make adjustments to the Airdog while you're riding without having to whip out your smartphone.\u000aAirdog is working on the holy grail of drones: sense and avoid\u000aNext up after following its target is having the Airdog sense and avoid obstacles. The company currently uses maps within its app, so that users can set areas as designated fly or no-fly zones, mark out obstacles like trees and buildings, and chart a race course they want the Airdog to follow them through. Next up is sensors on the drone that would allow it to actually see and avoid obstacles in real time, the holy grail of the drone industry that so far, nobody has been able to really implement.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a
