V12-inch MacBook review | The Verge
p2
aV(Shot on location at WeWork . Also available on YouTube )\u000aApple's latest laptop is simply called the MacBook.\u000aActually, I suppose, you're going to see everybody refer to it as "the new MacBook" for a little while, but that's just temporary. The name is a signal. Apple could have called it the MacBook Air 12-inch or the MacBook Slim or any number of other things. But instead, it\u2019s the MacBook. That has to mean something.\u000aYou are really, really going to want this laptop, even though it's relatively expensive, starting at $1,299. It\u2019s easily the most impressive laptop I\u2019ve seen since the original MacBook Air. It\u2019s almost unbelievable in every regard. How did Apple make it so thin? What dark magicks make this trackpad work? Is it really going to be fast enough? Why is there only one port? Every one of those questions has an interesting answer, and the mere fact that a laptop can still engender this much intrigue in 2015 is remarkable.\u000aAfter using this tiny little wonder of a computer for a little over a week, I have a pretty strong guess about what the name means. It\u2019s called the MacBook because Apple sees it as the Platonic ideal of what a laptop should be. It\u2019s what Apple believes all laptops should eventually become.\u000aBut if you know anything about Platonic ideals, you know that there's a big difference between the ideal and the reality. And so the big question for this tiny new MacBook is simple: is the reality anywhere close to the ideal?\u000aThe MacBook is what happens when the iPad Air decides to up and grow a keyboard, hinge, and trackpad. It's a thin, compact, and light sliver of a machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines. The same precision we've seen on Apple's phones and tablets has been applied here \u2014 it's genuinely a level above any other laptop Apple has ever made, to say nothing of other hardware makers.\u000aIt is, in a word, beautiful.\u000aA thin machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines\u000aIt's almost impossibly thin, measuring just over 13mm at its thickest point. It's even more impossibly light, weighing just over two pounds. That's about a full pound less than the 13-inch MacBook Air and a third of a pound less than the 11-inch Air. And that weight is perfectly distributed across the deck of the laptop and the screen. It's so well-balanced that it feels lighter than it actually is.\u000aPeople who use the 11-inch Air are going to feel right at home, and actually people who use the 13-inch Air will, too. It just feels like the ideal size for a small laptop, perfectly fitted to a full-sized keyboard and not a whit bigger. Apple also redesigned the hinge so that it is made of metal, increased the size of the trackpad, and moved the speakers (which are reasonably loud, but obviously lack anything resembling bass) up above the keyboard.\u000aIn comes in gold, silver, and space gray. I got a gold review unit because, well, why not? I think it totally works. It's much more restrained in person than you might think, but honestly I'd probably end up choosing the space gray model.\u000aTo pull off this design, Apple's marketing video will tell you that it required a lot of inventions. The keyboard, trackpad, screen, and batteries all needed to be redone to make the MacBook as thin as it is. And in every one of those cases, you can safely believe the hype. But the flip side of invention is compromise, and unfortunately there's enough of that here that I have to leaven the enthusiasm I've been expressing thus far with a warning: it's not all wonderful. Invention and compromise.\u000aBut let's stick with the inventions for now, because they truly are remarkable. It starts with the keyboard, which is shallower than what you might be used to. Underneath each key is a butterfly mechanism, a "steel dome" that registers your keystrokes, and an individual backlight for every single key.\u000aAt first, I hated it. It felt weird to have each button move so little when I pressed down on it. But it didn't take long at all for me to change my mind. The combination of all those new parts meant that the essential friction and "clack" that make up any great keyboard is still here, just different than what I was used to. I can bang away on this thing or type more softly, and both feel completely satisfying. The only real hassles are the redesigned up and down arrow keys: they're entirely too small.\u000aThe next thing is the screen, a 236 ppi Retina display that's 2304 x 1440 pixels. The invention here is that it's thinner and brighter thanks to rearranged electronics inside, and it's also more energy efficient. The thinner screen also means that the Apple logo on the back of the laptop no longer lights up, if that's something you care about. But ignore those specs and just look at it: it simply puts the screen on the MacBook Air to shame.\u000aThe redesigned keyboard will grow on you\u000aIt's sharp and bright, and Apple also switched the bezels to black to match the rest of the Retina MacBook lineup. Those bezels are thin, too, so the combination makes the screen feel really big. You can set the resolution all the way up to 1440 x 900, so it's effectively giving you the same real estate as the 13-inch MacBook Air. You can\u2019t crank it up to the full resolution, but you wouldn\u2019t want to anyway, since it would make everything way too small.\u000aThe Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object. It has tiny pads that detect pressure, and then an electromagnet inside that simulates the feel of a click when you press down. So when the laptop is off, you feel nothing. When it's on, click. It's all in service of thinness \u2014 and some clever software features.\u000aYou can set the click strength in settings and also turn on a bunch of unique features for it in OS X. Force clicking (as it's called) lets you open up web page previews on links or definitions for words. You can also step through fast-forward speeds on videos and even feel some haptic feedback in a select few apps, like iMovie. Honestly, none of those software tricks felt very intuitive to me. But the trackpad itself felt completely natural, easily up to Apple's standards. In fact, it feels better than normal for a MacBook, since you can now click on the very top of it as easily as the bottom.\u000aThe Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object\u000aThere are other inventions, too. Apple redesigned its batteries to be tiered, so they can cram more of them into the MacBook. The result is a claimed nine hours of battery life \u2014 a claim that's notably close to my experience. In our relatively light test, which reloads websites once a minute, this MacBook actually beat Apple's claims by about an hour or so. But when you're putting it under stress, you'll get a bit less, probably closer to eight hours.\u000aBut here's where the inventions, while impressive, begin to feel more like those compromises. Apple created an all new, tiny little circuit board to house all the microchips that power the MacBook. It means that it doesn't need a fan at all, but it also means that using the kind of processor we're used to on modern laptops isn't really tenable.\u000aInstead, the processor on the MacBook is an Intel Core M, clocked at 1.1GHz but with a Turbo Boost mode that can crank it up to more than twice as fast (and there are other, more expensive variants that can go even faster). Hence the compromises: the MacBook benchmarks at about the same level as a four-year-old MacBook Air. That sounds dire, but in my experience it doesn't feel anywhere near that slow \u2014 mostly.\u000aFast enough for most common tasks, but it gets warm if you push it\u000aBasically, if you do anything that\u2019s going to really tax the processor, this laptop probably isn't going to cut it for you. In that sense it's actually kind of like a Chromebook. It's fast enough for 70 percent of what I do, but a little slower than what I'm used to. For about 20 percent of what I do \u2014 mostly photo editing \u2014 it works but requires patience. But it's the last 10 percent that's hard: video editing, really big iPhoto libraries, basically anything processor-intensive can get rough.\u000aI'll also say that the Chrome browser is kind of the perfect app to show where the line is between "good enough" and "kind of slow." Chrome has really become something of a resource hog for me lately. It\u2019s not a problem most of the time, but load up enough tabs, and any computer will start to chug. On my MacBook Air, that happens at around 20 tabs. On the new MacBook, it\u2019s about half that.\u000aSafari runs much better, but the point is that the headroom for apps that hog resources is much smaller than what I'm used to. And in any case, the fact that it's fanless means that the laptop gets warm. I wouldn't say hot, but it\u2019s definitely riding that line of comfort for bare legs. Fortunately, the heat is localized to where that processor cranking into turbo boost is located: on the bottom, near the back.\u000aThe tiny board, the fanless design, the fact that it can power this Retina display at all \u2014 all these inventions are impressive. But being impressed and being able to get work done are not the same thing. It's a compromise I can't promise you is okay unless you're sure you're not going to push a machine beyond the basics and can stand to wait for those times when you need to.\u000aWhich leads me to the last invention / compromise: the new MacBook has a new port, called USB Type-C. It's also the only port besides the headphone jack. You use it for power and for connecting your phone, monitor, printer, camera, or whatever else you might have. And because it's a brand new kind of plug, you will need adapters for all of those things.\u000aSay you want to charge your computer, plug in your iPhone, and plug in an external monitor. That's a totally natural thing to want to do! To pull it off, you are going to need to have the right dongle \u2014 and you\u2019re going to need to buy it, too, since they don\u2019t come in the box. They're just beginning to come on the market now, and I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll be both cheap and plentiful, but so far I've only been able to use the basic ones. So, just by way of example, right now I can't plug my Apple MacBook into my Apple Cinema Display because I don\u2019t have a dongle with Display Port on it.\u000aAgain, this is an invention and a compromise, and it's one that I'm actually a little torn on. USB Type-C has a legitimate chance of being the One Connector To Rule Them All. Google and Nokia are already using it, other phone and laptop manufacturers are on board, and from a technical standpoint it's a really great plug. It's strong, it\u2019s reversible, it's fast from both a data and power perspective, and it's not proprietary. I charged the new MacBook with Google's power adapter. Heck, I charged the new MacBook off one of those battery bricks that's meant to power an iPad.\u000aSure, I miss the safety of the MagSafe adapter, but being able to buy any number of chargers and adapters from whomever makes the cheapest or best ones is a big deal \u2014 and worth the tradeoff. Or will be, once USB Type-C takes hold.\u000aApple says that it designed the MacBook with the idea that soon you'll be able to connect everything wirelessly anyway. The iPhone can sync wirelessly or use AirDrop, lots of cameras support Wi-Fi, etc, etc. That all sounds nice, but I can tell you from painful experience that the dream of wireless peripherals is usually more like a waking nightmare of confusing sync settings, delays, and frustration. The MacBook supports Bluetooth 4.0 and an alphabet of Wi-Fi standards, but that's not enough, not yet.\u000aTalking to other Verge staffers about it, I joked that I'm looking forward to "Livin' La Vida Dongle." That's almost true! When it comes down to it, I mostly plug in power and only rarely need to use an SD card reader or plug in some other USB device. But when I need it, I need it, and having to carry a rat's nest of adapters and cables puts a huge damper on the portability of this machine.\u000aA lot of people remember the moment when Steve Jobs pulled the original MacBook Air out of that interoffice memo envelope. It was jaw-dropping. But it's easy to forget that the very first MacBook Air had problems \u2014 some of the very same problems as this new MacBook: not enough ports, slow, expensive. But the next version became the MacBook Air you know now, the one everybody either uses or copies. The one that changed laptops for five years.\u000aThis new MacBook is the future. All laptops are going to be like this someday: with ridiculously good screens, no fans, lasting all day. Just like the original MacBook Air defined a generation of competitors, this new MacBook will do the same. It, or something inspired by it, is what you'll be using in two or three years. It's that good.\u000aAll laptops are going to be like this someday\u000aHere's a crazy surprise I didn't expect: my 13-inch MacBook Air felt big and clunky after I went back to it. And make no mistake, the MacBook Air is itself a wonder of engineering. Yet compared to the new MacBook it felt like a heavy, kind of ugly throwback with a mediocre screen. I really didn't want to go back to that Air.\u000aBut I still went back.\u000aYou see, the problem with the future is that it isn't here yet. Instead we live in the now, and the now doesn't have the ecosystem of adapters and wireless peripherals I need to use this laptop with its single port. The now doesn't have the right processor to power through the apps I need without ruining battery life. And right now, this laptop is far from cheap at $1,299.\u000aBut if history is any guide, all of those problems will go away \u2014 and more quickly than you probably expect. When they do, I'll be using this MacBook. The MacBook. Hurry up, future. Hurry the hell up.\u000aPhotography by Sean O'Kane\u000a

VA group that wants to ban all sex work in Ireland is making fake Tinder profiles | The Verge

aVA group that wants to ban all sex work in Ireland is making fake Tinder profiles\u000aUsing the popular dating app in a duplicitous way\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aTinder is no longer just a way to quickly swipe through a bunch of photos of prospective mates: it's now also a place for opponents of sex work to promote their cause, at least in Ireland. Irish advertising agency  EightyTwenty just launched a controversial new campaign on Tinder that uses several fake profiles of actresses portraying women supposedly forced into sex work in the country.\u000aThe first few photos on these profiles are nothing out of the ordinary, but interested parties who swipe right to see more photos soon come across images of the women showing startlingly realistic simulated injuries and other signs of abuse. The final two images on each fake profile include a message decrying sex trafficking and a link to another organization,  Turn Off The Red Light , which seeks a full ban on all forms of sex work throughout all of Ireland. Up until recently, sex work was technically legal under Irish law, although public solicitation was not. Yet politicians in Northern Ireland  recently passed a bill that makes any exchange of money for sexual services illegal, even when the exchange is consensual.\u000aThere are several big issues with this campaign: the first and most obvious being that creating fake profiles would seem to go against  Tinder's own user guidelines . It's also an odd tactic to take to rally support for any cause: tricking people into believing what they're seeing are actual potential dating matches, only to find out they've been duped by a political campaign.\u000aBut most problematic is the conflation of human trafficking with consensual sex work. The group linked to in each of these fake Tinder profiles,  Turn Off The Red Light , claims that "very few women choose to willingly engage in prostitution. Most who are involved have had very few real choices." Sex trafficking is a very real and pervasive problem, but it is not the same as consensual sex work, as  the Human Trafficking Center notes . And the fact is that the  overwhelming majority of sex workers in Ireland are opposed to the ban on their services, and say that criminalizing their business \u2014 driving it out of the public regulatory framework \u2014 will only make it more unsafe. (The use of the term "prostitution" is also considered derogatory by many sex workers, so it's probably not the best choice for a group that claims to support women.) I've reached out to Tinder for a response to these actions and will update when I hear back.\u000a

VAlcatel's new Pixi smartphone can run Windows, Android, or Firefox OS | The Verge
p8
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aFresh off the news that  it's acquired the Palm brand , Alcatel has a new Pixi for us. It's not actually  the first Pixi from the budget phone maker, but it is pretty unique in its own right: the phone is compatible with three operating systems, being able to run Windows Phone, Android, or Firefox OS. The OS-agnostic Pixi 3 comes in four variants, with a 3.5-inch display 3G model, and three larger versions adding LTE and coming in at 4, 4.5, and 5 inches in size.\u000aThe company says the smartphones let owners use the same operating systems at work, at home, and on the move. The "affordable" phones might not rival top tier smartphones in terms of features and power, and the smallest 3.5-inch phone can only use 3G connections, but Alcatel says its users "don't want complicated systems \u2014 they want something familiar from their work environment in the office."\u000aThe three larger Pixis have LTE and a choice of operating systems\u000aBy opening the phones up to three different systems, it might be tricky for Alcatel to ensure a good user experience for every Pixi 3 owner, but the company at least has experience with all three operating systems.  Alcatel's previous Pixi phone uses Google's OS, its Fire phone from last year  uses Mozilla's , and  the company's POP 2 is a Windows Phone with a 64-bit processor. We'll know more about how they work when Alcatel shows the new phones off on the CES 2015 floor.\u000aThe Palm trademark  was sold in November to a shell company run by Nicolas Zibell, the Alcatel One Touch executive in charge of the American market \u2014 a move that indicates that the company may be trying to increase its presence in Western markets. Palm's return was recently teased by a new website, but for now at least, Alcatel's upcoming Pixi 3s don't bear the venerable brand name.\u000a

VA new Sony Walkman is coming to CES | The Verge

aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aA sign outside the grounds of the Las Vegas Convention Center here at CES shows a new Walkman-branded product from Sony, which would mark the second hyped Walkman release in just a few months' time after the  debut of the A17 last September . The new device looks like classic Sony design, featuring a curved, matte black shell highlighted by a gold-tone headphone jack and unusual placement of the transport controls \u2014 play / pause and track advance all appear to be placed along the edge. It looks like it could be an evolution of the  ZX1 , which retails for an astounding £549 ($841) in the UK.\u000aA Walkman renaissance?\u000aThe device may have been teased in the company's  "Welcome to the New World" video from several days ago. It was assumed that Sony was hinting at a new phone with references to Android Lollipop, a vibrant display, and high-quality audio, but many of the cues could just as easily apply to a new media player. If the A17 is any indication, this new Walkman will focus on high-quality audio \u2014 Sony has been trying to lead something of a digital audio renaissance lately, calling out support for 24-bit 192kHz sound files and high-quality amps.\u000aOf course, there's precious little evidence to suggest that people have the tolerance to carry a dedicated Walkman on top of a modern smartphone with solid audio quality of its own \u2014 but if this all means  a glorious return to Weird Sony , I can probably be convinced.\u000a

aVA brilliant Tinder hack made hundreds of bros unwittingly flirt with each other\u000a#BrosSwipingBros\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aMan is a thirsty beast, and nowhere is that thirst more acutely exemplified than on Tinder, the matchmaking app that lets users swipe right in their quest to find love, lust, bots, or viral marketers . Now a California-based programmer has tweaked the app\u2019s API, creating a catfish machine that fools men into thinking they\u2019re talking to women \u2014 when in fact they\u2019re talking with each other.\u000aLike other semi-anonymized digital spaces, Tinder creates a forum for individuals \u2014 namely men \u2014 to test the limits of aggressive and lewd behavior with seemingly little repercussion.\u000aAt Vox, we have a chat room dedicated to staffers\u2019 Tinder misadventures. It is a bleak landscape: women at the company have reported receiving a range of pick-up lines from the inane ("whats ur favorite beanie baby?"), to the bizarre ("Name a better song than Heartbreaker by the late Maria Carry" [sic]), to the gross and offensive and ("Those lips are so gorgeous that they make me wonder what your other set looks like").\u000aBut over the last few weeks, a California-based computer engineer \u2014 we\u2019ll call him Patrick \u2014 has pitted heterosexual male against heterosexual male. Patrick\u2019s program identifies two men who "like" one of his bait profiles (the first used prominent vlogger Boxxy's image; the second used an acquaintance who had given Patrick consent) and matched them to each other. The suitors\u2019 messages \u2014 some aggressive, others mundane, but all of them unabashedly flirtatious \u2014 are then relayed, back and forth, to one another through the dummy profile.\u000aTinder is notoriously vulnerable to hacks: in 2013, a loophole in the app could be harnessed to reveal users\u2019 locations to within 100 feet. Last summer, Valleywag reported on a number of techies who tweaked the system to automatically "mass-like" every girl they come across.\u000aPatrick was a Tinder user (in fact, it's where he met his current girlfriend) and says that female friends of his would often complain about the messages they received on Tinder. "The original idea was to throw that back into the face of the people doing it to see how they would react." Initially, he set out to build a Twitter bot that tweeted every first message a female friend received, but then he looked into Tinder\u2019s API and found it had little safeguard from more extensive tweaks.  "Tinder makes it surprisingly easy to bot their system. As long as you have a Facebook authentication token, you can behave as a robot as if you were a person."\u000aThe program made matches within minutes of activation; Patrick estimates he was overseeing 40 conversations within the first 12 hours. He developed code to scramble phone numbers and stepped in when a real-world meeting was imminent, but he also feels ambiguous about the ethics of the prank: "They ignore all the signs, they ignore all the weird things," he says of the users. "When someone is so quick to meet up without any detail or know anything about the person at all \u2014 maybe it\u2019s deserved."\u000aPatrick's exploit reveals the weakness of Tinder's API \u2014 but also shows what happens when men's desperation is turned on each other: some turn to anger, others are confused, and still others appreciate the humor of it. But above all, over and over, men breeze by every red flag that indicates they\u2019re not speaking with a woman. Evidently, the first symptom of extreme thirst is blindness.\u000aThe following screenshots of the dummy account were provided to The Verge.\u000aMy future ex-wife\u000a

VA Q&A with Dennis McCarthy, the man behind Furious 7's insane cast of cars | The Verge
p20
aVA Q&A with Dennis McCarthy, the man behind Furious 7's insane cast of cars\u000aDaddy went to work\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIn an industry flush with fancy cars, stunts, and fancy cars doing stunts, calling Dennis McCarthy "Hollywood's car guy" probably wouldn't be an overstatement.\u000aMcCarthy has served as car coordinator for five movies in the ever-growing Fast & Furious franchise, including Furious 7, which hits theaters next week. But F&F is far from his only credit: he's handled the rides for Taken 3, Man of Steel, Green Hornet, the upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, and many others. Considering that Furious 7 drops cars out of an aircraft and jumps a $3-plus million hypercar between two skyscrapers in Abu Dhabi, I thought it might be worth my time to investigate how this particular flavor of next-level ridiculousness comes together. I chatted with him briefly on the phone this week to get the dirt.\u000aChris Ziegler: What was the breakdown between practical effects and CGI in this film? In your estimation, is it up or down from previous movies in the series?\u000aDennis McCarthy: You know, I really feel that in Furious 7 there\u2019s less CGI. [You think] "My God, that\u2019s impossible," but the amazing thing is that a lot of it actually is possible, you know, in real life. So I would say that there\u2019s less CGI in Furious 7 than the previous ones.\u000aHow do you decide when to shoot something and when to render it? What does that conversation look like?\u000aThat\u2019s really a decision that\u2019s not mine to make, but I can just tell you what is behind the filmmakers on it. Basically, with these movies, you want to do as much as you can for real, because I think that makes a difference. It can look the same \u2014 sometimes it can\u2019t, sometimes it can \u2014 but even if it did look the same on the screen, I think what makes the movie a better film is doing the gag for real.\u000aI got a bunch of phone calls when the trailer came out. Everyone was calling me, "Hey man, did they really drive cars out of planes?" But the answer was yes! And people were just shocked to believe that. But that sequence happened over the Arizona desert with a C-130 and five cars \u2014 actually we had doubles of each, so we had 10 cars, and I think each car made either two or three drops out of that plane. You know, you see the trailer, you watch the Lykan HyperSport go from building to building\u2026 yeah, obviously we couldn\u2019t launch a car out of a building in Abu Dhabi, but the sets were as close to real as possible, the car was real, the jumps were real, the breaking glass was real, the stunt personnel scattering out of the way as the car slides through \u2014 you know, through the floor, all the real deal. So I think that it\u2019s important fans realize there\u2019s a lot more reality to these movies than one might expect.\u000a"We actually can\u2019t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air."\u000aWere there any requests that came in that you just absolutely could not handle as a practical effect? Did James [Wan] or anyone else on staff say, "Can we do this?" and you just said no, that\u2019s not possible?\u000aNo. I mean, there\u2019s always a couple incidents that are just not possible. But the question never really comes to me, because I think as that stuff is being developed, I think it\u2019s pretty obvious, "Okay, that\u2019s something that we actually can\u2019t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air." So, no, for the most part, if we can do real, we will, and like I said, it\u2019s always my goal to keep as much reality in the film as possible, because as a guy that loves car movies myself, that\u2019s what I look for.\u000aIf you\u2019re trying to do as much of this stuff in reality instead of in CGI as possible, you\u2019re probably damaging and destroying some pretty expensive cars. What\u2019s the most expensive car that you\u2019ve had to destroy on set?\u000aWell, I would say in this film, probably the most expensive car to build would\u2019ve been the off-road Charger that you see Dom back out of that airplane. As far as on-screen, visually, it\u2019d be the Lykan HyperSport. Though the cars that we had in the film weren\u2019t the actual production model Lykan HyperSport, they\u2019re basically a movie version that W Motors created for us or built for us. Still very pricey, but not $3.4 million like the actual car would cost.\u000aSo that\u2019s a different chassis and then a body on top that\u2019s designed to look like the real car, I would assume?\u000aThat\u2019s absolutely correct. What W Motors did is they used the exact same molds they use for their actual production car, but they built the car out of fiberglass as opposed to carbon fiber. The chassis, instead of being basically a Porsche race car, is a Porsche Boxster with the wheelbase stretched on it. So yeah, we basically built a car that looks 100 percent correct, or is as close to it as we possibly can, and doesn\u2019t wipe my budget out with just one vehicle.\u000aDo you ever run into any brand licensing issues with cars? Say if you destroy a particular car on set, has an automaker come to you and said, hey, we\u2019d rather you not do that?\u000aNo, not at all. That\u2019s something that\u2019s really taken care of from a whole different department. There is a licensing clearance department, and when these choices come up, there is someone that deals with that. But luckily, it\u2019s not me.\u000aWho\u2019s the best driver in the cast? And for that matter, how much driving does the cast actually get to do?\u000aThe cast does quite a bit of driving, but it\u2019s not the extreme stuff. They\u2019re not jumping the cars, they\u2019re not power-sliding the cars \u2014 they\u2019re doing all the drive-up stuff. The reason being isn\u2019t due to lack of skill, it\u2019s lack of time. So we have to have two units going at all times \u2014 so if there\u2019s a sequence where you\u2019re not going to see the driver of the car, there\u2019s no reason to waste Vin Diesel\u2019s or Michelle\u2019s time behind the wheel of that car. They can be somewhere else, maybe even in a different country filming a different part of the film.\u000aReally, the only cast members that I\u2019ve seen really push the limits would\u2019ve been Paul [Walker] and Vin Diesel. Vin Diesel can slide a car and put it on its mark every time without a problem. I know that they would all prefer to do more driving, but like I said, it would double our production time.\u000aSo this is not your first Fast & Furious film, right?\u000aThis is my fifth one. Three, Four, Five, Six, and now Seven.\u000aWhich has been your favorite to shoot?\u000aYou know, I would have to say Furious 7. They\u2019re getting better every time. Every movie we do, we try to raise that bar and increase the action and increase the number of cars and, you know, this one really jumped it up a couple of levels.\u000aHow did you get into this? What\u2019s your background?\u000aMy background is just building cars. I\u2019ve been into cars since an early age. I think when I was 16 years old, I worked at a speed shop. When I was in my early 20s, I opened my own business building cars. And like I said, it was just one of those things, built a couple different cars for a couple different films, and that led to what I\u2019m doing now.\u000aWould you say this is the most interesting car-focused movie franchise in history?\u000aAbsolutely. There\u2019s really nothing else that comes close to it. To have done seven movies, and they\u2019re all \u2014 every one is more successful than the last \u2014 just says a lot about what Fast & Furious is about.\u000a"It\u2019s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban."\u000aAs a car person, what\u2019s your personal daily driver? What do you take to and from the film sets?\u000aYou know, I have a lot of vehicles, and this is almost\u2026 it\u2019s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban. One, I have four kids, so it comes in handy, and two, I\u2019m always driving a bunch of my guys back and forth on set. So it\u2019s a very practical vehicle, but I do have a lot of other things that I drive when I\u2019m just out having a good time.\u000aDo you think that we\u2019re at the point where we can start [putting hybrid and electric vehicles in the franchise]?\u000aI think we are. I mean, it came close on this one. Prior to the Lykan HyperSport, I wanted the LaFerrari which is a hybrid car, and I was just unable to get it. That was my first choice prior to knowing about the Lykan HyperSport. Once I got that background, script-wise, it actually is a much better fit. But no, I think that\u2019s coming. Like you stated, these cars have made leaps and bounds in the last five years and the performance is amazing. So you know, we\u2019ll see. If Fast 8 happens and I get a script and there\u2019s a spot for it, I\u2019m going to try to get that in there.\u000aVerge Video: Waiting for Furious 7\u000a

aVA workout app made me a better gamer\u000aI didn\u2019t believe fitness apps had any point until I found one for myself\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAnyone that knows me knows that I like to exercise. I actively enjoy the physical exertion that others might consider a chore or a necessary evil . It's because I can't remember the last day that I went without exercising that I've generally taken a dim view of workout and fitness apps. I\u2019m fine without your help, I thought in my broccoli-addled hubris. This is one part of my life that doesn\u2019t need the aid of a digital assistant. I was, of course, wrong.\u000aThis past weekend, as I was busy installing and delighting in the novelty of Android 5 on my Nexus 5, I stumbled upon an app in Google\u2019s Play Store called Trackthisforme . It\u2019s ridiculously simple in both its design and function: I just punch in units of whatever it is I want to track and it keeps daily totals that are then turned into pretty line graphs. It\u2019s also ridiculously powerful.\u000aTough lesson number one: I wasn't exercising as often as I'd imagined\u000aThe first thing I learned from Trackthisforme is that I don\u2019t work out as much as I think I do. Working from home, I find brief but regular exercises like pushups and squats to be the best way to stay in shape, but it turns out I\u2019ve overestimated the regularity with which I do them. In my mind, I\u2019m doing a set of pushups every hour, but according to Trackthisforme, I\u2019m doing them every two or three hours. I also don\u2019t usually count my reps, instead doing a certain set until my muscles fail or I get bored, but this app quickly disciplined me and \u2014 through my innate fastidiousness about neat round numbers \u2014 got me to do more reps in each set. Two days in and I\u2019ve already got a much better idea of my own habits than I\u2019ve had in all the preceding months.\u000aHumans typically like numbers best when they are growing. That\u2019s why we obsess over sportspeople\u2019s stats and World of Warcraft hero levels -\u2014 and it\u2019s why I was so immediately and hopelessly addicted to adding more data to Trackthisforme. It\u2019s just plain satisfying to beat your own high score. The brilliant thing is that for me to indulge this habit, I have to become more focused and consistent in the way I do the things that I am tracking. In order to beat myself, I have to become better, which is essentially the entire point of self-improvement.\u000aBetter health means better everything\u000aI didn\u2019t expect any of this to make me better at playing video games, though. And yet it has: I\u2019ve lost only two Dota 2 matches all weekend (where a dozen would be a more common number), I\u2019ve set new high scores in Bejeweled 3 (a game that never gets the credit it deserves), and I generally feel sharper and quicker with my reactions than usual. I still don\u2019t get enough sleep and I haven\u2019t changed what I eat; the only thing that\u2019s different is that I\u2019m now paying attention when exercising. I\u2019m also pushing myself that little bit harder and getting out of breath more often, which might be as much as my body needs to give my mental acuity a boost.\u000aI've never lacked motivation, but now I have rigor and focus too\u000aThere\u2019s no shortage of studies showing the beneficial relationship between physical activity and brain health. Even though I\u2019ve always been cognizant and motivated to stay active, this app has added a layer of quantified rigor that I\u2019d previously been missing. I can\u2019t be sure if its appeal will stand the test of time, but it has certainly opened my mind to the usefulness of quantifying and gamifying my exercise. Being late to the party isn\u2019t going to stop me from enjoying it.\u000aNumbers brought clarity and visibility to my daily routine, which in turn helped me quickly improve it. I thought I was doing fine before, but now I feel better and healthier for letting a bit of simple technology into my life. I\u2019m keenly aware that I\u2019m working from a small sample size and could just be enjoying a placebo effect from having another set of numbers I can improve \u2014 this wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near as fun without the automated graphs and daily comparisons \u2014 but I don\u2019t really care. Adding this extra game to my life has made me better at everything else that I play, and that\u2019s what matters to me.\u000a
