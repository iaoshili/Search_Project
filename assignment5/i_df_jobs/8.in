V10 things to expect at Mobile World Congress\u000aThere will be phones\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aEvery year, tens of thousands of reporters, analysts, and suited-up businesspeople descend upon Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress trade show. Mobile World Congress, or MWC if you're in the know, is the largest trade show for mobile technology: phones, networks, hotspots, infrastructure, and more phones.\u000aIn recent years, MWC has been fairly sleepy, shifting from a consumer-centric show with big product launches to a more business-focused one that catered to infrastructure announcements. But this year it appears the show will swing back in the other direction: there are lots of companies that will be at MWC this year, and some major product announcements are expected to drop.\u000aThe fun starts on Sunday, and we'll be there covering it on the ground with hands-on reports, live blogs, video, and more. All of our coverage will be neatly organized in our special MWC 2015 hub (bookmark it!). But to whet your appetite for now, here are nine things plus one wildcard we expect to see at this year's MWC.\u000aExpect phones. Lots and lots of phones.\u000aSamsung will have two new phones\u000aLike last year, Samsung is hosting a big press event on Sunday. Also like last year, Samsung\u2019s announcements have largely leaked: it appears that the company will possibly announce two phones , one being the Galaxy S6 and the other being an Edge version with curved sides. There\u2019s still a chance that Samsung has a surprise or two in store, so we\u2019ll be there at Samsung\u2019s Unpacked event to report it all.\u000aHTC will have one new phone\u000aHTC is also hosting a press event on Sunday, where it\u2019s expected to announce the One M9, the successor to last year\u2019s M8. In fact, the M9 is all but guaranteed to be announced, and it seems that virtually everything about the phone has already leaked , so we\u2019ll have to see if the company has anything else up its sleeve for its press event. Perhaps it will pull out something related to its recent partnership with fitness clothing company Under Armour ?\u000aMozilla will advance Firefox OS, a little\u000aMozilla often uses MWC to showcase new advancements in its Firefox OS platform, and sure enough, the company is hosting an event on Sunday to do just that. It\u2019s not yet clear exactly what we\u2019ll see there, but since Firefox is firmly positioned for entry-level markets, we don\u2019t expect fireworks.\u000aLG will show off a watch\u000aLG doesn\u2019t have nearly the presence of HTC or Samsung this year, and it just launched the G Flex 2 at CES in January. We\u2019re not expecting much in the way of flagship devices, but LG has already announced updates to its mid-range phones. Oh, and maybe we\u2019ll get a better look at LG\u2019s Urbane LTE webOS (or is it?) smartwatch.\u000aMicrosoft may give us a closer look at Windows 10 on phones\u000aMicrosoft is hosting a press event on Monday morning where it will surely announce some new products. This is the first Mobile World Congress since Microsoft closed its acquisition of Nokia\u2019s phone business, but we\u2019re not expecting anything huge in terms of new hardware. Sources tell us that Microsoft will announce two mid-range Windows Phone handsets, a 5-inch Lumia 640, and a larger Lumia 1330. Chances are the only new Windows Phone devices we\u2019ll see at MWC will be from Microsoft itself. But Microsoft is likely saving its higher-end phones for later this year when Windows 10 drops.\u000aGoogle will give a keynote speech\u000aGoogle doesn\u2019t often make big announcements at trade shows, and it\u2019s not done much of anything at MWC in year\u2019s past. But this year, head of product Sundar Pichai is giving a 45-minute talk on Monday, and he could very well use that to announce some new products or initiatives.\u000aSony will show off a tablet\u000aSony usually uses CES for its big phone unveils, but it looks like the company will trot out a new Z4 tablet at this year's MWC. An early leak of the device shows a typical Sony design with an ultra-thin profile. Sony is also likely to announce new mid-range and low-end smartphones, but we\u2019re not expecting a Z4 flagship phone at this show.\u000aMotorola will show its low-end chops\u000aMotorola just this week announced its second-generation Moto E , a welcome update to one of the best entry-level phones you can buy. Given that, we don\u2019t expect the company to do much at MWC, and a press event is not planned.\u000aBlackBerry will talk about future devices\u000aIn the past few months, BlackBerry finally started refreshing its device lineup, with the launch of the Passport and Classic before the end of 2014. CEO John Chen said at CES that it would be providing guidance on its future device plans at MWC, and the company has scheduled a press event for Tuesday where he\u2019ll likely do just that. Rumors have said that despite committing itself back to hardware keyboards, BlackBerry is working on a new all-touchscreen device that it may show off next week.\u000aValve may surprise us with VR\u000aValve is a bit of a dark horse here. As a gaming company, it\u2019s not usually associated with Mobile World Congress. But Valve will be at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, which runs concurrent to MWC, to show off new head-mounted virtual reality gear. That begs the question, what phone companies might Valve partner with for this head-mounted VR platform? It\u2019s a long shot, but perhaps we\u2019ll find out at MWC.\u000aLearn more\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aRobots are becoming an ever-increasing presence in our lives, and today one will board a commercial airline as a passenger for the first time. According to the Los Angeles International Airport's  Twitter feed , a humanoid robot named Athena will take off on a commercial Lufthansa flight to Germany this afternoon as a paid passenger. Athena is going to be accompanied by two scientists and is a full humanoid robot with a head, arms, and legs. It remains to be seen if Athena is the kind of passenger you'll want to sit next to, but at least on this flight it sounds like it'll be flanked by scientists instead of normal jet-setters.\u000aJust a few minutes ago, Athena started the check-in process at LAX, something that was captured and broadcast via the airport's Twitter account. It looks like Athena somehow came by a German passport (or it could simply be a passport for the accompanying scientist):\u000a"Athena" is checking in for her seat aboard @lufthansa on her way to Germany! [PIC]. Have you seen her yet? pic.twitter.com/6pYHiQLC9a\u000a\u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) December 15, 2014\u000aAt the end of the day, though, Athena taking up a seat on a commercial airline isn't wildly different than anyone else paying for an extra seat for large, bulky, or fragile cargo \u2014 musicians commonly will pay for a seat for their instruments, for example. Despite that technicality, however, passengers and other airport patrons probably got a kick out of seeing a robot head through the hellish process that is airport security.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Star Wars movies are coming to smartphones. All six movies \u2014 yes, even The Phantom Menace, unfortunately \u2014 will be launched on digital video services such as iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Instant Video, and Xbox Video around the world on April 10th,  Disney and Lucasfilm announced today . The launch will allow fans to buy Digital HD versions of the movies individually, or get them all at once as part of the Star Wars Digital Movie Collection.\u000aThe six movies each come with bonus features, including documentaries, interviews with production staff, deleted scenes, and closer looks at the films' models and sets. Some digital retailers are also offering extra incentives to buy the movies from their marketplace \u2014 get the entire collection  from Xbox Video and you'll earn a digital R2-D2 to accompany your creepy, blank-faced Xbox Live avatar, a pinball table for the free-to-play Pinball FX 2, and access to an Xbox-only featurette.\u000aBuy the collection on Xbox Video to earn an imaginary R2-D2\u000aA number of digital retailers have yet to specify the price for the collection, but the whole bundle is available for $89 on the Google Play store, with individual movies going for $19.99. There were  rumors last year that Disney was planning to re-release the original Star Wars movies on Blu-ray without George Lucas' CGI spot-welding, but viewers don't appear to be able to choose which version of the movie they want to watch with the upcoming Digital HD editions. Purchasers of the new versions will have to cope with unconvincing Dewbacks, Han having the gall to step on Jabba's tail, and the disconcerting sight of a moody Hayden Christensen as Vader's ghost at the Endor feast. At least they'll be in high resolution.\u000aVerge Video: Star Wars- Episode VII adds new cast and Millenium Falcon\u000a

VAlfred turns your iPad or iPhone into a remote control for your Mac\u000aAnother power tool for power users\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aA new app  available in the iOS App Store today will let you configure your iPhone or iPad as a kind of supercharged remote control for your Mac. Called  Alfred Remote , it essentially offers you multiple panels of buttons to do things like launch apps, control iTunes, turn on your screen saver, perform custom searches, paste text snippets, and do much nerdier things if you put your mind to it. It's $4.99, and it's designed to be paired with Alfred for the Mac, a free app with an in-app upgrade of £17 (around $25 US).\u000aPowerful, but only if you configure it\u000aI've long  been an apologist for Alfred , a Mac utility that lets you supercharge a text box into something that can control your entire computer and connect it to the web in surprising and interesting ways. It's a tool that initially looks like a nerdy version of Yosemite's Spotlight search feature until you start digging in, where you'll find customizable clipboards and workflows that let you do insane, powerful things. It's not the easiest thing to configure, but if you take some time with it, it's great.\u000aI've been using Alfred Remote for a few days now, and while I'm impressed by its stability and functionality, I'm not sure that it will become as essential to my workflow as the main Mac app. With Alfred Remote, you get a pre-configured set of shortcuts and system commands that seem to work as if by magic, immediately and instantly causing your Mac to do things.\u000aBut whether Alfred Remote succeeds or fails for you depends entirely on whether you take the time to configure more "things" for your Mac to do. The basics of launching apps and even pasting pre-configured text snippets by tapping a button on your iPad seem whiz-bang the first time, but then only marginally better than using the keyboard commands that are already literally at your fingertips when you're using a Mac. Given that you need to have your iPad or iPhone on, unlocked, and in the app, it can seem a little silly. And unless you're already an Alfred power user on the Mac, you probably won't find much utility in it.\u000aBut then I started thinking of things that are a pain to do on my Mac, and Alfred Remote started to make more sense. I have a couple dozen text snippets I use constantly but can never remember the short cuts for them. I have a dozen more complicated "Workflows" that perform complex searches and actions in very specific apps. I have a bunch of Applescripts that I can never seem to find quickly enough. I never remember to lock my stupid computer when I walk away from it. I definitely lost hours of my Sunday playing around with ideas for buttons that could do magic things on my Mac.\u000aWith varying levels of difficulty, Alfred Remote can be set up for all of that. Unfortunately, at the nerdier end of the spectrum you will need to figure out a fairly complex interface to get it done. Alfred's most powerful features are called "Workflows," which let you string together different commands by drawing lines and adding scripts. They're cool, but they require a power user mindset that isn't quite in keeping with the simplicity of the iOS App Store. You can create your own workflows or dive into  Alfred's forums (or a new repository for them called  Packal ). Alfred suggested a couple \u2014 for controlling Spotify or Powerpoint \u2014 but eventually I just decided to start making my own. You can't enter text into Alfred Remote; you can only set up buttons that do specific tasks. That can make for a steep learning curve to climb, and the benefits of doing so are either immediately obvious or shrug-inducing, without much between those two extremes.\u000aI love Alfred on the Mac so much that I've reconfigured my Caps Lock key to launch it instead of making uppercase letters. I haven't yet decided if I love Alfred Remote enough to put it on my iPad's home screen. Maybe if I spend more time configuring it, I'll know. If there's anything Alfred knows, it's that power users spend as much time obsessing about their tools as they do actually using them.\u000a

VShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIt's not very often that Apple welcomes reporters through its doors, let alone allows them to spend a significant amount of time with some of its chief employees. But last year, The New Yorker had a chance to visit and speak with Jony Ive, Apple's design chief, and the magazine has just published a long profile of him. You can read the entire piece  over at The New Yorker's website , but we've pulled out a few of the more interesting bits of information that we learned about Jony Ive, the Apple Watch, and more while reading through it:\u000aIve has a Banksy poster in his office\u000aDecorations in Ive's office include: a Playmobil likeness of himself, a rugby ball, a  design poster that ends with the phrase "think about all the fucking possibilities," and  a Banksy print of the Queen overlaid with the face of a chimp.\u000aIve helped J.J. Abrams design Star Wars' new lightsaber\u000aThough Abrams and his team created the initial design of the new lightsaber on their own,  Ive gave Abrams some "very specific" suggestions after seeing it \u2014 and those suggestions will apparently factor into the final cut of the movie. Ive appears to have pushed for the weapon to be a bit more analog and primitive, "less precise and just a little bit more spitty," Abrams says. Ive apparently had no comment on the controversial cross guard.\u000aIve is into cars (and hates Toyotas)\u000aThis should fuel plenty of speculation now that Apple is  reported to be working on a car . The New Yorker's profile says that both Ive and his design pal / new coworker Marc Newson are really into cars, but they're apparently  pretty disappointed with what's currently on the road.\u000a"There are some shocking cars on the road," Ive said. "One person\u2019s car is another person\u2019s scenery." To his right was a silver sedan with a jutting lower lip. Ive said, quietly, "For example." As the disgraced car fell behind, I asked Ive to critique its design: "It is baffling, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just nothing, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just insipid." He declined to name the model, muttering, "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to offend." (Toyota Echo.)\u000aThat's not even the only dig at Toyota in the piece. It also mentions:\u000aJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of operations, drives an old Toyota Camry. Ive\u2019s verdict, according to Williams, is "Oh, God."\u000aIve owns an Aston Martin DB4, but he's currently riding around in a Bentley Mulsanne. Ive says that he loves Bentleys entirely because of their design. He also says that he's always been kind of torn about Bentleys' "other connotations" (presumably: implying that their owners are crazy rich).\u000aIve doesn't like Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography\u000aIve tells The New Yorker that he's only seen parts of the biography, but that it's enough for him to dislike it on the basis of inaccuracies. "My regard couldn\u2019t be any lower," he said.\u000aIve (seemingly) isn't thrilled about the iPhone 6's camera bump\u000aThe iPhone 6's protruding camera lens is kind of annoying \u2014 and a little bit ugly \u2014 making it a surprising sight on a product out of Ive's lab. It's perhaps no surprise that Ive doesn't seem totally happy about its presence. He tells The New Yorker that it is "a really very pragmatic optimization." He continues: "And, yeah..."\u000aApple considered making a larger iPhone 4\u000aIt took Apple a long time \u2014 arguably, a bit too long \u2014 to get on board with the large cellphone trend. But according to Ive, Apple was thinking about it far earlier than the company actually began to make one. His studio had apparently designed a larger smartphone based on the iPhone 4, but the results were "clunky" and "uncompelling," so Apple never made it.\u000aIve doesn't care for Google Glass (and neither does Tim Cook)\u000aThis probably isn't a surprise, but Ive thinks that a smartwatch is a better solution for notifications than a display in your glasses.\u000aWhen he later saw Google Glass, Ive said, it was evident to him that the face "was the wrong place." Cook said, "We always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we\u2019ve always believed." He went on, "We always thought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has." He looked at the Apple Watch on his wrist. "This isn\u2019t obnoxious. This isn\u2019t building a barrier between you and me."\u000aIve probably isn't a fan of Moto Maker\u000aIve asked The New Yorker not to name what product he's talking about here, but we can make a good guess:\u000aIn one of our conversations, Ive was scathing about a rival\u2019s product, after asking me not to name it: "Their value proposition was \u2018Make it whatever you want. You can choose whatever color you want.\u2019 And I believe that\u2019s abdicating your responsibility as a designer."\u000aTim Cook may not love Beats' hardware design\u000aCook loves to talk about Beats Music and its playlists. We haven't heard him talk about Beats headphones very much. This might be the reason why:\u000aWhen I spoke to Cook, he lauded Beats\u2019 music-streaming service and its personnel before praising its hardware. "Would Jony have designed some of the products?" he said. "Obviously, you can look at them and say no." He went on, "But you\u2019re not buying it for what it is\u2014you\u2019re buying it for what it can be."\u000aThe Apple Watch still needs some work\u000aTo conserve battery life, the Apple Watch's screen stays off until its wearer lifts their wrist up to look at it \u2014 but apparently Apple was far from perfecting this feature as of the watch's unveiling.\u000aIn the prototypes worn around the Cupertino campus at the end of last year, this feature was still glitchy. For Marc Newson, it took three attempts\u2014an escalation of acting styles, from naturalism to melodrama\u2014before his screen came to life.\u000aThe Apple Watch may eventually come in more materials\u000aIve tells The New Yorker that he believes people are "okay or okay to a degree" with carrying around the same phone as everyone else, but that people will not accept this with a product that they're going to wear around. That's why his lab decided to use different materials for different models of the Apple Watch, including aluminum, stainless steel, and gold. Notably, while discussing the materials that they've explored using, Ive adds, "We\u2019ve not stopped."\u000aAn Ultrasuede cloth may come with some models of the Apple Watch\u000aOne designer in Ive's lab proposed including an "orangey-brown" color of the cloth with models of the gold Apple Watch. Ive dismissed the color choice as something you'd find in a cheap student apartment. The idea of including a cloth, however, appears to remain on the table.\u000aThe Apple Watch was always going to be rectangular\u000aWatch enthusiasts may have been hoping for a classically styled circular watch, but Apple ended up unveiling a sightly rectangular one on stage last year. Apparently, that wasn't purely for technological reasons \u2014 Ive actually thinks that a circular face doesn't make sense for what you'll be doing on it. That's because a "huge part of the function is lists," he says, so "a circle doesn\u2019t make any sense."\u000aThe Apple Watch prompted a store redesign\u000aAngela Ahrendts, Apple's senior VP of retail and the former CEO of Burberry, is working on a redesign of Apple's retail stores ahead of the smartwatch launch. It's not stated how significant or slight these changes may be, but Apple clearly believes that a different experience is needed to sell a premium watch. As The New Yorker puts it, "These new spaces will surely become a more natural setting for vitrines filled with gold (and perhaps less welcoming, at least in some corners, to tourists and truants)."\u000aThe Apple Watch is more Ive's than any previous Apple product\u000aThat's according to Jeff Williams (who drives the Camry). Ive reportedly encountered resistance at Apple while pitching the Watch project: some at the company were concerned about how a watch would be displayed in stores; they were also worried that it might create a divide between more and less wealthy customers. Ive finally convinced Apple and formally began working on the smartwatch in fall of 2011, around the time the iPhone 4S was released.\u000a

VA Tale of Two Drakes\u000aA fictional account of Drake twins\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aDrake wakes up. He looks out his sizable bedroom window and across his swelling, well-manicured grounds while thinking about his saltwater pool. It's so big. Bigger than most pools. Maybe he will go swimming today. He turns around and notices a man lying in his bed. A beautiful man, with pristine facial hair and a thick neck. He looks closer at the man. Poreless. He touches the man's skin and feels a hand on his own face. This man is him. This man is Drake.\u000aScene 1: Drake and Drake get margaritas\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aJun 6, 2013 at 4:32pm PDT\u000aDrake is thirsty, so Drake and Drake decide to go get drinks. They go to a T.G.I.Friday's because Drake appreciates the taxidermy on the walls and empathizes with the crowds of office drones eating spinach dip at 11AM.\u000aDRAKE: Have you ever noticed the propensity of all humankind to categorically sabotage the very essence of the particularities and idiosyncrasies that make us truly unique? It muddles the mind. "Personality is only ripe when a man has made the truth his own." I think Kierkegaard said that.\u000aDRAKE: He did say that. Do you want to split the BBQ wrap?\u000aScene 2: Drake and Drake wear Drake shirts\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aFeb 26, 2014 at 11:54am PST\u000aDrake and Drake have successfully gotten drunk on the sweet and salty faux-marg orgy offered on the T.G.I.Friday's menu, so they decide to celebrate their joint existence with matching t-shirts.\u000aDRAKE: These shirts are great. You look great, Drake. I look okay.\u000aDRAKE: I sometimes wonder about the inescapable futility of bespoke clothing, and how, rather than arming us with the tools we need to combat an ever-aggressive capitalist society, they merely subdue us into a state of mimed complacency. But no, you look better than okay.\u000aScene 3: One of the Drakes finds love\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aMay 17, 2014 at 12:15pm PDT\u000aOne of the Drakes meets a woman while out on a morning jog. She jogs alongside him. They are fluid; perfectly in sync. They fall in love. Love shrinks Drake's world, and his time spent with other Drake becomes more and more infrequent.\u000aDRAKE: I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 you could do better. Tell me have you heard that lately? Additionally, have you ever considered that love is a deranged experiment created by corporate slogs to see just how much unending torture the human brain can endure?\u000aDRAKE: But I love you, Drake. That's not an experiment.\u000aScene 4: The Drakes have a falling out, and then a reunion\u000aA photo posted by Drake featuring Drake (@draketwins) on\u000aApr 30, 2013 at 12:06pm PDT\u000aThe Drakes are getting ready for bed. Drake is reading Elena Ferrante's The Days of Abandonment. Drake is still in love, but he's worried about Drake. Other Drake is moody and cold.\u000aDRAKE: I love how Ferrante uses gendered diffusion of responsibility and the trappings of mental fragility without ever rendering her protagonist a pitiful caricature of female struggle. Perhaps you should be more like Ferrante, Drake.\u000aDRAKE: I would like you to consider the possibility that you may be overreacting.\u000aDRAKE: And I would like you to consider the possibility that there is no stronger bond than ours. No intangible feeling of sensuality and companionship can usurp our core design of sameness. I love you, and I'm going to bed.\u000aDRAKE: Goodnight, sleep well. Don't let the absurdity and meaninglessness of life deprive you of the satisfaction and joy which inexplicably arise nevertheless.\u000aThis has been A Tale of Two Drakes: fan fiction inspired by the  Drake Twins Instagram account .\u000aVerge Video: McLaren's "low-end" 570s is incredible\u000a

VA paid version of Tinder is reportedly launching today\u000aTinder Plus adds undo button and passport feature, for a price\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aTinder will introduce a paid version of its popular dating app on Monday,  TechCrunch reports . The paid version,  known as Tinder Plus , adds two main features: a "rewind" option that lets users reconsider the last person they rejected ("left-swiped"), and a passport function that lets them swipe in different cities. Citing sources familiar with the situation, TechCrunch reports that the paid version will be available for under $10 in the US, though prices will reportedly vary across different markets.\u000aPaying for the service will also remove ads, which are reportedly launching on Tinder's network later this month. Last week,  Recode reported that the Los Angeles-based startup is building an ad product that will be led by Brian Norgard, who co-founded the Tappy ephemeral messaging app that Tinder  acquired earlier this year .\u000aTinder has been testing an "unlimited like" feature in Tinder Plus in recent weeks. It's terrible.\u000aThe company has been testing Tinder Plus across Europe over the past few weeks, with prices ranging from $0.99 to $19.99 per month. I was forced to update to the freemium version of the app last week, which limits my likes unless I pay $9.99 per month. Last month, the company said it was  beta testing the 24-hour right-swipe limit as a way to crack down on porn-y spambots, but as  Business Insider notes , the feature has resulted in some rather negative feedback in App Store reviews.\u000aIt's not yet clear whether limited likes will be included in the version of Tinder Plus that launches today. (TechCrunch makes no mention of it in its report.) A Tinder spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u000a
