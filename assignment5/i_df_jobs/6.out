VAction movies need to stop spoiling their best moments | The Verge
p2
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aWe've entered an era of ludicrous movie marketing, one where marketing teams release  teasers for teasers of movie posters. There's so much disincentive to go to a movie theater \u2014 high prices, low comfort, terrible peers \u2014 that studios are trying insanely hard at every point during a film's lifecycle to build maximum hype. And it's completely ruining my ability to suspend disbelief.\u000aThe newest example is the trailer \u2014 excuse me, " teaser " \u2014 for the newest Mission Impossible movie, Rogue Nation, which was released yesterday (the full trailer was released today). It's essentially just a minute's worth of what will probably be some of the film's best stunts. But I want to talk about one moment in particular that has set the internet ablaze: Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt hanging from the side of a giant plane.\u000aCruise's stunt with the shots of Simon Pegg removed\u000aThat's an awesome concept, stunt, and shot sequence. And it's also a scene that is now completely ruined for me. Imagine what experiencing that scene would feel like if you had no idea it was coming, and the first time you saw it happen was in front of a 30-foot-tall theater screen, surrounded by a similarly clueless audience.\u000aWhat's worse is that Yahoo just published a conveniently timed interview with Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie that breaks down exactly how they pulled it off. (To be fair, paparazzi photos of the stunt have been around since last fall, but that's a wholly separate issue.) Sure, there is a thrill in knowing for certain that it was a real stunt and not done with computers. Maybe knowing the stunt was actually performed by Cruise will increase the thrill when you see this stunt on the big screen, instead of you shrugging off any excitement because the assumption all spectacular shots must be faked.\u000aFilmmakers must sell me on the reality of the film\u000aI take issue with that line of thinking for two reasons. First is the notion that the filmmakers must sell me on the reality of the film. Take for a example a superhero film: I shouldn't have to think about how ridiculous it is that I'm watching an adult dressed in a rubber suit punching another adult in a rubber suit. The filmmakers can convince me to care by building a world with clear rules (and exceptions), presenting broad themes for me to chew on during the whole experience, and deploying great dialogue alongside thoughtful cinematography. McQuarrie might attempt all these with Rogue Nation, but the marketing for the movie has thwarted his efforts before the first ticket's been sold.\u000aSecond, the idea of a collective, in-the-know thrill is akin to that of the first drop on a roller coaster. Sure, it's exhilarating, and the anticipation while you slowly climb to the first big drop you know is coming brings its own type of excitement \u2014 but it's fleeting. The real fun comes after the ride starts, found in the twists and turns you can't see coming because you're having too much fun holding on for dear life.\u000aMany of you have probably already muttered "well don't watch the trailer," to which I respond that I usually don't! When I found out that a director whose work I loved was making a sci-fi movie called Looper starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt, I spent four years militantly avoiding every poster and trailer. Every time the television spot for Interstellar began I literally covered my ears and closed my eyes. My experience with both of those movies wound up feeling refreshingly clean, but that's an absurd way to live. It really shouldn't be this hard to enjoy a movie on your own terms.\u000aIt really shouldn't be this hard to enjoy a movie on your own terms\u000aThe thing is, this isn't changing any time soon. A pattern has emerged. Earlier this month, we saw an unbelievable scene unfold in one of the first trailers for Furious 7. Barely a week later Universal Studios published a featurette that showed how the stunt was performed. (Meanwhile Furious 7 won't be in theaters until April.) And this is just one of myriad ways that studios are trying to build hype.\u000aThese movie studios are revealing more and more of their movies because they're increasingly desperate to turn a profit. The industry is in its own action film right now, replete with high risk climbs and dives. With increased risk that films won't make their money back post release, more marketing muscle gets put into promotions. Like some of the best stunts, studios only get one shot at opening weekend.\u000aThese kinds of stunts are the reason I want to see a big-budget action movie in the first place, but by the time I'm seated in the theater I'm all too familiar with what's going to happen. I'm left stuck in a cinema ouroboros: I want to see fewer movies because of marketing, and I get more marketing because people see fewer movies.\u000a

aVAlcatel's Pixi phones can't actually triple-boot into different operating systems\u000aBut a super-cheap phone with LTE is still worth paying attention to\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAlcatel Onetouch announced the third generation of its Pixi line of smartphones a few days ago and offered up the intriguing possibility of a phone that could  run three different operating systems . Now we've gotten a chance to check out the new Pixi family and unfortunately got some bad news \u2014 users won't be able to boot between Android, Firefox OS, and Windows Phone. Alcatel told us that the multi-OS mode is more of an offering for carrier partners to fill out their lineups with phones running their preferred OS rather than something a buyer will be able to play around with.\u000aThat unfortunate omission means there isn't a whole for the Pixi family to hang their hat on, at least for those of us used to huge and powerful smartphones. Alcatel described these phones as their most entry-level devices, and it shows \u2014 they're thick, not very pleasant to hold, and have no discernible standout hardware features. The 3.5-inch model has the same screen resolution of the iPhone 3GS, which was released back in 2009, the 4-inch model comes in at 800 x 480, and the 4.5- and 5-inch models feature 854 x 400 screens. That's a far cry from the 720p and 1080p screens that've become commonplace, and the relatively low resolution isn't the only problem with these displays. They're just not that pleasant to look at.\u000aAlcatel is competing with the Moto E, not the Moto X\u000aOf course, these phones aren't meant to compare with the Nexus 6 or Moto X \u2014 they're meant to be incredibly low-cost devices that help bring connected smartphones to more and more people. To that end, it's worth noting that three of the four Pixi models will run on LTE networks, a pretty big inclusion for an inexpensive phone. Indeed, while the  cheap but surprisingly good Moto E feels like a much higher-quality device overall, it doesn't include LTE support. And while these phones aren't much to look at, they were pretty responsive in the quick amount of time we had to play with them.\u000aI'd probably still recommend a Moto E over the Pixi series, but these could still be viable options for anyone looking for a dirt-cheap, unlocked smartphone with LTE on board. While we're disappointed not to have a cheap phone that can triple-boot into different smartphone operating systems, an inexpensive and reasonably capable LTE phone could still be a meaningful product to a huge market of potential customers.\u000a

V'Athena' is the first humanoid robot to be a paying airline passenger | The Verge
p8
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aRobots are becoming an ever-increasing presence in our lives, and today one will board a commercial airline as a passenger for the first time. According to the Los Angeles International Airport's  Twitter feed , a humanoid robot named Athena will take off on a commercial Lufthansa flight to Germany this afternoon as a paid passenger. Athena is going to be accompanied by two scientists and is a full humanoid robot with a head, arms, and legs. It remains to be seen if Athena is the kind of passenger you'll want to sit next to, but at least on this flight it sounds like it'll be flanked by scientists instead of normal jet-setters.\u000aJust a few minutes ago, Athena started the check-in process at LAX, something that was captured and broadcast via the airport's Twitter account. It looks like Athena somehow came by a German passport (or it could simply be a passport for the accompanying scientist):\u000a"Athena" is checking in for her seat aboard @lufthansa on her way to Germany! [PIC]. Have you seen her yet? pic.twitter.com/6pYHiQLC9a\u000a\u2014 LAX Airport (@flyLAXairport) December 15, 2014\u000aAt the end of the day, though, Athena taking up a seat on a commercial airline isn't wildly different than anyone else paying for an extra seat for large, bulky, or fragile cargo \u2014 musicians commonly will pay for a seat for their instruments, for example. Despite that technicality, however, passengers and other airport patrons probably got a kick out of seeing a robot head through the hellish process that is airport security.\u000a

VAcer has two tough new Chromebooks for the classroom | The Verge
p11
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAcer is one of the best Chromebook manufacturers out there, and today it's unveiling two new machines that it wants to see enter the classroom. The Chromebooks are two different sizes \u2014 one has a 15.6-inch display and the other has an 11.6-inch display \u2014 but the standout feature here is what they have in common: both are built to be tough enough to withstand drops and general mishandling. Acer says that both Chromebooks have "reinforced covers" that are able to withstand 60kg of force as well as "reinforced" hinges that are capable of standing up to unusual twisting and stress. The corners are also said to be able to withstand nearly 1.5-foot drops without taking damage.\u000aAcer's biggest Chromebook is a tough one\u000aThese are otherwise fairly standard Chromebooks \u2014 which is to say, they're cheap, powerful enough to browse the web, and just stylish enough to not be considered ugly. Both machines will include one of Intel's Broadwell processors, either a Core i3 or a Celeron. The larger Chromebook, called the C910, will have a 16GB or 32GB SSD and 4GB of RAM, and it'll have the option of either a 1920 x 1080 display or a 1366 x 768 display (naturally, you'll want the former \u2014 but the latter is meant to "meet the budgets of schools"). It'll be available at a base price of $299.99. The smaller Chromebook, the C740, has a 16GB SSD, either 2GB or 4GB of RAM, and will start at $259.99. They'll both be available in February.\u000aAcer's C740 appears to look identical to the C720, seen above.\u000aThough Acer says that the C910 is being newly announced today, it's not clear what, if any, difference there is between it and  the Chromebook 15 that was  announced earlier this month . At most, it looks like some variants of the 15-inch machine are headed for classrooms, while a less-expensive variant of the 15-inch machine will be marketed toward general consumers. That latter model is supposed to go on sale for just $249 \u2014 $50 cheaper than the C910. It's not clear whether the enhanced durability will be exclusive to the education model.\u000aYou may not want to pick up a Chromebook that's specifically meant for the classroom, but you probably won't be disappointed if one of these ends up in yours. Acer has consistently made some of the best Chromebooks around \u2014 we've been fans of its C720 line, in particular \u2014 so there's little reason to doubt that these new ones will be solid options. Acer says that they should have great battery life, too (eight hours for the bigger machine, and nine hours for the smaller one), which should be plenty long for laptops that need to be passed around the classroom.\u000aAcer's C910 appears to be a variant of the Chromebook 15, seen above.\u000a

V10 things we learned at today's Star Wars: The Force Awakens panel | The Verge
p14
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThis morning, J.J. Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy kicked off the annual Star Wars Celebration convention in a very big way. Original cast members Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Anthony Daniels, and Peter Mayhew were all there (Harrison Ford couldn't make it due to his recent plane crash ), as well as new cast members: Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega. And then, of course, there was the trailer \u2014 and the first new look at Han Solo audiences have gotten in 32 years.\u000aWe learned a lot of new information, so we've collected it all here for you. Here's everything we found out about Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u000aThat wasn't Tatooine we saw in the first teaser.\u000aThe first teaser last December featured a sandy planet that many naturally assumed was the series mainstay Tatooine. It turns out, it wasn't: it's a planet called Jakku, and is home to Daisy Ridley's character.\u000aJ.J. Abrams originally said no.\u000aWhile we knew there had been some back and forth before Abrams agreed to direct the project, he explained that when producer Kathleen Kennedy originally approached him, he declined because it didn't fit into the larger plan his family had in place. However, once he started brainstorming what a new Star Wars movie would look like, that changed.\u000aThat new droid BB-8 is real.\u000aThe strange, whirring, soccer ball-meets-R2 unit droid we saw in the teaser? It turns out that thing is actually real. Mark Hamill told this to Yahoo Movies back in December, but seeing is believing. Abrams and the film's team brought out an actual working version of the droid onto stage, as it rolled around, looking back and forth at R2-D2. We don't know how they're pulling it off exactly, but it's full of personality \u2014 and is no doubt going to be a tremendously fun character in the film.\u000aWookies like to get behind the camera, too.\u000aAbrams showed off several behind-the-scenes photos from the making of the film, including him directing a Stormtrooper and a moment with a very familiar-looking furry creature.\u000aThey built several new R2-unit domes for The Force Awakens.\u000aSome of the designers from the new film explained that they created multiple, squared-off domes for new R2 units in the film. They'll be seen in action with X-Wing pilots in the movies. They're known as R0 units \u2014 and one of the crew's personal favorite is R0-LO.\u000aWho is Rey?\u000aDaisy Ridley revealed that her character Rey works as a scavenger at a shipyard on Jakku. That is, until she crosses paths with another character \u2014 and everything changes.\u000aWho is Finn?\u000aJohn Boyega silently conceded that his character was a Stormtrooper \u2014 but what kind of Stormtrooper, or whether he was a "good guy or a bad guy" is still up in the air.\u000aWho is Poe Dameron?\u000aAccording to actor Oscar Isaac, Dameron is "the best pilot in the galaxy" who is "sent on a mission by a princess." This puts him squarely in the Han Solo seat, and according to Isaac, Dameron ends up teaming with Finn. After that, "their fates are forever intertwined."\u000aJohn Boyega was scared to tell his family he was in Star Wars.\u000aThe actor was so superstitious at the prospect of being part of the saga that he was reluctant to tell his parents he was cast until the official cast photo was finally posted online. Even though he was going out on meetings and reading script pages printed on an impossible-to-copy red paper, "I just told them I was filming 24."\u000aThere are more female characters on the way.\u000aThere had been a lot of criticism about the initial Star Wars casting announcements because Daisy Ridley was the only woman \u2014 an issue that affected the original trilogy as well. While several additional actresses have since been cast in The Force Awakens, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy went out of her way to point out that many more female characters would show up in future films. "I wouldn't have had a lot of choices" if she wanted to pick what Star Wars character she would be as a child, Kennedy said. "That's going to change."\u000a

aVA new Deus Ex is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC\u000aDeus Ex: Mankind Divided is a direct sequel to Human Revolution\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aSquare Enix has just revealed Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, the first major release in the cyberpunk action series since 2011's Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The news comes via  a cover reveal for the latest issue of Game Informer .\u000aThe game is set two years after Human Revolution, and will once again star Adam Jensen as the leading character. According to Game Informer, Mankind Divided will feature not only new gameplay twists including new augmentations to play around with, but also a more open-ended structure to give you more freedom to solve challenges. Aside from that, little has been announced so far. The game is coming to the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, though no release date has been announced.\u000aPublisher Square Enix had apparently planned to originally announce the game through a lengthy, elaborate "interactive reveal" \u2014 which included an hours-long Twitch stream of a man pacing in a cell \u2014 but  a leak from a Russian website appears to have spoiled those plans. The campaign had kicked off yesterday, and included a series of cryptic clues, headlined by  the ongoing Twitch stream , where viewers could make choices to influence how a fictional interrogation would play out. All done under the banner #cantkillprogress, the teaser campaign also included  brief videos on Instagram and possibly even  a LinkedIn page .  When the campaign first kicked off , Square Enix said only that the game was the next big release from "one of our Western studios."\u000aWhile this is the first official announcement of the game, we've known a new Deus Ex was in the works for some time. Late last year developer  Eidos Montreal teased what the next entry in the series could look like, when it announced its new game engine called Dawn Engine.\u000a"The Dawn Engine will form the cornerstone for all Deus Ex Universe projects at Eidos Montreal," the studio explained at the time, adding that "Deus Ex Universe is the name we are giving to the fictional world and the rich lore we are creating for it, which will of course include core games, as well as any other projects that will help bring the world of Deus Ex to life."\u000a

V11 things we just learned about how the Apple Watch works | The Verge
p23
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAs of today, developers can now make apps for Apple Watch . Well, they're not separate apps so much as they are extensions of pre-existing iPhone apps, and there isn't a lot of flexibility in the WatchKit toolset \u2014 but it looks like that'll change next year.\u000aUpdate: Read our Apple Watch review .\u000aWe've been combing through all of Apple's publicly-released documentation and watching the WatchKit introduction video. This is everything we've learned about Apple Watch and how it works.\u000aAn iPhone is required \u2014 at (almost) all times. In Apple\u2019s own words, Watch apps extend iOS apps. "You begin your Watch app development with your existing iOS app, which must support iPhone." That\u2019s in part because Watch apps\u2019 processing power is all coming from the iPhone. Apple says that "as the wearer interacts with the Watch App, Apple Watch and iPhone pass information back and forth. Taps and other messages from Apple Watch cause code in your WatchKit Extension [e.g. iPhone] to execute."\u000aAnother key phrase from Apple\u2019s documentation: "A Watch app complements your iOS app; it does not replace it. If you measure interactions with your iOS app in minutes, you can expect interactions with your Watch app to be measured in seconds." The lone exceptions right now are dates, times, and timers, which do not need to call back to your iPhone.\u000aOn the bright side, that means the watches won\u2019t necessarily need constant upgrading \u2014 all you have to do is upgrade your iPhone. Or maybe not\u2026\u000aNative apps are coming next year. Important footnote  from the press release : "Starting later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for Apple Watch." We have no clue if those apps will have similar restrictions or if it\u2019s an entirely different story. But seriously, can we at least get Snake?\u000aThe resolution for Apple Watch\u2019s two "Retina displays." The UI documentation revealed that the smaller, 38mm device will be 272 x 340 pixels and the larger, 42mm one will be 312 x 390 pixels. That comes out to the same aspect ratio (4:5).\u000aThere could be more Watch sizes later. "Unlike iOS, where you place views at a coordinate on the screen," Apple says, "with WatchKit, objects automatically flow downward from the top left corner of the screen, filling the available space." There\u2019s a lot of flexibility with how you group and nest elements in a Watch app, but fundamentally this means apps flow like a responsive website and can fit whatever resolution is available now and in the future. That\u2019ll make things a lot easier for developers and a lot nicer for watch owners should Apple decide to make a change.\u000aThere are two types of Apple Watch notifications. The "Short Look" is only seen briefly when you raise your wrist \u2014 it\u2019s an app icon, an app name, and some brief information. If the wearer keeps their wrist raised long enough \u2014 "after a moment," according to Apple \u2014 the screen changes to a "Long Look" notification, which provides more information and is more customizable. For Long Looks, the app icon and name move to the top of the screen, and wearers can scroll down through the interface to use custom actions (such as "comment" or "favorite") or dismiss the notification.\u000aGlances. We already knew some of this, but now it's well documented. In addition to the app itself and the notification, developers can make "Glances" for quick view of information (e.g. time, weather, tasks left). All the information must fit on a single screen and is read-only, but you\u2019ll be able to tap it to enter the corresponding app.\u000aNo custom gestures. The interface is more or less locked to what Apple wants: vertical swipes scrolls through the screen, horizontal swipes go between pages, taps indicate selection, "force touch" opens up a context menu, and that digital crown scrolls through pages way faster. Additionally an edge swipe left goes back or up a page ("back to the parent interface controller," if we\u2019re being technical), and an edge swipe up opens the "Glance" view.\u000a\u2026 About that "force touch" option. Hard-pressing can open up a simple menu with between one and four possible actions. It looks like AirPlay is supported (which makes sense since the iPhone supports AirPlay and is doing all the work anyway).\u000aMaps are static and non-interactive. The built-in mapping toolkit creates "non-interactive snapshots" with up to five annotations, using either standard red / green / purple pins or custom images. There\u2019s no scrolling around, the map snippet is only as big as the display itself. Tapping on the map will open up the Apple Maps app.\u000aImages are cool. Videos are not. You can cache up to 20MB of image resource in apps, but everything else comes from the WatchKit extension (in other words, from your iPhone). You can "create pre-rendered animations from using a series of static images" with options to loop infinitely or define a specific count\u2026 so basically, GIFs. No support for videos, as best as we can tell \u2014 but you read the resolution, right? Why would you want that?\u000aMeet the new font. We already knew it was happening , but here it is dictating what quick brown foxes do in the presence of lazy dogs. It\u2019s called San Francisco, and it comes highly recommended by Apple.\u000a

V3 ways your wireless service will change under the FCC's net neutrality rules | The Verge
p26
aVOf the many enormous implications that the FCC's Title II reclassification of the internet could have, perhaps none is bigger or more jarring to the telecom industry than the news that  mobile internet will be regulated for the first time with the same level of consumer protection as your wired telephone for the first time .\u000aMake no mistake, the effects of this change are far from theoretical \u2014 there could be very real modifications to your phone service that you'll notice, assuming the rules go through and aren't litigated away  through years of court battles that are inevitably to come . Let's take a look at some of the features and arbitrary limitations your wireless carrier puts on you that could change or go away altogether under a Title II-driven regime.\u000aT-Mobile Music Freedom\u000aT-Mobile launched Music Freedom last year, and  it's been a troubling feature since day one: it exempts streaming music services from data caps. The company \u2014 and in particular firebrand CEO John Legere \u2014 have vigorously defended it by noting that any music service is welcome to participate in the program, but the problem is that it's opt-in at T-Mobile's discretion, not opt-out, and there's nothing stopping T-Mobile from arbitrarily discriminating against certain services.\u000aUnder the FCC's proposed new rules, so-called zero-rating services like Music Freedom wouldn't be outright banned, but they'd be examined on a "case-by-case basis," says a senior FCC official. The official notes that Music Freedom is a "lesser concern" for prohibition because there's no obvious harm to the consumer. Clearly, though, that could change: in order for it to be allowed under Title II, it wouldn't be able to hinder service to any of T-Mobile's customers, which suggests that there would be no way for T-Mobile to ever deny a music service entrance into Music Freedom \u2014 nor would it be able to charge streaming providers for the privilege of being a part of the program.\u000aBandwidth throttling\u000aTitle II regulation would likely put a damper on wireless operators' management of the speeds you get on your device. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler foreshadowed this with a stern letter sent over to Verizon last year, questioning why the carrier was planning to slow down LTE service for unlimited customers under certain circumstances.  Verizon replied that it was a limited move focused on network management and that the maneuver was commonplace in the industry, but the 2010 Open Internet rules \u2014 which would be enforced across wired and wireless internet alike under Title II regulation \u2014 have a fairly hard and fast "no throttling" clause. There is a loophole \u2014 throttling would be disallowed "on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices," which means that customers on capped plans might still be subject to throttling, but targeting specific customers with unlimited plans for using Verizon's fungible definition of "too much" data would almost certainly run afoul of FCC guidelines.\u000aThat said, FCC officials note that "reasonable network management" would still be allowed, saying that they're well aware of the architecture of wireless networks \u2014 perhaps a subtle warning to wireless operators that they can't get one over on the government simply by saying "because LTE" and moving on.\u000aSponsored data\u000aAT&T has been touting so-called  sponsored data for a year now, a troubling system by which individual providers of apps or services can pay AT&T directly to subsidize the data they consume on your device. In other words, deep-pocketed companies have an opportunity to shut out upstarts by giving the data pipe between consumers and their services a huge advantage.\u000aWhen asked whether sponsored data constitutes "paid prioritization" \u2014 a notion unambiguously disallowed under Open Internet rules \u2014 an FCC official's response was very clear: "Yes, it would," he said. As with almost every aspect of the proposed regulation, though, there are plenty of exceptions backstopped by a commission that is keen on taking possible violations on a case-by-case basis. "There may be consumer benefits, there may be significant detriment" depending on the nature of the sponsored data, the official noted. In other words, AT&T's system seems like it won't play under Title II, but there's wiggle room. At least it's consumer benefit that the FCC will have foremost in its mind when analyzing things like this.\u000aVerge Video: Opinion and Analysis on today's huge net neutrality news\u000a
