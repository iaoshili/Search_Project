VA crowdfunded startup explains why crowdfunding can be a complete disaster | The Verge

aVReport\u000aA crowdfunded startup explains why crowdfunding can be a complete disaster\u000aAfter more than two years and two million dollars, Lockitron says it's ready to deliver on its promise\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aLike so many ambitious young hardware startups these days, Lockitron used crowdfunding to sell people a product before they built it. The company promised users a keyless door lock that paired with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC, allowing customers to unlock it remotely or with a simple proximity sensor. Lockitron ran its own crowdfunding campaign and managed to collect more than $2.2 million in pre-orders for around 14,000 units; it aimed to start shipping in March of 2013. The success of that campaign and press attention on the company drove another 70,000 pre-orders through its website.\u000aFast forward to today and Lockitron has shipped just over 11,000 units, less than 14 percent of the orders it had taken over the past two-odd years. And while this early version of the device does work, it can be a struggle to set up, has fallen short on battery life, and is missing prominent features. More than a few customers found themselves locked out after the product malfunctioned. "Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs," says co-founder Cameron Robertson. In a survey sent out to customers, a question asked them to describe Lockitron in three words. "Beta, potential, unreliable," read one response.\u000a"Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs."\u000aIn August of last year the company realized it needed to start from scratch, and today Lockitron is announcing the results. It has a new manufacturing partner and a completely redesigned product,  called Bolt . "We made mistakes, we learned a lot, and now we are ready to deliver something that fulfills our ambition," says Robertson. The new unit is set to start shipping this March for $99, roughly one-third the cost of the original Lockitron.\u000aLockitron's struggles are symptomatic of challenges many young DIY hardware companies face. Crowdfunding, which seemed like the new face of innovation a couple years ago, has been humbled by the complex realities of mass production. The first big hurdle for the company, after the rush of receiving so many orders, was figuring out how to get them all built. "We didn't know the first thing about China, about how to find a good partner \u2014 someone with domain expertise building something like a lock with 41 discreet mechanical components, most of which were custom-made," says Robertson.\u000a"We didn't know the first thing about China."\u000aThe factory they settled on delivered working units, but couldn't keep pace with the promises the company had made around shipping. "We got caught in a low-volume production trap," says Robertson. "We had over 70,000 units on backorder, and they were producing a few hundred each week."\u000aLockitron had come out of the prestigious Y-Combinator startup program , but that certainly didn\u2019t guarantee success \u2014 they were able to build something that worked well for a demo and could endure testing in their lab, but they didn't have the capital to really field test something with the mechanical complexity of a lock. The complexities of testing were magnified by the fact that the product was expected to work in partnership with whatever lock customers already had on their door.\u000aThe Lockitron co-founders with their original hand-built prototype.\u000aLockitron ran  its own crowdfunding campaign , but unlike Kickstarter, they couldn't charge people for orders until they shipped. "We had $2.2 million in orders but none of that capital to work with, so we were super resource-constrained," says Robertson. The company used Amazon to take orders, but Amazon\u2019s policy is not to charge until an item ships. (Kickstarter also uses Amazon, but gets the money earlier by framing its transactions as "donations," not pre-orders.)\u000aHardware products from established companies often get years of testing in the wild, using multiple prototypes, before finally being offered for sale. "Most of what we showed off in the video worked, but under ideal circumstances," says Robertson. "We tested against a fairly big lock library, but nothing like the diversity of old, discontinued, and well-worn locks out in the real world."\u000a"In the real world people have a crappy router."\u000aThe same ideal conditions applied to things like battery testing. "In the real world people have a crappy router several hundred feet away with a few thick walls in between," says Robertson. "The Lockitron would struggle to stay connected, and that ended up being a big drain on battery."\u000aIt was the summer of 2013 when the company started changing course. It found a new manufacturing partner, one that specialized in locks. And it created a new device that replaced customers' existing locks entirely, instead of sitting on top, ensuring if it worked in testing, it would work on your door. Lockitron actually ran a survey of customers who had received the first unit. The overwhelming advice was to trim features and ship something that "just worked."\u000a"They're interested in trying out and helping new companies."\u000aOf the 70,000 people who ordered a Lockitron, about 10,000 have canceled their orders so far. Robertson says that the company has managed to help them keep the faith by being transparent about its struggles and communicating regularly about its progress. "Early on we started updating backers every two weeks like clockwork, and we're past 50 updates now. We send them out via email to all backers as well as post them to [ our blog ]," says Robertson. "They're early adopters, and they're interested in trying out and helping new companies that are working to create new categories of products."\u000aLockitron isn't taking any chances with over-promising this time. "We are telling customers, if you pre-ordered, you can be first in line for the Bolt. But be aware that the first batch will be a sort of pilot, and that after a few months with them in the field, we will produce a version two that addresses any big issues." Customers who backed the Lockitron may have waited a while, but Robertson says they are getting a more robust, functional, and affordable unit. "It\u2019s unfair to ask somebody to wait two to three years," he said. "But hopefully we\u2019re going to deliver them something of lasting value."\u000aVerge Video Archives: HandUp is like Kickstarter for the Homeless (Detours, Season 2)\u000a

VA new experiment tracks credit card data as it travels through the criminal web | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aWhat happens to a credit card number once it leaks onto the web? It's an important question, as data breaches dump more and more personal data onto the web each month, but there's still little understanding of how the information travels once it's outside a company's grasp. As security firms struggle to detect breaches earlier and faster, a new study is shedding light on how far and fast that data might travel in the wake of an intrusion.\u000a"Is there really a liquid market for breach data?"\u000aEarlier this year, security firm  BitGlass decided to test the underground marketplace with  a little experiment . The company created an Excel file with 1,568 fake profiles, complete with names, phone numbers, addresses, social security numbers, and credit card numbers. Along with the phony data, the file had a hidden watermark that would report back to BitGlass every time the file was opened, operating like a homing beacon. Then the company dropped the file onto a public Dropbox account and posted it to a few cybercrime forums and waited for the beacon to phone home.\u000a"We were trying to figure out, is there really a liquid market for breach data?" Bitglass CEO Nat Kausik told The Verge. "If you go out there with a million social security numbers, what do you do with it?" Since Bitglass was already using the watermarking technology in its day-to-day breach prevention business, it was a cheap experiment to undertake \u2014 and, as it turned out, an enlightening one.\u000a1,081 views in 22 countries\u000aThe results were surprising because of both the broad reach of the data and how slowly it traveled. Within the first eight days, the file seems to have stayed confined to the forums where it was posted, chalking up only 200 views in the first eight days after release. Then, suddenly, the file blew up, clearing another 800 views in the next four days. After 12 days, Bitglass's Excel file had been opened at least 1,081 times in 22 different countries.\u000aIn some cases, the patterns even indicated specific groups on the other end. Bitglass picked out two specific groups of related hackers \u2014 one in Russia and one in Nigeria \u2014 which appear as clusters in the data. In each case, the groups appear as disparate IP addresses within the same general region, and all the data points open the file within a few minutes of each other. To Bitglass, it's the footprint of a private chat room and possible evidence of a coordinated criminal enterprise.\u000aBitglass's data isn't perfect. The information in the excel file could have been pulled into a different file, bypassing the company's homing beacon. IP addresses could have been concealed through VPNs or the Tor network \u2014 and knowing the habits of the online criminals, it's likely many of them were. Still, even if the homing beacon data isn't complete, it's a valuable window into the relatively sluggish state of the dark web. If companies were able to detect and respond to the breach within the first week, when only 200 people had seen the data, they could have begun anti-fraud measures before most criminals even knew the data was in the wild.\u000aUnfortunately, most companies' breach response is still measured in months rather than days. News of the Target breach surfaced  24 days after the first credit cards were stolen, while the Home Depot breach went undetected for  almost four months . A similar breach at PF Chang's went undiscovered for 10 months , affecting credit cards used at 33 locations.\u000a

VA single researcher made $225,000 (legally!) by hacking browsers this week | The Verge
p8
aVFor the past two days, security researchers have descended on Vancouver for  a Google-sponsored contest called Pwn2Own , which offers top-dollar prizes for anyone who can publicly exploit bugs in popular browsers and other widely used software like Adobe Flash.\u000aMore than half a million dollars for 21 bugs\u000aThis year was a particularly lucrative one, as a researcher named JungHoon Lee (also known as lokihardt) came away from the contest with a record $225,000 for three bugs, affecting Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Safari. The Chrome bug was the most lucrative, earning $110,000 in total, bringing in extra money because it involved a beta version of Chrome and because Lee was able to exploit the bug into system access. The Chrome bug was revealed in a single two-minute presentation, which, as one observer pointed out, put Lee's earnings at $916 per second.\u000aAt the end of the contest, all vulnerabilities are privately disclosed to vendors in the "Chamber of Disclosures." It's a particularly high-stakes version of a bug bounty program, a system that has become increasingly popular as companies look for legal ways to discover weaknesses before attackers do. This year's contest found 21 bugs in total \u2014 including five bugs in Windows, four bugs in Internet Explorer, and three bugs in Firefox \u2014 and paid a total of $557,500 to participating researchers.\u000a

VA new breed of startups is helping hackers make millions \u2014 legally | The Verge

aVA new breed of startups is helping hackers make millions \u2014 legally\u000aThe bug bounty business is booming\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aShashank Kumar was in seventh grade when he was introduced to computer hacking. At first he had fun breaking in and defacing web sites, something he says he now regrets, but then he learned that he can get paid for reporting the weaknesses he was exploiting. Under the handle  @cyberboyIndia, he says he has earned around $30,000 in so called bug bounties, enough to pay for a good portion of his college education.\u000aThese days the 19-year-old is supposed to be cramming for his final exams as he prepares for a degree in engineering. But many nights he finds himself awake too late, laptop humming away, hunting for software vulnerabilities on services run by firms like Yahoo, Paypal, and AT&T. On Twitter, Shashank catalogs the rewards he receives for reporting weaknesses, a highlight reel that ranges from a free hat, to a new smartphone, to a $1,500 check. The money is good, although it\u2019s murder on his grades.\u000aopened laptop for 5 min. found something suspicious.Bug in Google spotted . ended up using laptop for 5 hours :/. thats why i fail in xam :|\u000a\u2014 Shashank (@cyberboyIndia) December 26, 2013\u000aShashank is part of a broader trend sweeping the security industry. Last week, Google announced that it was  changing the rules on its bug bounty program, Pwnium . Instead of a respectable $2.7million awarded once a year, the contest will now run year round, with a total prize pool of "\u221e million*." In other words the money never has to stop flowing, although Google\u2019s clever asterisk placement reserves the right to cancel at any time.\u000aGoogle upped its reward pool to infinity\u000aBut that\u2019s not likely to happen, at least if Google wants to stay competitive. Bug bounty programs used to work with informal rewards: a thank you letter, an online shoutout, a free t-shirt, or perhaps a few hundred dollars. But over the last five years, they have become a bonanza. Almost every major tech company has one running, and they have steadily increased the size and volume of rewards.\u000aMost importantly, a new breed of startups like Crowdcurity, Bugcrowd, Synack, and HackerOne have made it possible for any company to launch its own bug bounty, dramatically expanding the size of the market. Instead of being something only large technology companies do, bug bounties are now proliferating across all industries and for companies big and small, allowing these startups to pay out millions in rewards over the past two years.\u000aA new weapon in the endless war\u000a"It\u2019s changed the way we think about security," says Andrew Pile, the chief technology officer at Vimeo, which recently launched a bug bounty through HackerOne. "It would have been nearly impossible for us to build this kind of program in-house from scratch."\u000a"It changed the way we think about security."\u000aAs Vimeo grew in size over the years, it would receive occasional submissions about security flaws in its system, but Pile never felt comfortable paying for them. "The only way we could thank them was a free account or t-shirt, which didn\u2019t really encourage the best people to come back."\u000aLike most companies, Vimeo had a chicken and egg problem. Building up critical mass of trusted researchers required shelling out big bucks. But it was loath to open up its checkbook for people it didn\u2019t know and trust, especially a disparate and sometimes anonymous mob of teenage hackers.\u000aBug bounty startups essentially act as market makers, creating trust and liquidity so that smaller companies like Vimeo can tap into the supply of global hackers. "Paying people can be a real pain; they are all over the world, and they don\u2019t have W-9s," says Pile. HackerOne handles the legal and logistical nightmare, taking care of billing and payment in exchange for a 20 percent commission on top of each bounty.\u000aThe system is working so well that companies, which are large enough to handle their own programs, like Yahoo and Twitter, have chosen to use third-party vendors like HackerOne instead. "The band-aid approach of throwing more and more hardware and software at the problem clearly is not working. We need an orthogonal approach, and one that is proven," says Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist and investor in HackerOne. "Bug bounty programs get in front of the problem instead of just playing defense."\u000aDown with the dupes\u000aFor the bug hunters, the biggest risk is that they will invest hours in finding a flaw and writing a report that explains how it works and can be fixed, only to learn that it\u2019s already been submitted by a rival. Shashank and his friends have crafted playful memes about the heartbreak of "duplicates," as they are known in the business.\u000a"There is a huge amount of trust involved," says Vimeo\u2019s Pile. "They spend a ton of time identifying and documenting these issues, and then the report goes into a black box. I closed out a significant number that were duplicates, and unfortunately we can only pay on a first come first serve basis."\u000a"Bug bounty like online poker, I think."\u000aInterestingly, none of the half dozen researchers from bug bounty leader boards contacted by The Verge were doing this work full time. The haphazard nature made monthly earnings uneven. All referred to it as a passion, a hobby, or a part-time gig, although many said the pay was quite good when they happened to strike first. "Bug bounty like online poker I think [sic]," wrote a Russian hacker, Andrew. "You may be in luck and got a big prize [but] may be not in luck and during long time nothing to find [sic]." In a way, the robust market of researchers may be as much about outsourcing as crowdsourcing. There is a wealth of teenage talent in places like India and Pakistan willing to hunt bugs despite the risk of time wasted.\u000aDupes or low-value reports can also be a problem for the companies entering this market. "The downside of saying 'if you give us vulnerability we will give you money' is you get a lot of garbage reports," says Daniel LeCheminant, who recently launched Trello\u2019s bounty program. "In the first week and a half we have gotten 200 submissions and maybe 10 were actionable."\u000aFormer NSA operatives are getting into the bug business\u000aBecause of this inefficiency, Synack uses a much less open model. It\u2019s the best funded of the bug bounty startups, and it was founded by veterans of the NSA who spent years looking for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the government. "We are taking a different approach from these other managed bug bounty providers," says founder Jay Kaplan. "The number of people out there in developing countries eager to make even $50 can create a lot of noise." The companies that use Synack don\u2019t pay hackers, but instead pay a flat fee for the service. Synack uses a limited pool of hackers who have passed its three-tiered test, vets all the submissions, and assigns the bounties, insulating its more conservative, largely non-tech clients from the chaos.\u000aAvoiding Blowback\u000aAlex Rice, the former head of Facebook security and now CTO of HackerOne, says that most hackers will choose an official program over the black market, even if the prices are not as high. "To sell something on the black market, you have to weaponize it. That can take months. And so you have to empower the majority. They have the software skills but not the malicious intent."\u000aBut some industry experts warn that if not handled properly, this dynamic can have repercussions for the companies running the bounty programs. "The problem is companies think that bug bounties are simply something they can announce and that will be enough," Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of the security firm High-Tech Bridge,  said on his company blog . He used the example of a hacker who reports a duplicate that has not yet been patched. "Okay, if you\u2019re not interested in what we\u2019ve discovered, we\u2019ll swap our white hat for a grey / black hat and talk to someone else who may well pay us more."\u000a""When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time."\u000aGus Anagnos helped launch the bug bounty programs at Paypal and now works at Synack. "What doesn\u2019t get talked about much," he says, is the blowback from hackers who felt they didn\u2019t get enough money or that their bugs weren\u2019t disclosed in a reasonable amount of time. These hackers would often go public, creating a PR nightmare for the company involved. That leads to companies overreacting to every submission. "When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time on vulnerabilities that aren\u2019t very important," says Anagnos.\u000aThe startups who run these marketplaces have ameliorated the duplicate problem in part by awarding points that build a hacker\u2019s reputation. "They give points for your duplicate bugs," Shashank told The Verge by email. Those points add up to invitations for private bounty hunts where rewards are more plentiful and competition is less crowded. "So here we get the fruit of our duplicate bugs," Shashank says. He currently sits on the leaderboards for Bugcrowd and Crowdcurity, which highlight the top researchers of each month and all time.\u000aThese private bug hunts have benefits for both sides. "Large tech companies are comfortable with the chaos of inviting people to try and pick apart your system in public," says Casey Ellis, the CEO of Bugcrowd. "A bank, a big box retailer, they aren\u2019t built like that, they don\u2019t have the same appetite for risk." Startups that offer this service typically start companies with a private program open only to a select group of trusted hackers. Slowly, as the companies learn the ropes, that can be expanded to a more public test, or the launch of an official bounty program on the client\u2019s own website.\u000aMaking the best of a bad situation\u000aSome security professionals who were critical of the proliferation in bug bounties a few years ago have since changed their tune. "I was afraid companies would start these programs and people would put up terrible bugs and demand money for them, and companies would waste time on them while real security vulnerabilities didn\u2019t get fixed," says Dan Kaminsky. "But I\u2019m pleasantly surprised with how well they have worked in the field. There is a serious talent crunch, and programs like this help to maximize a company\u2019s ability to tap all the expertise out there."\u000a"The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."\u000aStill, the programs have plenty of skeptics who feel bug hunting is largely housekeeping that doesn't address systemic security risks. "There is a huge culture around finding the bugs so that we can patch them," says Peter Herzog, a security analyst and creator of OSSTMM. "It has more of a basis in marketing than reality. The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."\u000aHerzog points out that high-profile hacks like Sony Pictures likely originated with an employee who was compromised, not a technical flaw. "Most of the attacks that happened were done through social engineering. How are we going to start patching the people?" asks Herzog. "What\u2019s the point of looking for bugs when people are the ones downloading and installing the malware."\u000aEven the founders of these startups are quick to admit that bug bounties are no magic bullet for security woes. "It\u2019s not like you run a bug bounty program and now everything is secure," says Jacob Hansen, Crowdcurity\u2019s co-founder and CEO. "It\u2019s one item in the toolbox. You need code reviews, physical security, and employee training."\u000aBut studies of the Chrome and Firefox bounty programs have found they are cheaper than hiring full-time security researchers. "Organizations are coming to realize that the tools of the past don\u2019t scale to the way they develop applications today," says Synack\u2019s Kaplan. "Companies are pushing out code 10 times a day. To keep up with hackers you can\u2019t rely on automated approaches or occasional consultants. You need a big group with a diverse set of skills constantly probing your system for weakness."\u000a

VA woman looks for the buried loot of Fargo in Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter | The Verge

aVA woman looks for the buried loot of Fargo in Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter\u000aWithout a choice, a woman searches for a better life\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aUnsettling ideas about motherhood and pop culture obsession lurk just beneath the surface of Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, a new, ambitiously strange drama by independent filmmaking duo David and Nathan Zellner. The titular adventurer \u2014 a Tokyo office worker with grand aspirations \u2014 believes a mysterious VHS copy of Fargo will lead her to the treasure buried beneath the snow in the film's conclusion.\u000aThe film, which premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival and is now screening in select theaters, is inspired by the urban legend of Takako Kanishi, a woman from Tokyo who was found dead outside Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. The story goes that Kanishi was in search of the Fargo treasure, but an investigation revealed Kanishi had lost her job and revisited an area she'd shared with a former lover. In a field, she committed suicide with a cocktail of alcohol and sedatives. Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter is fascinated with the line between fact and fiction, the real world and the film world. The film appropriately contorts itself, telling the fictional story of a real life event that itself was fictionalized to incorporate the treasure of a fictional story that claimed to be real.\u000aThe premise is enticing, but Kumiko's adventure progresses slowly and meticulously, like a series of beautiful, glossy photographs tacked into a scrapbook. Shots are constructed with such care and purpose that it\u2019s tempting to read each with the precision Kumiko devotes to cross-stitching her treasure maps.\u000aThe film is fillled with mysterious symbols and clues; Kumiko wears red throughout the film, and red scarves hang from the necks of the few people who show her affection. And so, Kumiko\u2019s life is one in pursuit of an escape. Scenes often begin and end with characters in profile, or the camera locked onto Kumiko's head in the center of the frame, almost as if it's physically harnessed to her. The score sounds like the original Fargo soundtrack, but gradually digitized and distorted, as if the audio has been gnawed by a busted cassette player. Like Kumiko\u2019s adventure itself, it\u2019s not immediately clear where any of these individual stylistic choices will lead.\u000aThe Tokyo that Kumiko leaves behind is a place void of freedom. The places she frequents \u2014 the subway, the library, the office \u2014 are constructed in claustrophobic corridors. Caught between library stacks or dark hallways, the current of the city pulls her from one destination to the next. When Kumiko rests, she\u2019s often obscured behind a doorframe or a window; or the film shows her in harsh profile, pinning her to the wall, like a butterfly in a shadowbox.\u000aEarly in the film, when Kumiko first decides to leave Tokyo for Fargo World, we see the city from her point of view. Inside of a library\u2019s elevator, we watch layers of humans pass by as she descends. From that point forward, her life is dominated by a series of different captors, people who want to remake her in their own image. Her boss wants her to be a servant; evangelists assume she's a Christian; a stranger adopts her; her mother misses the child that grew up. These authority figures are as restrictive as her environment, but their presence lends structure to both the film and its protagonist.\u000awomen in this film are defined entirely by their ability to be mothers\u000aKumiko is at a crossroads in her life: she must decide whether to get married and have children, or to return home under the watchful eye of her mother, who haunts Kumiko through her cellphone. For the most part, women in this film are defined entirely by their ability to be mothers. We see the life-fulfilling happiness of motherhood through Kumiko\u2019s only friend, and the loneliness through the empty nest of an unexpected ally.\u000aAt times, the film portrays Kumiko as mentally ill, or perhaps an extreme version of the kind of film fanatic who obsesses over a single text. (Her preoccupation with Fargo, her inability to distinguish fact from fiction, her need to find meaning in a single scene of a popular movie, certainly plays as a metaphor for often myopic art of certain kinds of film criticism.) But the film feels much more like a howl against patriarchy and the expectations of motherhood on young women. It\u2019s too painful to think that Kumiko, who so desperately wants adventure, to find the unknown, to find somewhere she belongs, is doing so because of some mental imbalance or pop culture preoccupation. Is it truly crazy to wish to live one\u2019s life for one\u2019s self?\u000aIt's too painful to think that Kumiko is just crazy\u000aAt the end of the film Kumiko rides a ski lift upward, high into a featureless snow. In the deep winter, there are no lines, or signs, or people to make demands of her. There\u2019s emptiness, and the sense that true freedom might be free of everyone else \u2014 especially Mom and her unrelenting expectations.\u000a

aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aOn June 30th at precisely 23:59:59, the world\u2019s atomic clocks will pause for a single second. Or, to be more precise, they\u2019ll change to the uncharted time of 23:59:60 \u2014 before ticking over to the more worldly hour of 00:00:00 on the morning of July 1st, 2015. This addition of a leap second,  announced by the Paris Observatory this week , is being added to keep terrestrial clocks in step with the vagaries of astronomical time \u2014 in this case, the slowing of the Earth\u2019s rotation. And it's a bit of a headache for computer engineers.\u000aWhat causes leap seconds? Earthquakes, tidal drag, the weather\u000aLeap seconds are like the Y2K bug in that they threaten to throw out of sync time as measured by computers and time as measured by atomic clocks. But while Y2K was a single instance (computer systems that were used to abbreviating the year to two digits were confused by "2000" and "1900"), the addition of leap seconds are a regular problem. The first was added back in 1972; this year\u2019s will be the 26th, and they're  not likely to stop coming . They're also broadly unpredictable: earthquakes, tidal drag, and the weather all affect the rotation of the Earth, and it\u2019s up to the scientists at the  International Earth Rotation Service to keep an eye on things and call the changes as they come.\u000aUnfortunately, when the last leap second was added back in 2012, more than a few sites had trouble keeping pace. As reported by  Phys.org, Foursquare, Reddit, LinkedIn, and StumbledUpon all crashed when the leap second ticked unexpectedly into place. In the case of Reddit, the problem was  eventually traced back to a Linux subsystem that got confused when it checked the Network Time Protocol only to find an extra second.  Speaking to Wired about the problem back in 2012, Linux creator Linus Torvalds commented: "Almost every time we have a leap second, we find something. It\u2019s really annoying, because it\u2019s a classic case of code that is basically never run, and thus not tested by users under their normal conditions."\u000aGoogle solves the problem of the extra second by cutting it into milliseconds\u000aInstead, companies have been forced to create their own workaround, with Google\u2019s "leap smear" perhaps the best-known example. As the company\u2019s site reliability engineer Christopher Pascoe  explained in a blog post , the usual fix is to turn back the clocks by one second at the end of the day, essentially playing that second again. However, says Pascoe, this creates problems: "What happens to write operations that happen during that second? Does email that comes in during that second get stored correctly?" Google\u2019s solution is to cut the extra second into milliseconds and then sprinkle these tiny portions of time into the system imperceptibly throughout the day. "This [means] that when it became time to add an extra second at midnight," says Pascoe, "our clocks [have] already taken this into account, by skewing the time over the course of the day."\u000aCould we detach our concept of time from the solar day?\u000aOf course, not every website or company has the sort of engineering resources needed to implement something like a "leap smear," and when June 30th rolls around in the summer, you can expect to see the odd outage or two. Beyond clever engineering though, there's not much to be done. As  The Telegraph reports , there are some factions in the US that would like to drop the leap second altogether, but doing so would mean unmooring our concept of time from one of the most fundamental timescales, the solar day, and setting civil time on a path forever  diverging from time as measured by our planet . Would it be worth the trouble? We'll get another chance to find out on June 30th.\u000a

V13 products from last year's Consumer Electronics Show that went nowhere | The Verge

aV13 products from last year's Consumer Electronics Show that went nowhere\u000aEnter the world of vapor\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe Consumer Electronics Show is an entire week dedicated to the not-too-distant future. Companies are taking the covers off remarkable feats of technology that they\u2019ve been working on for months or years with the promise that you\u2019ll actually be able to buy them at some point in the course of the year.\u000aBut it\u2019s hard to predict the future. A lot can change in the span of 12 months, not just for a company, but for an entire product category. Things that once showed promise are often killed off before they even hit store shelves. Something can be on track, but a part isn\u2019t quite right, or a better idea springs along mid-development. Other times, companies simply realize they\u2019ve bitten off more than they can chew and decide to kill off a project mid-run.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThis past year\u2019s show is no exception to that rule. 3,200 exhibitors showed off their wares. Not all of what they presented was new, of course, but many showed off products, services, and ideas with the promise we\u2019d be seeing them in stores in time for a holiday season that\u2019s come and gone. We\u2019ve gone back through the list from last January to check in on some of the most interesting things that were destined to arrive, but never did.\u000aAsus Transformer Book Duet\u000aWhy pick an operating system for a tablet when you could run two instead? And why have just a laptop or a tablet, and not both at the same time? Asus\u2019 Transformer Book Duet answered both these questions with a design that would let you swap between Android and Windows, and back and forth between a tablet and a computer. Everything looked on track for the device, until it was cancelled following reported pressure from Google and Microsoft .\u000aVapor Corp. biometric vaporizer\u000aThe unfortunately named Vapor Corp. is the maker of real vaping products, but one of them disappeared in a cloud of its own vapor. The company\u2019s biometric vaporizer promised an additional measure of safety for those who like to leave their vape pens laying around the house. A biometric sensor wouldn\u2019t activate the device unless you were the one using it, making it safer around children. The company says it\u2019s still developing the technology, and plans to have a working prototype in a few weeks\u2019 time.\u000aVerge Video Archives: This Is What Vape Hacking Looks Like\u000aRazer Project Christine\u000aRazer\u2019s Project Christine is a plug-and-play computer with components that could be slotted into a rack like video game cartridges. Want a fast CPU? Just plug it into the rack; no screwdrivers or know-how required. Razer pitched this as a concept and not a product that was ready to go, but the company\u2019s aim was to bring it to market sometime in 2014. Instead, Razer reportedly had issues finding any companies that wanted to actually manufacture it. Not that we should count Razer out, though: the company made some pretty drastic changes to its handheld gaming system, the Edge , in the year between its introduction at CES in 2012 and its commercial release a year later.\u000aArchos smartwatches\u000aArchos introduced a trio of Pebble-like smartwatches at CES, with a launch planned sometime in summer. One included a black-and-white screen, another with a color touchscreen, and a third \u2014 the most interesting of the bunch \u2014 with an E Ink touchscreen. All aimed to beam smartphone notifications and simple apps onto the wrist. Archos\u2019 timing was bad, though, with Google\u2019s Android Wear debuting just two months later .\u000aScanadu Scout\u000aScanadu\u2019s Scout promised what was basically a medical tricorder from Star Trek, a small device that was able to scan your vitals and send that information over to your smartphone over Bluetooth. To be completely fair, the project was launched in late 2012, and went on to break Indiegogo\u2019s crowdfunding records. But the first prototype of the device was shown off at CES a year ago. The company originally planned to give backers an early version in March, but that was delayed after issues with both the hardware and software algorithms. Now the company\u2019s goal is to deliver more than 8,000 of the devices to campaign backers sometime this month.\u000aBliq light\u000aDo you remember when Phillips made a splash with its Hue bulbs in 2012? This past January came Bliq , a decorative light that would also let you change its colors with your phone, or pop with a different color if you got a notification. The big difference is that Hue could go in standard sockets and be used just like any other light, whereas Bliq was meant to be something for your coffee table, or bookshelf. It ended up on neither.\u000aTrewgrip keyboard\u000aThis very unusual keyboard debuted at CES , and is half-phone dock, half-keyboard. You type on keys that are on the back of the slab, which is where your fingers would naturally be. The whole thing is curved, kind of like an archery bow, and requires memorizing where those keys are on the back. The company says the learning curve for using it was somewhere between 8-10 hours. The keyboard was originally set to be available available in the second half of this year, but is now being pre-sold with a promised "spring 2015" availability.\u000aCanopy Sensus case\u000aCanopy, a small company based out of Minneapolis, designed the Sensus case so that you could touch the back of your phone, as well as the front. It actually debuted the idea at CES in 2013, but came back at last year\u2019s show with another pre-production version that could measure different levels of force and that supported newer iPhone models. The company ceased development on the case in June.\u000aLifelogger camera\u000aLifelogger\u2019s camera system pitched itself as "the ultimate life logging system," one that was capable of storing moments it recorded with a Google Glass-like camera, and making them easily accessible. Think Evernote , but for your eyeballs. In a notice in August, the company said that developing the camera has become "a big challenge since we are making it extremely small while still offering all the options," and that it\u2019s also focusing on making a platform for other camera makers to use its software. Its latest dispatch said the goal was to get the hardware into production sometime in the next few months, but also that it\u2019s showing off yet another prototype at this year\u2019s show.\u000aGlassup headset\u000aThis Google Glass-like gadget was unveiled in prototype form back in January, with the intention of launching this summer for a very palatable $399 (Google\u2019s beta version of Glass costs more than three times that). Unlike Glass, GlassUp displayed heads up information on a lens right in front of you, instead of off to the side. A failed Indiegogo campaign put a damper on that, suggesting there was a relatively low interest in the product. The latest message from the company was back in August , with a Glassup team member saying it had been a challenge to find the right materials and components, but that it had identified suppliers to make the headwear, and was still looking for a distributor.\u000aFinsix Dart charger\u000aFinsix's Dart promised to upend the world of notebook chargers with something that was four times smaller than most wall adapters, and six times lighter. Those were big claims, and enough to help the company raise more than $500,000 in crowdfunding. Unfortunately, the company kept those backers in the dark for most of the year, and has pushed ship dates for those early buyers back into this June.\u000aGeonaute 360 camera\u000aThe Geonaute 360 camera is like a GoPro, but records what\u2019s happening in three other directions, at once. You can register to buy it, but there\u2019s no estimate for when that is. Its demo last year was impressive though, offering a tantalizing vision of what video could look like inside of VR headsets.\u000aTwelve24 E ink clock\u000aE ink is cool on E readers, watches, and smartphones, but what about on a giant $499 wall clock? That\u2019s the goal of the Twelve24 E Ink clock , which could run a full year on just a watch battery, and was set to launch sometime last year. Now you can sign up to find out when you can preorder it.\u000aVerge Video Archives: Farewell CES 2014 (Supercut)\u000a

VA new hack could let thieves bypass the iPhone's lockscreen | The Verge
p35
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aResearchers at the security firm MDSec have found a way to bypass the iPhone's lockscreen using just a few hundred dollars in equipment. The lockscreen typically bricks a phone after 10 bad guesses and has proven difficult to bypass on non-jailbroken phones, but MDSec has found a way to power off the phone before it registers an incorrect guess, allowing effectively unlimited guesses. Apple seems to have updated to  protect against the bug in iOS 8.1.1 , but any iPhones running 8.1 or earlier will still be affected.\u000aMDSec's system works by watching for tiny changes in the iPhone screen, indicating a wrong-password notification a fraction of a second before the phone tallies a wrong guess. Once the system sees the screen change, it cuts off power, shutting down the phone before the wrong guess is counted. Done right, it allows attackers to cycle through all 10,000 possible passcodes without locking the phone, effectively bypassing the iPhone's first line of security.\u000aIt requires a lot of skill to pull that off, particularly in securing the power supply. Turning the device off that quickly means cracking open the device and physically disconnecting the battery to put everything on USB power. The shutdown process also means every guess takes roughly 40 seconds, so cycling through all 10,000 would take the better part of a week, which would give users ample time to trigger the phone's shutdown feature. Still, it's plausible thieves might try the approach as a way to bypass the lockscreen, simply because of the substantial payoff when the system is successful.\u000aMore broadly, it's a sign of how exacting security research can be. The only vulnerability here is in the order of processes, displaying that a passcode has failed a few steps before the internal system adds the wrong guess to its running tally. That split second pause was enough to give MDSec an opening, leading to an exceptionally elaborate way to bypass the lockscreen.\u000a
