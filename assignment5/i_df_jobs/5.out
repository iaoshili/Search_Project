VAaron Sorkin says Steve Jobs' daughter Lisa is the hero of his film | The Verge

aVAaron Sorkin says Steve Jobs' daughter Lisa is the hero of his film\u000aReal-life Lisa didn't participate in Isaacson's bio but spoke with Sorkin about the script\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aWe still don't know who is going to play the titular character in Aaron Sorkin / Danny Boyle's upcoming Steve Jobs film \u2014  Christian Bale recently dropped out , and the currently-rumored frontrunner is Michael Fassbender. In an  interview with The Independent , Sorkin says a casting announcement is imminent, but more interestingly, Sorkin also provides a new take on the focus on his Jobs film (which, he stresses, is not a "biopic"), including a larger role for Jobs' daughter, Lisa:\u000a"With The Social Network, I was interested in the psychology of the world's most successful social networking system being invented by the world's most anti-social guy. And in the case of Steve Jobs, it's the relationships he had \u2014 particularly with his daughter, Lisa \u2014 that drew me to it," he says. Jobs initially denied paternity of his daughter, now 36, though they later reconnected and she lived with him in her teens. "She didn't participate in Walter Isaacson's book, because her father was alive at the time, and she didn't want to alienate either of her parents, so I was very grateful that she was willing to spend time with me," says Sorkin. "She is the heroine of the movie."\u000aThe 181-page script is still reportedly a three-act story "set backstage before three of Jobs' major product launches spanning 16 years" (it's a little more than 16 years, but our guess would be 1983's Macintosh debut, 1988's NeXT Introduction, and 2001's iPod reveal,  which Sorkin himself revealed in 2012 ).\u000aIf that's still the case, how Lisa will be incorporated \u2014 how she will find herself backstage \u2014 will be interesting, to say the least. In the same interview, Sorkin addresses Facebook founder  Mark Zuckerberg's thoughts on his portrayal in The Social Network : "People don't live their lives in the same narrative structure as a movie; our lives don't play out in a series of scenes; people don't speak in dialogue \u2014 so that was made up."\u000aAccording to THR , the role of Jobs' daughter is still being cast, with actresses reading lines from The Newsroom's second season in order to keep the biopic script a secret. The studio has reportedly courted Jessica Chastain for an unspecified role .\u000a

VA renegade sculptor has mounted a bust of Edward Snowden in a Brooklyn park | The Verge
p8
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aToday, a renegade sculptor mounted a bust of Edward Snowden in a popular Brooklyn park. The bust was placed before dawn this morning near the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park, atop a preexisting plinth at the southeast corner. Parks Department officials were unable to remove the bust initially, but arrived at noon to cover it with a tarpaulin. A little over an hour later, the bust was fully removed.\u000aAccording to the artist, the sculpture was meant to honor Snowden as a modern-day martyr akin to those honored by the monument. The sculpture was cast from a bronzelike substance, meant to mimic the style and feel of the bronze sculptures already in the park. The bust was also sized to fit perfectly on the plinths already in place at the park. "We look at this as a gift to the city," the anonymous sculptor told Animal New York , "but gifts are sometimes not accepted."\u000aParkgoers and members of the media approach the bust for photos.\u000aWhen The Verge arrived at the park shortly after 11:30AM, the name at the base of the plinth had already been removed by park rangers, but were still assessing how to remove the bust itself. A nearby Parks worker declined to say when the department might come to remove the bust. "We're trying to avoid a whole bunch of media," he said, "even though I know they're on their way." The effort was unsuccessful, as a Vine employee captured the covering of the statue later that day.\u000a2:14pm ET: The bust has been fully removed; we've updated the piece accordingly.\u000aEdward Snowden has been removed. pic.twitter.com/2DYqBElN4L\u000a

VA ninja cat riding a fire-breathing unicorn is exactly why Microsoft is cool again | The Verge
p11
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aMicrosoft\u2019s Windows team likes ninja cats and fire-breathing unicorns if this laptop sticker is anything to go by. I first heard about the existence of this laptop sticker shortly before the first Windows 10 event in September, and I\u2019ve been trying to track it down ever since. The stickers magically appeared on Microsoft's campus, and Windows team members have snapped them up and some use them on their laptops. It\u2019s the perfect example of a company with a bit of personality, and something you rarely see from a corporate giant like Microsoft. The software maker even has a Windows t-shirt it's handing out at Mobile World Congress this week that mocks the lack of Windows 9 (see below).\u000aExcel keyboards on Android are cool, and  great iOS email apps or crazy  HoloLens headsets are even cooler, but this laptop sticker is the definition of cool. I mean, just look at it. It\u2019s a ninja cat riding a fire-breathing unicorn, all while waving a Windows flag.  It might be lacking a rainbow, lasers shooting from the unicorn\u2019s eyes, and nyan cat running away from a Minecraft world, but it\u2019s still cool. It\u2019s official, Microsoft really is cool again.\u000aSaw this Windows t-shirt at the Microsoft booth today. Check out Windows 9 pic.twitter.com/H4jmi8hPfa\u000a

V10 things to expect at Mobile World Congress | The Verge

aV10 things to expect at Mobile World Congress\u000aThere will be phones\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aEvery year, tens of thousands of reporters, analysts, and suited-up businesspeople descend upon Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress trade show. Mobile World Congress, or MWC if you're in the know, is the largest trade show for mobile technology: phones, networks, hotspots, infrastructure, and more phones.\u000aIn recent years, MWC has been fairly sleepy, shifting from a consumer-centric show with big product launches to a more business-focused one that catered to infrastructure announcements. But this year it appears the show will swing back in the other direction: there are lots of companies that will be at MWC this year, and some major product announcements are expected to drop.\u000aThe fun starts on Sunday, and we'll be there covering it on the ground with hands-on reports, live blogs, video, and more. All of our coverage will be neatly organized in our special MWC 2015 hub (bookmark it!). But to whet your appetite for now, here are nine things plus one wildcard we expect to see at this year's MWC.\u000aExpect phones. Lots and lots of phones.\u000aSamsung will have two new phones\u000aLike last year, Samsung is hosting a big press event on Sunday. Also like last year, Samsung\u2019s announcements have largely leaked: it appears that the company will possibly announce two phones , one being the Galaxy S6 and the other being an Edge version with curved sides. There\u2019s still a chance that Samsung has a surprise or two in store, so we\u2019ll be there at Samsung\u2019s Unpacked event to report it all.\u000aHTC will have one new phone\u000aHTC is also hosting a press event on Sunday, where it\u2019s expected to announce the One M9, the successor to last year\u2019s M8. In fact, the M9 is all but guaranteed to be announced, and it seems that virtually everything about the phone has already leaked , so we\u2019ll have to see if the company has anything else up its sleeve for its press event. Perhaps it will pull out something related to its recent partnership with fitness clothing company Under Armour ?\u000aMozilla will advance Firefox OS, a little\u000aMozilla often uses MWC to showcase new advancements in its Firefox OS platform, and sure enough, the company is hosting an event on Sunday to do just that. It\u2019s not yet clear exactly what we\u2019ll see there, but since Firefox is firmly positioned for entry-level markets, we don\u2019t expect fireworks.\u000aLG will show off a watch\u000aLG doesn\u2019t have nearly the presence of HTC or Samsung this year, and it just launched the G Flex 2 at CES in January. We\u2019re not expecting much in the way of flagship devices, but LG has already announced updates to its mid-range phones. Oh, and maybe we\u2019ll get a better look at LG\u2019s Urbane LTE webOS (or is it?) smartwatch.\u000aMicrosoft may give us a closer look at Windows 10 on phones\u000aMicrosoft is hosting a press event on Monday morning where it will surely announce some new products. This is the first Mobile World Congress since Microsoft closed its acquisition of Nokia\u2019s phone business, but we\u2019re not expecting anything huge in terms of new hardware. Sources tell us that Microsoft will announce two mid-range Windows Phone handsets, a 5-inch Lumia 640, and a larger Lumia 1330. Chances are the only new Windows Phone devices we\u2019ll see at MWC will be from Microsoft itself. But Microsoft is likely saving its higher-end phones for later this year when Windows 10 drops.\u000aGoogle will give a keynote speech\u000aGoogle doesn\u2019t often make big announcements at trade shows, and it\u2019s not done much of anything at MWC in year\u2019s past. But this year, head of product Sundar Pichai is giving a 45-minute talk on Monday, and he could very well use that to announce some new products or initiatives.\u000aSony will show off a tablet\u000aSony usually uses CES for its big phone unveils, but it looks like the company will trot out a new Z4 tablet at this year's MWC. An early leak of the device shows a typical Sony design with an ultra-thin profile. Sony is also likely to announce new mid-range and low-end smartphones, but we\u2019re not expecting a Z4 flagship phone at this show.\u000aMotorola will show its low-end chops\u000aMotorola just this week announced its second-generation Moto E , a welcome update to one of the best entry-level phones you can buy. Given that, we don\u2019t expect the company to do much at MWC, and a press event is not planned.\u000aBlackBerry will talk about future devices\u000aIn the past few months, BlackBerry finally started refreshing its device lineup, with the launch of the Passport and Classic before the end of 2014. CEO John Chen said at CES that it would be providing guidance on its future device plans at MWC, and the company has scheduled a press event for Tuesday where he\u2019ll likely do just that. Rumors have said that despite committing itself back to hardware keyboards, BlackBerry is working on a new all-touchscreen device that it may show off next week.\u000aValve may surprise us with VR\u000aValve is a bit of a dark horse here. As a gaming company, it\u2019s not usually associated with Mobile World Congress. But Valve will be at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, which runs concurrent to MWC, to show off new head-mounted virtual reality gear. That begs the question, what phone companies might Valve partner with for this head-mounted VR platform? It\u2019s a long shot, but perhaps we\u2019ll find out at MWC.\u000aLearn more\u000a

VAmazon and Hachette have finally resolved their bitter dispute | The Verge
p17
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAfter a months-long public battle, Amazon and book publisher Hachette have patched things up and signed a new, multiyear agreement. Specific terms of their new deal aren't being disclosed, but Hachette claims it's got full control over ebook pricing. "This approach, known as the Agency model, protects the value of our authors\u2019 content, while allowing the publisher to change ebook prices dynamically to maximize sales," CEO Michael Pietsch told Hachette authors by email. (CNN reporter Brian Stelter has  posted the full letter. )\u000aHachette keeps the publisher-friendly agency model\u000aThe updated pact won't take effect until early 2015, but Hachette claims Amazon will soon restore normal supply levels of Hachette-published books and once again offer them for pre-order. During the face-off, Amazon had pushed for a bigger cut of revenues \u2014 all while pressuring Hachette to keep its ebooks priced at $9.99 and below. As negotiations stalled out, the powerful online seller put a bottleneck on its stock of Hachette-published titles, leading to significant delays that impacted a massive roster of authors.\u000aAs their feud spilled out into the public eye, each side tried to rally authors and the public.  Amazon insisted that Hachette favored "unjustifiably high" ebook prices between $14.99 and $19.99, while Hachette painted Amazon as an overbearing bully. For its part, Amazon says the new pact contains "financial incentives" that will encourage Hachette to keep ebooks affordable for its many Kindle customers. Hachette wasn't alone in its frustration with Amazon; Simon & Schuster went through its own volatile negotiation period with the leading bookseller. It too recently managed to  strike a new deal with Amazon .\u000a

VAlcatel's Hero 2+ will come to the US with Cyanogen OS | The Verge

aVAlcatel's Hero 2+ will come to the US with Cyanogen OS\u000aThe 6-inch phablet will be available in the US this spring\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aToday at Mobile World Congress, Cyanogen and Alcatel announced the Hero 2+, a 6-inch smartphone that will come with Cyanogen OS preinstalled. The Hero 2+ is a variation of the Hero 2 Alcatel released globally last year, and features a 6-inch, 1080p display, a 2GHz octacore Mediatek processor, 2GB of RAM, a 13-megapixel camera, support for LTE on AT&T and T-Mobile, and a stylus. It will be available in North America this spring for $299 unlocked.\u000aCyanogen OS is already available on a handful of smartphones across the world, including the Oppo N1, OnePlus One, and devices in India. The Hero 2+ will run Cyanogen OS 11, which is based on Android 4.4.4 KitKat, though it will likely be upgraded to newer version of the software as it is released. Alcatel says that the Hero 2's unique features, including the snap on LED covers and stylus will be supported in the Hero 2+ with Cyanogen OS.\u000aAll of the Hero 2's unique accessories and features will work in CyanogenMod\u000aCyanogen has grown as a company since it was just a modification for Android phones designed to make the devices perform better and be easier to use than with their original software. The company's mission is to spread an "open Android" that is less reliant on Google's services. "We want to eliminate the problem of bloatware by enabling more powerful apps that hook deeper into the system," said cofounder Steve Kondik in a recent interview.\u000aNot everyone shares Cyanogen's vision however. In a talk earlier today , Google's head of product (which includes Android) Sundar Pichai noted that he doesn't yet know the value proposition in Cyanogen OS, or versions of Android that bypass Google's services, such as the Play Store, Maps, and Gmail, in general. "I\u2019d question the premise of building something without Google\u2019s services ... these are services users ask for on their devices," said Pichai.\u000aFor its part, Cyanogen OS does offer Google services in all of the countries where they are supported, and Kondik says the whole platform is Google compliant. Earlier today, Cyanogen announced a new partnership with Qualcomm that puts its software on reference devices Qualcomm provides to handset makers. The reference devices with Cyanogen's software will be low-end to mid-range devices, and should benefit from the performance enhancements Cyanogen OS generally brings to underspecced phones.\u000aAlcatel and Cyanogen say that the Hero 2+ is just the first fruits of a partnership that will result in multiple devices this year and next. Perhaps one of those will be a new Idol 3 running Cyanogen?\u000aCorrection: The article originally said that Hero2+ ships with CyanogenMod. The included software is known as Cyanogen OS. We've updated the post to reflect this.\u000a
