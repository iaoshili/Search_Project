aV'Please don't bring drones to the Super Bowl,' says FAA in dystopian PSA\u000aIn the future, only the finest rhyming PSAs will survive\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe FAA has produced a YouTube video encouraging attendees of the Super Bowl to "leave your drone at home." The video, titled "No Drone Zone," resembles other public service announcements, using stock photos like many anti-smoking ads and a diabolical head rhyme like  "Don't Copy That Floppy."\u000aI've heard of end zones, but drone zones? What a country!\u000aWhile it's encouraging to see the FAA being proactive about drones, which can fall out of the sky anywhere \u2014 from your backyard to the  White House \u2014 a better method for protecting citizens from the misuse of drones would be proper policy. Until then, we're left with these short videos that, five years ago, would have scanned as fake PSAs from alternate reality sci-fi films. When people ask when we'll live in the future, show them this video. Nothing is more futuristic than a boring government video kindly asking the public to refrain from bringing smart flying robots that could be used to bring unspeakable horror to the most televised event in the country.\u000aFor your enjoyment, here's another FAA video I can't believe is real.\u000aYes, I would like to receive a daily newsletter from The Verge and occasional dedicated newsletters from sponsors and/or partners.\u000aForgot password?\u000aWe'll email you a reset link.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot username?\u000aWe'll email it to you.\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aForgot password?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aForgot username?\u000aIf you signed up using a 3rd party account like Facebook or Twitter, please login with it instead.\u000aTry another email?\u000aAlmost done,\u000aBy becoming a registered user, you are also agreeing to our Terms and confirming that           you have read our Privacy Policy .\u000aAuthenticating\u000aGreat!\u000aChoose an available username to complete sign up.\u000aIn order to provide our users with a better overall experience, we ask for more information from Facebook when using it to login so that we can learn more about our audience and provide you with the best possible experience.

V6 reasons to be terrified about the future of transportation | The Verge
p5
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aThe US Department of Transportation (USDOT) just released "Beyond Traffic," a study best described as a dire warning about how the country's arterial lines will clog and implode over the next several decades. As far as USDOT secretary Anthony Foxx is concerned, pretty much everything is in bad shape and getting worse: roadways, railways, waterways, the whole nine yards.\u000aThe problems are endless: ancient infrastructure is crumbling without the money to repair or replace it. Renewable energy strategies aren't materializing quickly enough. Rapidly growing urban centers are buckling under the weight of the commuting residents that occupy them. And all the while, the specter of global warming threatens to quite literally sink everything.\u000aIn a perfect world, the DOT would be coming to the table with a slate of solutions \u2014 not problems \u2014 but it's not. Instead, it's calling Beyond Traffic "an invitation to a conversation" about how to fix things. "Everyone uses our transportation system, which means anyone can help build its future," a slide deck highlighting the study reads .\u000aHere are some of the major takeaways.\u000aWe're basically doomed unless we radically change things\u000a"America's transportation system is a fossil in 2045," reads the slide deck. That's not wrong: even today, American bridges are  regularly cited as being structurally deficient with no replacements in sight. It warns about the rise of new urban centers \u2014 "Omaha is the new LA" in the DOT's dystopian vision of the future \u2014 and rail systems so overcrowded that trains never actually stop to pick anyone up. No one can get to work.\u000aThe USDOT seems to be really excited about millennials and ride-sharing\u000aThe study makes reference to several trends unique to younger people \u2014 a downturn in driving paired with a huge uptick in the acceptance of technology. "Data enables innovative transportation options, such as car-sharing, ride-sharing, and pop-up bus services, and more rapid delivery of goods," the presentation notes. (Notably,  Ford announced at CES this year that it's testing practically all of these things.) This might ultimately be terrible news for car lovers, but great news for the environment, infrastructure budgeting, and just about everything else.\u000aSelf-driving cars are definitely happening, because the regulatory people are on board\u000aIt's widely understood that the biggest hurdle to getting self-driving cars on the roads over the next couple decades won't be a technological one \u2014 it's regulatory. Lawmaking is almost always a bureaucratic nightmare, with special interests pulling strings and naysayers gumming up the works. For companies like Google and major automakers pursuing their own self-driving projects, though, this is probably good news: Beyond Traffic makes reference to the advent of driverless tech. "Imagine eliminating 9 out of every 10 car crashes. That's the bright promise driverless technology holds over the next 30 years," the presentation reads. A three-decade time horizon probably isn't what Google has in mind, but at least they've got the Department of Transportation talking about it in a sharply positive light.\u000aFreight is a huge problem, and it's going to get bigger\u000aPeople like stuff, it turns out \u2014 and that stuff has to move around the globe. It's got to get built, get distributed, and get delivered. All of that takes energy and space on the road, the rail, and the water.\u000aObviously, that's a particularly thorny problem to solve, because in a healthy economy, you still want stuff moving from producer to consumer. There aren't any good answers in the study, but part of the solution could simply come from more efficient routing of cargo traffic: there's the FAA's  NextGen air traffic control , for instance, which the report calls out by name. It routes aircraft in and out of busy airports more efficiently. "Imagine your plane never has to circle the airport again, because flights are perfectly timed and the skies are clear of congestion."\u000aThe USDOT is as scared of climate change as anyone else\u000aRadically increased storm frequency, rising sea levels, and higher average temperatures will all wreak havoc on nearly every aspect of the US' transportation infrastructure \u2014 a particularly telling graphic shows how New Orleans' Louis Armstrong airport will be several feet underwater by 2045, and even deeper by 2100. Ft. Lauderdale, San Francisco, Oakland, New York's LaGuardia, and a host of other major airline hubs aren't far behind.\u000aAnd for the USDOT, the worst part of all of this is that transportation systems are among the biggest contributors to the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Tighter regulations on auto fuel economy help, but they probably don't go far enough.\u000aNo one wants to spend any money on infrastructure\u000aIt'd be one thing if the money existed to solve all of these problems and government agencies just needed to figure out how and where to spend it. But it's actually much worse: Beyond Traffic notes that the government is spending less on infrastructure when adjusted to inflation, in part because the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has remained constant over over 20 years. The study says that the trust fund tasked with repairing federal transportation infrastructure will have a shortfall of $12 billion for highway maintenance alone.\u000aAll of this comes as 65 percent of American roads are graded as being in "less than good condition," and 25 percent of bridges are in bad shape.\u000a

aVAlmost every single Xbox executive we profiled in this video last year has left the company\u000aTold you TV was a bad idea\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aBoyd Multerer \u2014 the genius Microsoft engineer who founded Xbox Live, helped build the Xbox 360, and led the development of the three-operating-systems-in-one Xbox One platform \u2014 announced on Twitter today that he's left Microsoft to pursue new opportunities. Multerer has been on leave since the Xbox One launched; he and his wife Keri launched  the interactive erotica site Silkwords back in February, and now he says he's focusing on other new startup ideas.\u000aGoodbye Microsoft. It was a good run. Xbox was Great! Time to do something new.\u000a\u2014 Boyd Multerer (@BoydMulterer) December 29, 2014\u000aBut more importantly, Multerer's departure means that almost every single person on the Xbox One team we profiled last November when that console launched has now either left the company or been reassigned under new Xbox chief Phil Spencer. Microsoft's original vision of the Xbox One as a general-purpose living room platform has been drastically scaled back \u2014 Spencer is a games guy. That focus on games is paying off, as  the Xbox One just outsold the PS4 for the first time in November . But all the people who were trying to build something bigger? Well, they're gone. Just go down the list of the people in this feature video we made \u2014 a video focused on Xbox TV:\u000aMarc Whitten, former Xbox VP, is now the Chief Product Officer at Sonos. Whitten was the biggest champion of the Xbox One as a TV platform; he and I argued about the TV integration many, many times.\u000aBen Smith, the Xbox TV program manager, is also at Sonos now.\u000aMulterer, who was in charge of the platform that enabled the Xbox One to both play games and run Windows apps, has now left.\u000aKareem Choudhry, who was in charge of Kinect development, is now director of development for all of Xbox. Kinect is how the Xbox One controls cable boxes over IR, but it's no longer bundled with the console and few games support it. And  Phil Spencer seems pretty happy the Kinect is dead .\u000aThe only person we profiled who has the same role is Jeff Henshaw, who remains Xbox group program manager. That's a big turnover \u2014 and an even bigger change of vision for Microsoft's next-generation console after former Xbox chief Don Mattrick left to become CEO of Zynga.\u000aIR blasters remain a terrible idea\u000aThe Xbox One was supposed to be the first step towards a living room revolution \u2014 it was supposed to run Windows apps, every console was supposed to be a dev unit, and deep interactive TV integration was the next big step \u2014 but there's been virtually no progress on any of those fronts since the console's bumpy launch, and the people who championed that vision are now mostly gone. The renewed focus on gaming has led to short-term sales success, but consoles last a decade, and the long-term vision is no longer clear. Microsoft says the Xbox One will run the upcoming Windows 10 operating system, which is supposed to unify the company's various products, but there have been precious few details about that plan so far. We'll have to wait to find out more.\u000aOne thing is clear, however: if your product depends on a damn IR blaster to work, it is definitely doomed to fail.\u000a

V10 Material Design Android apps you should be using right now | The Verge
p14
aV10 Material Design Android apps you should be using right now\u000aIt's a Material world and we're just living in it\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aLast year, Google unveiled its design vision for the future . Called Material Design, it incorporates bold colors, flat elements, and informative animations to create a fresh user interface for the modern age. Material Design made its major debut with the launch of Android 5.0 Lollipop in the fall, and Google has been rapidly updating its own apps and services to take advantage of the new design directives.\u000aGoogle isn't the only one that's been applying Material Design ideas to its apps: plenty of third-party Android app makers have released refreshed and overhauled apps to match Google's new platform. These apps often look and feel great, and they're typically much more enjoyable to use than older Android apps thanks to their fun animations and delightful transitions.\u000aHere are 10 Android apps that have taken advantage of Google's new tools to provide fresh takes on old ideas. (Note: if you don't yet have Android 5.0 Lollipop on your phone, you can still install and use these apps. The designs and appearances will be the same, but older phones won't support all of the animations and transitions possible with Lollipop.)\u000aAction Launcher 3\u000aAction Launcher has long provided a different take on the standard homescreen / launcher app, offering unique and useful ideas like collapsible widgets and app icons that also act as folders. The latest version of the app incorporates those ideas with Material Design transitions and animations, making for an efficient, attractive, easy-to-use homescreen for your phone. Action Launcher 3 will even automatically customize the colors and backgrounds of folders, the app drawer, and persistent search box based on your current wallpaper, offering a personalized and cohesive look with minimal effort. Action Launcher 3 is available for free , with a $4.99 in-app purchase to unlock all of its features.\u000aFalcon Pro 3\u000aTwitter has updated its own app with some Material Design elements, but if you're looking for a complete experience, Falcon Pro 3 is what you want. It's a full-featured Twitter app built around Material Design guidelines, with great typography, beautiful transitions and animations, and a buttery-fluid user experience. It also has useful features like smart refresh rates based on your usage, granular notification controls, and big, bold inline images in your timeline. Falcon Pro 3 costs $3.99 for one Twitter account, with additional accounts running $1.99 each.\u000aFeedlyReader\u000aOur favorite RSS reader for Android, Press, hasn't been updated in a long time (the makers promise that a big Material Design update is in the works), but if you're a Feedly user looking for some Material Design right now, you want FeedlyReader . The simply-named FeedlyReader has everything most people look for in a feed reader: a spartan interface, pull-to-refresh, offline caching, and quick sharing to other services. It also has a customizable color palette based on the Material Design themes, as well as delightful animations throughout. The best part is that it's free, so it's easy to switch over to this while we await the big refresh to Press.\u000aCabinet\u000aCabinet was one of the first apps to apply Google's new design directives, launching even before Android Lollipop became officially available. It's a basic file browser that makes it easy to jump between directories and access the files on your phone. Just this week I downloaded Lil Wayne's new mixtape directly to my phone and used Cabinet to unzip the file and place it in my Music folder. Cabinet is still listed as a beta, but I haven't found any reason to not rely on it full time. It's available for  free from the Play Store now .\u000aGoogle Inbox\u000aIt might be cheating to include Google's own apps in this list, but Google's Inbox is one of the best examples of Material Design in action to date, so I'd be remiss to ignore it. Inbox has everything you want from a Material Design app: bold colors, fun pull-to-refresh actions, easy one-handed navigation, and informative animations. It actually makes it fun to manage your inbox, which is no small feat. Inbox is free and requires an invite to access, though those are fairly easy to come by. Google says that support for Google Apps accounts is in the works, but for now, it's Gmail accounts only.\u000aWeather Timeline\u000aChecking the weather is one of the most common things to do on your smartphone, and Weather Timeline is the prettiest way to do it on your Android device. Weather Timeline taps into the data from Forecast.io to provide hyperlocal forecasts, precipitation alerts, radar, and more. It has a brilliantly simple interface that lets you dive in to get more information, all the way down to hour-by-hour predictions. Weather Timeline also supports Android Wear and offers a useful Dashclock widget. It's available for $0.99 .\u000aSimplenote\u000aSimplenote is my favorite cross-platform note taking app because it's just so fast and simple to use. A recent update to its Android app brings the Material Design you've been craving, along with a new dark theme. Evernote is better for more advanced note-taking, such as clipping websites and saving images, but for basic text notes, Simplenote is hard to beat. It's available for free from the Play Store now .\u000aGoogle Messenger\u000aOnce again, one of Google's own apps offers some of the best Material Design you can get. The recently released Messenger app is a straight-forward SMS and MMS app that uses Google's new design directives to the fullest. It's fast, clean, and fun to use, even customizing each conversation with a different color. I'd love to see Google add actionable notifications and iron out some of the MMS wrinkles a lot of users are seeing in it, but as far as design goes, Messenger can't be beat. You can download Messenger for free from the Google Play Store now .\u000aQuickPic\u000aQuickPic has been my go-to gallery app on Android for a long time because it's fast and easy to use. A recent update made it even better, with Material Design animations and integrated cloud storage backup. If you're not a fan of Google's Photos app, which integrates Google+ with all of the images on your device, and just want something better to use, QuickPic is where it's at. QuickPic is free and available now .\u000aGoogle Calendar\u000aLike Inbox and Messenger, Google's own Calendar app is a brilliant example of Material Design in action. Bright colors, pleasing images, and fast and informative animations all combine to make a great calendar app experience. Google Calendar's full-month view is pretty basic, but agenda list and homescreen widget are wonderfully done. Nexus device users likely have Google Calendar already on their phones, but the rest of us can download it for free from the Play Store now.\u000a

VA look at BlackBerry's softer, rounder Passport for AT&T | The Verge

aVA look at BlackBerry's softer, rounder Passport for AT&T\u000aTrading the dress suit for the sweat suit\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAt long last, those wanting to purchase one of BlackBerry's new smartphones can now do so directly from a major US carrier. Starting today, AT&T is offering the BlackBerry Passport and Classic , the two most recent smartphones from the Canadian company. The Classic AT&T is selling is exactly the same as the model that's been available directly from BlackBerry since December, complete with a throwback design that looks like it was pulled right out of 2012.\u000aBut oddly enough, AT&T's Passport (which is exclusive to the carrier for the time being) is different from the Passport BlackBerry introduced way back in September of last year. The internal hardware is essentially the same, but AT&T dictated notable changes to the design of the device that alter its character ever so slightly. It's still an awkward rectangle designed to "work wide" that requires two hands for use, and it still has the three-row hardware keyboard with touch sensitivity like the original Passport. But AT&T's version has swapped the hard corners of the original for softer, rounded edges. The layered sandwich design for the metal frame has been replaced with a more traditional band that wraps around the entire edge of the phone. And the back of the phone feels ever so slightly softer and more rounded than before.\u000aAT&T's design works better ergonomically than the original Passport\u000aThe overall effect of these changes is that AT&T's Passport is significantly less visually striking than the first Passport. If the original Passport looked as if it put on its business suit to get stuff done, the AT&T version looks like it swapped the worsted wool for a generic cotton sweat suit. In practice, AT&T's design arguably works better: it's more comfortable to hold in one hand (or two), and it's more comfortable in your pocket. Though the internal processor and specifications are the same as the first Passport, it seems that BlackBerry has been improving its software since launch, and many things (such as the camera) are faster and more responsive than before. It still takes too long to do a lot of simple tasks (such as refreshing a Twitter timeline) on BlackBerry 10, but I'm happy to see that there is noticeable forward movement.\u000aImportantly for BlackBerry, AT&T is selling the Passport (and the Classic) in all of its retail stores as well as through its online and telesales channels. The Passport runs $199.99 with a contract or $649.99 outright, while the Classic is $49.99 on contract and $419.99 outright. Both phones can be purchased on AT&T's Next installment plan, and both are available to buy starting today. In the meantime, check out images of AT&T's customized Passport below.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

V'Avengers: Age of Ultron' extended trailer has more Ultron, more Iron Man, and more Samsung | The Verge
p23
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aYou'd expect the Avengers to be using some crazy high-tech computers that Tony Stark made for them, but it turns out they're just like all of us, using tablets that you'd pick up in a store. They're not just using any old tablets, though: they're using Samsung tablets. We know this because Samsung published an "exclusive" version of  the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer this morning, but most of what's exclusive about it is a couple quick shots of product placement. We see Black Widow checking out a photo on one Galaxy tablet or another, and later, we see people running for cover outside of a Samsung store amid a huge fight. Oddly, the Samsung store actually looks like it might be empty.\u000aThere are obvious opportunities for integration with 'Guardians of the Galaxy'\u000aSamsung advertises basically everywhere, so we really shouldn't be surprised to see that it's even advertising inside of our fantasy worlds. This product placement and recut trailer comes as part of what appears to be a broad partnership between Marvel and Samsung that was announced  over the summer , with the two companies agreeing to integrate their products. That includes this product placement and new trailer, but it could later mean Marvel-branded Samsung hardware too. But even if Samsung advertising everywhere is strangely realistic, it's still something that might remove you for a moment from a huge film like this. Like James Bond using a Sony Xperia smartphone instead of something Q cooked up for him, it's distinctly odd to watch Black Widow use a tablet to help her save the world that you might be using to browse Reddit. At the very least,  we'd bet that Samsung thinks it's awesome .\u000aThe recut trailer was originally published by Samsung early this morning, though it had a few issues: the video had the trailing repeating as soon as it finished, and the second time through it didn't have any sound. Samsung pulled the trailer shortly thereafter, but it's now back online and corrected  at another source .\u000a

VAcer makes a strong play for the inexpensive smartphone market with the Liquid Jade S | The Verge
p26
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAcer hasn't exactly made a significant dent in the smartphone market, but that isn't stopping the company from trying again \u2014 CES 2015 has brought a new pair of handsets, the Liquid Z410 and the Liquid Jade S. The Jade S is the higher-end model, featuring a 5-inch, 720p screen, a 13-megapixel camera with a f/1.8 aperture, and Android 4.4 at launch (upgradable to Lollipop). It comes with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The Liquid Z410 steps the screen down to 4.5 inches with a 960 x 540 screen, while the camera only comes in at 5 megapixels. RAM and storage are dropped to 1GB and 16GB, respectively. Both phones include LTE and both appear to be running chips that we don't commonly encounter in most phones. The Jade S is running on a 64-bit, eight-core Mediatek processor, while the Z410 has a quad-core 64-bit model.\u000aIt speaks to the fact that it's not a joke to run a non-Qualcomm or Samsung processor in your phone at this point \u2014 both of these phones felt extremely snappy. Both phones responded quickly to anything I did, cameras and apps launched fast, and the experience was generally high quality. The Jade S may have only had a 720p screen, but it was bright and clear with excellent viewing angles. Unfortunately, the Z410's didn't fare so well \u2014 the low resolution didn't bother me as much as the rather grainy, washed out colors and subpar viewing angles.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aFrom a physical perspective, the Z410 again felt like a phone a few years old \u2014 it's thick and rather unremarkable, though it does have a fun trick on the back. There's a contextual button that you can assign different functions. While the phone is unlocked, you can have it always launch the app of your choice, for example, or you can long press it to bring the camera right up. The Jade S, on the other hand, felt again like a high-quality, higher end device \u2014 it's very light and thin and nestles right into your hand. The power button is unfortunately placed at the top, but you can also open it and unlock it with a screen gesture, making the button a secondary concern.\u000aThere's also a bit of voice-activated software on board \u2014 you can tell the camera to activate HDR with your voice, or you can yell "selfie" at it to switch to the front facing camera and start a 3-second countdown timer. It's all customizable, and while voice commands still haven't exactly taken the world by storm, there are definitely situations in which it could be useful.\u000aThese phones aren't exactly competition for the high-end devices we're used to buying in the US, but they do serve a market looking for a more affordable, off-contract phone that includes LTE. It's a market that Motorola started serving well with the Moto G earlier this year (though the newer Moto G and Moto E don't have LTE support). The race to build a quality, relatively inexpensive, modern phone that isn't sluggish or loaded down with bloatware out of the box is definitely a thing, and this is Acer's contribution to that market. The Jade S will launch this month for \u20ac299, while the Z410 will be available by the end of February for \u20ac129.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a
