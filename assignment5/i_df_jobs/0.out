VACLU sues to let you post photos of your voting ballot | The Verge

aVACLU sues to let you post photos of your voting ballot\u000aNew Hampshire ACLU is suing to overturn a statewide ban also found across the US\u000aShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIt's another big election year in the United States (the  midterms ), so you know what that means: people across the country will be taking photos of their completed ballots and posting them on Instagram and other social media websites. We saw it happen a lot during  the 2012 election . But as was the case back then, and long before photo-sharing apps even existed, taking photos of a completed ballot  actually remains illegal in  many parts of the US . Why? Because lawmakers over the years have sought to protect the sanctity and anonymity of the voting booth, as well as prevent tampering and undue influence on a person's vote (that is, people feeling pressured to vote a certain way outside their own independent conclusions \u2014 read more about the topic in this excellent guide from the  Digital Media Law Project ). So in many cases, people who post photos of their completed ballots online are technically at risk of getting steep fines and having their votes invalidated.\u000aBut not if the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire gets its way. The non-profit citizen rights' organization recently sued the New Hampshire state government to overturn that state's ban on photographing and posting completed ballots, as  Boston.com reports. New Hampshire recently updated its law to specifically outlaw digital photos of filled-out ballots, with fines up to $1,000 per violation. Already this year, at least three New Hampshire residents have reportedly been investigated by the attorney general for posting ballot photos on social media, including one former police officer who filled out his ballot with his dead dog's name. If the ACLU succeeds, it could finally legalize a common form of political participation and civic engagement. As the ACLU writes in its suit filing: "Displaying a photograph of a marked ballot on the Internet is a powerful form of political speech that conveys various constitutionally-protected messages that have no relationship to vote buying or voter coercion."\u000a

V7 minutes in hell: one brutal workout with the Microsoft Band and Basis Peak | The Verge
p11
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aI once believed exercise is necessarily just prolonged self-torture. I dreaded spending over an hour at the gym, which turned me into a yo-yo exerciser. For brief periods, I'd manage to find both the motivation and time in my schedule, only to fall off the wagon when my days got too busy.\u000aBut then I discovered that many top athletes exercise 20 minutes or less each workout . It turns out many of the benefits from exercise come from a precious few seconds of exhaustion, which triggers the body to build muscle in preparation for future strenuous activity.\u000aA clever group of fitness researchers at the Human Performance Institute designed a circuit training routine that brings exhaustion to most major muscle groups in 7 minutes flat.  The published results of the so-called "Scientific 7-minute workout" went viral: now, even  the New York Times and the Pebble smartwatch have apps for users eager for a convenient way to incorporate it into their routines.\u000aThe key to high-intensity burst workouts is to strike that delicate balance between collapse-to-the-floor exhaustion and a pleasant sweat. If I train too easy, my body won't think it needs to make physiological improvements; If I work too hard in the beginning, I won't be able to finish all of the movements.\u000aThe key to exercising quickly is to get your heart rate right\u000a"In my opinion, and broadly speaking, exercise intensity must be relatively high in order to gain cardiovascular conditioning from brief, interval style workouts," Martin Gibola, a short exercise-enthusiast and McMaster's Professor, wrote in an email. "That is essentially the trade-off for the reduced time commitment involved. While there is no hard and fast rule, average heart rate during the intervals should be at least ~80-85 percent of maximum."\u000aThis is where technology plays a vital role: training at the very specific 80 percent of maximum heart rate is difficult to do. (Maximum heart rate is more obvious, at least for anyone who's ever run until their knees buckled.) If I rely on solely on my intuition, the incentive to take it easy overrides my sense of intensity.\u000aGetting accurate data is important, but carrying a professional grade chest strap everywhere is a real pain in the neck. Fortunately, two new wearables,  the Basis Peak and  the Microsoft Band , promise to track my heart rate in real time.\u000aPreviously, popular health trackers only did resting heart rate (sub-130 bpm). The only non-chest strap alternative was the Mio Alpha watch \u2014 but it wasn't meant to be worn all day, so I still had to remember to carry some extra device on me.\u000aTo test out how well each of the new 24/7 wearables could handle short-burst workouts, I wore 4 devices during my workout and checked my heart rate during each minute. The baseline is the chest strap: the closer each gets to a Polar H7, a professional-grade device, the more accurate.\u000aThe workout\u000aThe scientific 7-minute workout is twelve exercises, thirty seconds each, ten seconds of rest between: jumping jacks, wall sit, pushups, crunches, step-up onto chair, squats, tricep dips on chair, plank hold, high-knee runs, lunges, pushup one-handed hold, side plank. (Since it was designed for beginners, I increased the intensity of each workout to include a jump.)\u000aMinute One, Jumping jacks: I feel like I could do this forever, and begin seriously question whether the 7-minute "workout" is even doing anything for me. I look down at my watch, and see only 144 beats per minute (and I should be at least 160). I crank jumping jacks into high gear to spike my heart rate.\u000aMinute two, jumping push-ups: I finally hit 167 bpm and am feeling a good stride. Now it feels like a workout! I bang through a dozen pushups without a rest. I got this.\u000aMinute three, jumping on onto chair: my optimism fades as I barely squeak through without stopping to rest. My effort slightly dips to 165 bpm; it's already noticeably harder to sustain the same level of effort.\u000aMinute four, tricep chair dips: I hit my runners\u2019 high. Embracing the pain, I burn through dips as fast as gravity will allow. 172 bpm. Did I overdo it? Eh, probably not.\u000aMinute 5, stationary high knee running: I definitely over did. Why did I over do it!? I get through half the 30-second sprint before slowing to a crawl. Thankfully, I'm at 170 bpm and realize I can slow down a bit as I edge toward the finish.\u000aMinute 6, jumping lunges: I get a second runners high, fueled by nothing but the optimism that I'm going to make through. I clock in at 173 dpm. I'm way overdoing it; I don't care. I will beat this damn workout! I will own it!\u000aMinute 7, holding one-arm side plank: I realize how long seven minutes of pain can seem. I push as hard as I can to maintain good form, barely holding myself up from falling. As the time buzzes, I collapse to the ground. I made it.\u000aIt is here, on the floor, covered in sweat, that I realize 7 minutes can, indeed, be workout. My heart rate proves that.\u000aThroughout the workout, the Microsoft Band was consistently closest to the chest strap, though it did occasionally vary in a big way. And not only does it record exercise-grade heart rate with impressive accuracy, it also has a function to automatically count reps. I could program my own version of the 7-minute workout and know whether I was improving over time, by seeing if I could perform more reps during each workout in the future. As such, it it now my default fitness band.\u000aPolar chest strap\u000a

VA Snapchat Easter egg is hiding in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 | The Verge
p14
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aIt's not going to surprise anyone that there's probably a new Call of Duty title coming out. But yesterday, some players discovered a weird, fairly subtle little Easter egg that seems to hint at the next game. As demonstrated by streamer Drift0r and a photo on Twitter , the 2012 game Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 got a mysterious update earlier this week. The update, which has apparently come to Xbox  and PlayStation 3 but not PC, seems to have changed a specific poster that can be found in a couple of the maps, adding a distinctive symbol: Snapchat's QR code-like ghost stamp, which lets users add a friend by scanning it.\u000aUnsurprisingly, this particular code points you to the Call of Duty Snapchat account. Once you've befriended it \u2014 as we did \u2014 you'll get a new snap:\u000a\u2014 Nick (@Nipple_Nicholas) April 7, 2015\u000aDrift0r and others fairly credibly guess that this is a teaser for Black Ops 3, although nothing so specific shows up in the hint. Even if you don't care at all about Call of Duty, it's a cute and pretty distinctive trick. Snapchat's contact codes were only rolled out  a few months ago ; they're not precisely cryptic, but unlike a standard-issue QR code, they're also immediately understandable. With E3 and all its attendant game announcements just around the corner, it might even be worth keeping an eye out for more ghosts.\u000a

VAlcatel's new smartwatch is a cheaper Moto 360 that works with the iPhone | The Verge
p20
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aAlcatel first revealed details of its upcoming smartwatch a few days ago, and now we're getting our first chance to check it out and get more details on what will set this device apart from its Android Wear competition. Perhaps most notable is the fact that the Alcatel Onetouch Watch will support both iOS and Android devices, something that sets it apart from nearly every other smartwatch on the market (with the notable exception of the Pebble line of watches).\u000aMuch like Android Wear, Alcatel's Watch is controlled through a companion app for iOS and Android \u2014 from there you can do things like pick which apps will notify you, view all your health data the watch has collected, adjust themes and colors for the watch, and generally manage all of the ways the watch can communicate with your phone. If you're using an Android phone, any app that can send notifications can push them to the phone, but iOS appears to be more limited, at least for now. We know Apple's phone, messaging, and mail apps will work with the Watch, but third-party support appears to be up in the air.\u000aSee all the latest CES 2015 news here \u203a\u000aThe main interface itself is controlled not by swiping the screen, but by tapping near the bottom edge of the Watch. When you raise your wrist, the screen activates (similar to the Apple Watch), and tapping will cycle between the watch face and the menu, which is a colorful, Windows-style scroll of the apps that can run directly on the watch. Unfortunately, the interface isn't quite as fluid and responsive as most Android Wear devices we've tried, but it's certainly useable enough. That said, trying to hit the small "home" area at the bottom of the watch is occasionally frustrating.\u000aAnother way Alcatel says its smartwatch will stand out is in the battery department: the company says it'll can last at least two days, and possible up to five under the right circumstances. Android Wear, on the other hand, has been generally disappointing in the battery department, and Apple has strongly hinted that you'll need to charge its Watch every day as well.\u000aSUPPORT FOR ANDROID AND IOS IS GREAT, BUT THE INTERFACE NEEDS A LITTLE WORK\u000aAs for the wearable's main features, Alcatel has given us a bit more info than we had the other day. From a health monitoring perspective, the Watch will use its build-in heart rate monitor, accelerometer, gyroscope, altimeter and e- compass to measure the usual metrics like sleep cycles, steps taken, distance traveled, and calories burned. The other expected feature is the aforementioned notifications and multimedia control \u2014 It'll also vibrate if you get a certain distance away from your phone, and you can use the Watch to make your phone ring if you misplace it. Tapping the screen also brings up multimedia controls, and you can use it as a remote shutter for your phone's camera, as well.\u000aFrom a style perspective, the Watch will come in four versions \u2014 two "micro-textured resin" models in black / red and white as well as two metal options \u2014 unfortunately, those metal options aren't coming out until later this year. It feels much like a Moto 360 (right down to the small missing slice at the bottom of the watch's interface), though it's a bit smaller and lighter than the Motorola. The band itself feels fine on the wrist, though the clasp is a bit awkward to use. What isn't awkward is the small, hidden, USB charging port \u2014 a much better option for powering up your Watch than the goofy docks or proprietary cables that most smartwatches use.\u000aWhile the Alcatel Onetouch Watch didn't quite feel like the most polished product we've ever seen, its entry price of $149 currently undercuts most ever Android Wear device out there. But the Watch doesn't appear to offer any features that you can't get on Android Wear, and it doesn't have Google's nice voice-activated commands and search options. If you're an iOS user, however, and think the Apple Watch will be too rich for your blood, Alcatel's watch might be worth a look. It'll be available this March and will be on sale at Amazon.\u000aHint: Use the 's' and 'd' keys to navigate\u000a

VA creepy viral marketer sent a photo of my girlfriend\u2019s cat to my apartment | The Verge
p23
aVShare on Facebook Tweet Share Pin Share\u000aUnder most circumstances, I\u2019m actually a pretty big fan of viral marketing. Whether you\u2019re talking about a  mysterious cell phone or an  elaborate alternate reality game , it\u2019s fun to have the line between our reality and a fictional world blurred just a little. It might not always work \u2014 okay, most of the time it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 but when everything clicks into place, it\u2019s like you\u2019re Neo in The Matrix: nothing around you is what it seems, and you\u2019re the hero of the story.\u000aSo I was pretty excited when a couple of days ago a stranger was waiting outside my door with a big box wrapped with a bow. Inside was a note along with something very cool: a heat-sensitive Tetris coffee mug. I remembered them from back in the \u201880s \u2014 I\u2019ve been  obsessed with the \u201880s lately \u2014 but then I read the note. "Thank you for letting me borrow your Game Boy when we were younger," it read. "Remember all the hours of Tetris?"\u000aIt was signed with a Twitter handle, @YourFriendGordo, and a look at the back revealed the logo for a company named STX Entertainment. A quick Google search later, it was obvious this was all about a new Jason Bateman movie called The Gift, in which Bateman\u2019s character is harassed by an old friend named Gordo (Joel Edgerton, who also writes and directs) over some past perceived wronging.\u000aTetris coffee mug courtesy of @YourFriendGordo . Look like marketing for The Gift - does Edgerton visit my house next? pic.twitter.com/RpKriHXkzJ\u000a\u2014 Bryan Bishop (@bcbishop) March 31, 2015\u000aThe thing was, I really liked Tetris on the Game Boy growing up. It was the only game I ever had for the handheld, and I played it all the time. It all just seemed to be a coincidence of groupthink nostalgia, but then I noticed that many other journalists had also received packages, each with their own personalized gift.\u000aThere was a reason the folks behind The Gift knew I was a Tetris Game Boy fan:  I\u2019d mentioned it on Twitter last year .\u000aThat could have been a step across the line (and for some it was), but I loved it. Somebody was out there, poring over people\u2019s Twitter feeds, and injecting a jolt of that alternate reality game vibe \u2014 "ARG" for those of us who pour over these things \u2014 into my Tuesday. When the trailer for The Gift came out the following day, it was even clearer what was going on, and the green wrapping on the box I received made even more sense.\u000aThen yesterday, there was another knock on my door. I opened it up to the sound of someone running away down the stairs. I looked out my apartment window, but couldn\u2019t see anybody outside. There was a sketchy-looking white van, but if I got freaked out about every sketchy-looking white van in Sherman Oaks I\u2019d never leave the house.\u000aBy my open door was a thin green envelope, my name hand-written on it, and sealed with a glob of wax imprinted with a "G." I was excited. What was it going to be? How much more creepy could "Gordo" get?\u000aAs it turns out\u2026 a lot more creepy.\u000aInside were four Polaroid-style prints. I recognized the first as an Instagram picture I\u2019d posted years ago. Another, of me  on a plane to CES (with some creepy guy with a monkey mask photoshopped into the background). The third was my girlfriend\u2019s cat.\u000aI\u2019m allergic to cats, which means they all immediately want to crawl all over me at every waking hour. It\u2019s a small thing, but it can create awkward moments, especially when your partner loves their pet. My girlfriend does, and for good reason: her cat Ruby is amazing, and I\u2019ve totally become one of those people that  endlessly posts cat pictures because I simply can\u2019t stand the adorableOMGcuteness that Ruby exudes.\u000aBut despite the fact that I\u2019m posting these pictures for the entire internet to see, those moments with Ruby still feel personal. They\u2019re intimate, no matter how large the size of the potential audience, and to receive one back at first felt disturbing \u2014 which I liked \u2014 and then like a violation. You can use pictures of me to market your movie, but you can\u2019t use pictures of the cat, dammit.\u000aYou can use pictures of me, but you can't use pictures of the cat, dammit\u000aThen there was the final snapshot. Last year at SXSW I got to meet Bill Cosby. At the time, it was a fun experience and I couldn\u2019t have been more excited to  share it online . Since then, well\u2026 my feelings about Bill Cosby have changed. I\u2019ve thought several times about deleting that picture from my Instagram feed \u2014 I certainly wasn\u2019t comfortable with the idea of it being perceived as any kind of tacit endorsement \u2014 but I always came back to the same conclusion. That it was a moment in time that I had documented online, and I should let it be just that. But that\u2019s before it was printed out and sent to me in a green envelope.\u000aWas I being judged by the marketers? Did they intentionally pick that image, knowing that it would upset me? Did they think I should be ashamed by it \u2014 and why the hell did I even care?\u000aThat\u2019s where The Gift got in its own way. The folks selling the movie want me thinking about the film, but instead I\u2019m thinking about myself. Their antics were certainly effective \u2014 hey, I\u2019m writing this article right now, aren\u2019t I? \u2014 and I have no larger ethical beef about the campaign itself. But when the line between the thriller movie and reality is blurred, it\u2019s only fun when you know you\u2019re on the safe side.\u000a
